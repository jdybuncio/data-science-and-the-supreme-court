2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,0.0,7.43,We will now hear argument in the case of Kelo vs. City of New London.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,9.66,12.715,"Justice O'Connor, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,48.935,75.213,"Mr. Bullock, you are leaving out that New London was in a depressed economic condition, so this is distinguished from the case where the state has no particular reason for wanting this, but the critical fact on the city side, at least, is that this was a depressed community and they wanted to build it up, get more jobs."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,75.213,89.248,"Well, Your Honor, it's important to point out in the first place that chapter 132 of the statutory section at issue here applies to every city within the State of Connecticut, not those that are simply depressed."
2004.04-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,108.362,112.16,"But you concede that on the facts, more than tax revenue was at stake."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,119.136,125.246,--It is a desire to try to improve the economy through tax revenue and jobs.
2004.04-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.653,156.371,"You don't concede, or do you, that elevating a city from a depressed to prosperous is a better justification than elevating a city from prosperous to more prosperous?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,156.371,159.51,"--That is not... that is correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.228,181.717,"The line you draw is between blight, which Berman says was a legitmate public use, blighted conditions okay, but depressed conditions, not so that's the line we would draw--"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,181.717,182.626,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.571,213.751,"Oh, but Berman spoke, in the opinion, said that the determination of the legislature about these things is virtually conclusive, that there is only the narrowest, narrowest role for the judiciary."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,222.174,230.758,"Your Honor, it is clear that eminent domain power is broad, but there has to be limits, and that's what we are really talking about here."
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.758,237.073,"Well, have we ever in any case from this Court said that the limit has been exceeded?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,237.073,256.103,"In a few cases from earlier in this century, Your Honor, the Missouri Pacific case, the Thompson versus Consolidated Gas case, but this Court has recognized for over 200 years that there are limits on eminent domain power, that they cannot be used for private takings."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,259.325,274.845,"Justice Douglas says there that as long as it's an objective within Congress and legislature's legitimate grant of power, they can do it, I mean, as long as there's a... so why does there have to be a limit within that broad limit?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,274.845,279.592,"--Well, Your Honor, the limit is that there cannot be takings for private use."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,279.592,281.904,"Of course, there can't, purely."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,309.785,313.317,"Your Honor, we think that that cuts way too broadly."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,313.317,313.772,Because?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,313.772,320.254,"Because then every property, every home, every business can then be taken for any private use."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,320.254,320.542,No.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,330.118,336.723,"Well, again, the eminent domain power is broad, but there has to be limits."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,336.723,338.542,"Now, that's, of course, my question."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,350.18,361.78,"Well, Your Honor, I think with public... with just having a simple public benefit, then there really is no distinction between public and private uses."
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.01,378.006,But do you think those were correctly decided or do you take issue with the decision in those two cases?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,378.006,387.749,"--We think that those decisions can be consistent with ruling in favor of Petitioners in this particular case, Your Honor, because--"
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.749,407.727,"But you take the position that a city that is suffering from enormous lack of jobs and depression, economic depression, that there is no public use purpose for taking land to enable the creation of jobs?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,407.727,408.926,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.602,431.893,"Well, let's assume that the city instead of taking the property by eminent domain simply used its, its own... some of its own regular tax income to buy up the property, and assembled parcels of land with the purpose of selling them to an industrial developer to raise the tax base and hence ultimately to raise taxes."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,443.782,453.979,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the question goes to whether or not the government could use its police power to acquire property and then sell it to a private developer."
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,453.979,456.292,"Well, I'm not interested in the label."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,488.447,489.273,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,492.701,493.239,Why isn't there a public purpose here?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,493.239,500.836,"Well, Your Honor, because this case affects the eminent domain power, which is regulated by the Fifth Amendment--"
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,500.836,509.631,"No, but we are talking about... I mean, I realize that, but I mean, I thought your point was that it was use of eminent domain power for an improper purpose."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,534.151,538.238,"--Your Honor, because of the public use restriction of the Amendment."
2004.04-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.467,544.182,"Mr. Bullock, do you equate purpose with use?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,554.129,555.904,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.904,558.133,That's your answer to Justice Souter.
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,558.133,565.358,But if that is your answer then the slum clearance cases have got to go the other way.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,565.358,566.389,I'm sorry--
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,566.389,572.129,"If that is your answer, then I suppose the slum clearance cases were wrongly decided."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,572.129,580.507,"--Well, your Honor, this Court did hold in Berman and Midkiff that the police power and eminent domain power are coterminous."
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,593.593,607.068,"But you are saying we don't have to reexamine it, but I think your adoption of Justice Scalia's approach puts you in a difficult... I think you're moving in the direction of saying we really have got to overrule the prior cases."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,607.068,616.05,"Your Honor, I think under a... perhaps an original understanding of the takings clause, there was a difference between public use and public domain."
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,616.05,618.113,"Just for the moment, what about my question?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,635.946,645.317,"Your Honor, I don't think so, because of the caveat in Berman and Midkiff that eminent domain cannot be used for private uses."
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.671,656.341,But that's what they were being used for in Berman and... everybody knows that private developers were the beneficiaries in Berman.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,656.341,672.605,"--Your Honor, I believe the justifications focused upon the removal of the offensive conditions in Berman, that the public purpose, if you want to call it that, was served once the blight was removed, the public purpose was served once the oligopoly was broken up."
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,672.605,685.32,"As I understand, you're testing... you want me to make a distinction between blight which is a permissible governmental use, governmental objective and economic revival, which isn't?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,685.32,689.324,"Under the eminent domain authority, Your Honor, we think that--"
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,689.324,691.014,Is that the line you want me to draw.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,691.014,691.386,--Yes.
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.312,703.934,"Well, suppose an economist or even the judge might say, well, it's very clear that if this economic depression continues for another five years we are going to have blight."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,709.014,709.757,--Exactly.
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.763,733.989,"Why isn't it an objective criteria to say that we are going to have economic revival, avoid economic downturns?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,733.989,746.825,"Well, Your Honor, because, I think... to get back to the decisions in Berman and Midkiff, what this Court I think focused on there is that the public use or the public purpose was direct and immediate."
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.176,770.519,That's the same thing that is true in the railroads in the west.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,770.519,772.005,--But--
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,772.005,776.381,Precisely the description you gave applied to the railroads in the west.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,776.381,785.919,"--Well, Your Honor, those were justified under I think the line of cases that held that those were really essential for land assembly for instrumentalities of commerce."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,786.323,793.804,And this seems to be really essential for the purpose of developing industrial property to increase the tax base.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,823.087,829.015,"--Your Honor, there are many ways to do economic development without condemnation."
2004.04-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.74,867.298,"--Even though in Berman, there was a department store that was not blighted, and it was permissible because the whole area was to be improved to raze that department store, even though it wasn't contributing in any way to blight."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,867.298,869.344,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,890.787,896.465,"Mr. Bullock, would you articulate the test that you would propose the Court adopt."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,910.128,912.728,"--Well, for our bright line rule, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,912.728,913.1,Yes.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,913.1,923.836,The test should be that the government cannot take property simply so that the new owners can put it to ordinary private uses of land.
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,925.656,928.999,"Well, that's not what's asserted here, of course."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,938.659,940.699,"--True, Your Honor, but--"
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,940.699,943.2,So what do we do with that alleged purpose?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,945.058,947.121,"--Well, the test, Your Honor, for--"
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.121,949.804,Is it no economic development purpose?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,949.804,950.836,--Yes.
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,985.47,986.396,The latter.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1002.727,1014.632,"Well, the dissent in the Connecticut Supreme Court talked a lot about minimum standards that should be in place in order to ensure that public benefits actually come about."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1025.511,1027.74,"No, I mean, are you advocating particular ones?"
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1027.74,1034.528,"Not particular ones, just the standard actually be in place and we think that the dissent provides some good guide posts for establishing--"
2004.04-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.528,1042.934,Isn't that in effect changing the test from public use to efficient public use?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1056.719,1057.462,--No.
2004.04-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.999,1065.074,Do you want us to sit here and evaluate the prospects of each condemnation one by one?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1065.074,1075.339,"No, Your Honor, what we are advocating for, and utilities of course are justified, have long been justified under a separate line of cases, common carrier regulations."
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1096.265,1114.924,"I take it there isn't, but maybe there is, there isn't any question in this case that the city was acting in good faith and did... and I presume still does... intend to convey it to developers who will, will actually proceed to develop a project."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1116.494,1118.268,A question of whether or not the procedure--
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1118.268,1146.792,"Yeah, in other words, I can understand perfectly well, why we would want to draw a distinction between the use of the eminent domain power that takes a parcel of property from private person A and simply then reconveys it to private person B without any particular object in mind except that the city likes B, you know, the mayor is a Democrat and B is a Democrat."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1175.11,1176.514,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1180.479,1182.169,Is there a reason in this case?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1183.201,1189.888,"--Well, it goes to the doubt about whether or not the public benefits will actually come about in this case."
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1198.062,1210.488,But do you really want courts to be in the business of trying to weigh the evidence to see if the utility will be successful or the hospital will be successful or the road will be well constructed?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1212.634,1226.669,"--Your Honor, our test is limited really to the condemnations that are completely dependent upon the private businesses actually being successful, and that those benefits coming about so it would not affect utilities or anything like that."
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.97,1242.538,Does the record tell us anything about how often takings by eminent domain for economic development occur in this country?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1245.966,1248.921,"It is, it is frequent, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.875,1282.851,"In all of those cases, I think the economic feasibility or economic success test would have been easily met."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1324.75,1328.259,There may be some scholarship about that.
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1337.093,1340.52,And you have to prescind the project when you fix the value.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1340.52,1341.923,--I'm sorry?
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1341.923,1349.536,You have to prescind the project... you have to... you have to ignore the project when you determine the value.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1353.811,1355.297,"Yes, that is right."
2004.04-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1356.29,1369.332,But what I am asking is if there has been any scholarship to indicate that maybe that compensation measure ought to be adjusted when A is losing property for the economic benefit of B.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1369.332,1376.019,"--I believe there has been some scholarship about it, but we think it's vital that there be a public use requirement."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1376.019,1377.384,Can I ask you about the standard.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1378.415,1378.87,Yes.
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.87,1389.877,I gather that the Iowa courts have a standard that includes whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the intended public use will take place.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1392.244,1412.239,"It's similar to our reasonable foreseeability test that we set forth in our brief that this Court actually talked about in the Vester case as well, and a number of the other state cases that are cited in our brief that establish that there has to be a use for the property and that that use has to be reasonably perceived."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1412.239,1414.097,Is there a lot of disagreement about this?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1414.097,1414.923,"No, there's not."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1414.923,1425.697,"I mean, it seems to me you might... whether there is a reasonable assurance that there will in fact be the public use which the state uses as the justification for taking the property."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1430.155,1434.78,I think it will provide important minimal standards of protection for--
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.78,1443.713,"Well, I mean, I don't see how this Court could get into the business of saying you have to have this by a particular day or you have to have 14 witnesses."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1446.213,1449.724,"--Your Honor, I think just the standard needs to be in place."
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1449.724,1451.332,There needs to be a reasonable assurance.
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1451.332,1452.075,Exactly.
2004.04-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.668,1466.237,"Well, they might well need it here."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1466.237,1469.33,"--Not in this case, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1469.33,1471.931,But do you do that area by area?
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1477.049,1477.421,Right.
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1477.421,1491.333,"And there's some scheduled to be developed first, you say that your clients lived in parcels that are not likely to be developed soon, if at all."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1502.662,1503.676,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.235,1522.131,"So it's not the area development but this house, will there be... is it reasonably likely that there will be development in that particular plot."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1522.131,1528.984,"--In this particular parcel, that is correct, Your Honor, and that has been supported by really just about every condemnation decision--"
2004.04-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1528.984,1532.412,"Let me ask you, I'm sorry, I'll make this a quick question."
2004.04-108,0,40999,scott_g_bullock,,1553.876,1558.047,"--Your Honor, because that does not really provide any protection to property owners."
2004.04-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.448,1586.487,--Very well.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1587.867,1607.746,"Justice O'Connor, and may it please the Court: The principal purpose of the takings clause is to provide for just compensation."
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.319,1615.837,"Well, but it has to be for a valid public use."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1615.837,1616.746,"--Yes, it does, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1616.746,1617.284,Okay.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1617.284,1630.576,"I completely agree with that, but if the primary purpose of the takings clause is not to regulate legislative determinations of that, but it seems to me that what the opposition is asking for is two tests."
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1654.436,1657.53,"But he doesn't... he doesn't, his second test does not adopt that."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1667.728,1668.758,"--Yes, Justice Breyer."
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1675.53,1678.213,"That may be, but what do you think of that test?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1678.213,1679.245,"--I don't, I don't agree."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1718.709,1726.178,"Mr. Horton, what, what difference does it make that, that New London was in an economic depression?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1745.868,1748.097,--I would not draw a line.
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.097,1748.635,You wouldn't.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1750.288,1756.621,I would not ask... I have a backup argument that you do not need to reach that issue here in light of the facts of this case.
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.837,1763.867,Any city can do it.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1784.589,1785.992,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.882,1798.253,No.
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1805.683,1812.704,"For example, Motel 6 and the city thinks, well, if we had a Ritz-Carlton, we would have higher taxes."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1813.364,1814.311,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1821.992,1830.37,"Well, if that, if that's so then the occasional statements that we see in the writing that you can't take from A to give to B is just wrong?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1830.37,1830.825,--No.
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1834.373,1840.606,"You think you can't take from A to give to B, that there is some substance and force to that proposition?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1840.606,1841.615,There is some force to it.
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.101,1843.578,Let me qualify it.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1847.998,1850.72,--If it's a significant amount.
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.851,1853.404,I'll accept that.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1858.772,1859.432,--With that--
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.432,1860.797,You accept that as a proposition?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1860.797,1861.252,"--I do, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1861.252,1865.877,"But without the addition, I'd please like an answer to your question."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1865.877,1866.536,I'm sorry.
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1866.536,1873.019,There are statements in our cases that say you cannot take from A just to give to B.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1873.019,1873.323,Yes.
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1873.323,1879.001,Do you agree that there is substance to that proposition and that that proposition is correct?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1879.001,1879.844,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1881.602,1884.574,But isn't that exactly what happened in Berman?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1884.574,1889.032,"--Your Honor, in Berman, the... what has--"
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1889.032,1893.574,Isn't that exactly what always happens unless it's for a firehouse or a school?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1893.574,1907.608,"--Your Honor, my position is that purely taking from one person to give to another that shows no public benefit other than just giving from... taking from one person to another would not be a public use."
2004.04-108,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1974.193,1986.082,"Is that what the Connecticut Supreme Court that we are reviewing said, you... you are arguing, it seems to me, for something that goes beyond what was adjudicated in this case."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,1986.825,1987.28,--Yes.
2004.04-108,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1987.28,2002.762,"--It was a finding, a finding before to be a fact in the trial court that this development was going to be primarily for the benefit of the citizens of New London, and not for the benefit of Pfizer or the private developer."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2002.762,2003.998,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.515,2017.085,Is that a factual finding?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2019.025,2020.8,I think it's a mixed question of fact and law--
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.8,2025.053,"Well, that this is primarily for the benefit of the city of New London, not for the benefit of a--"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2025.053,2027.033,--I consider that--
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.033,2032.234,"--In the eye of the beholder, to whom do you think this does greater benefit to, not a factual finding."
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2032.234,2054.69,"When, when there is no condemnation to acquire property for the direct use of the public, as for a public right of way, or a utility path or something, where it's purely economic development, is there any reason why we shouldn't draw a clear line and say that isn't a public purpose."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2060.181,2068.065,"--Well, for one thing we have in this case, and this comes back to the point about this particular case, is a severe assembly problem."
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2075.596,2077.931,"Well, let's look at the specifics here."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2080.864,2081.812,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2081.812,2089.447,So what are these parcels of the people now before us going to be used for?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2089.447,2090.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2129.451,2130.77,Let's talk about the litigants.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2130.77,2130.936,--Yes.
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2130.936,2132.051,Before us today.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2132.051,2132.134,Yes.
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.592,2147.904,What's planned for 3 and 4-A?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2147.904,2151.991,--What's planned for 3 is that it's going to be office space.
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.235,2225.385,"Well, can't the courts at least... can't the courts, could the courts... do you object to this, and I'm not advocating it, I want your reaction."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2225.385,2226.007,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2226.007,2234.467,"Could the courts, under this clause, at least review what you've just said for reasonableness?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2278.391,2283.592,"No, Your Honor, if what you're defining as reasonableness is being higher than rational basis."
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.855,2312.942,"Well, the reason that you would apply a somewhat higher standard is because the rational basis, with tremendous deference, applies to the power of Congress to act in an economic area in the absence of a particular constitutional provision designed to protect a minority from the actions of the majority."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2332.177,2339.624,"--Your Honor, that same type of remark could be made about rational basis equal protection review."
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.624,2345.014,"Oh, and indeed with equal protection, we very often do have a somewhat higher standard of review."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2345.014,2352.156,"Ah, yes, Your Honor, but the point here is that you should not have a higher standard of review because we are paying for it."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.384,2368.874,"Mr. Horton, you're paying for it, but you're also taking property from somebody who doesn't want to sell it."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2380.27,2382.043,"--No, of course not, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2382.043,2405.26,"Well, then, let me ask... would, would the reasonableness standard, if the project is indeed reasonable, and there is genuine prospect that all of these good things that you're talking about will happen, why wouldn't private money come in to further the project?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2435.336,2440.909,"Your Honor, there are some plaintiffs who are not going to sell at any price."
2004.04-108,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2467.947,2473.52,"How much, how much of this was voluntarily sold, is that correct?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2473.52,2482.248,"The large share of it was, but of course, that's because there is always in the background the possibility of being able to condemn it."
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.491,2495.318,That may be.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2535.563,2537.876,"I have two responses to that, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.565,2607.395,Common carriers are subject to state regulation to a degree that private companies are not.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2622.339,2637.571,"--Well, I would like to point out that the... there is a difference, the whole point is about having a test about reasonable assurances about whether something is going to happen and that's where the railroad case makes a difference."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.571,2638.436,I agree with you on that.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2638.436,2640.294,"That's the only point I was making, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2693.853,2698.123,"No, I'm accepting that you can't make that kind of a distinction."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2710.821,2711.314,--Yes.
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2737.487,2750.324,"It does seem ironic that 100 percent of the premium for the new development goes to the, goes to the developer and to the taxpayers and not to the property owner."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2750.324,2754.055,"Well, that's an interesting point."
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2759.035,2760.149,The compensation measures.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2760.149,2761.098,--The compensation measures.
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2793.686,2805.559,"On that point, just in Connecticut, if the property owner goes to the jury and receives more than the state offered, does the state also have to pay those attorneys' fees?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2805.559,2807.909,Under... under state law?
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2807.909,2819.221,"Under Connecticut law, if the property owner is offered $100 but goes to the jury and gets $200, does the property owner have to pay the attorneys' fees or does the state pay the attorneys' fees?"
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2819.221,2821.634,"The state does not pay attorneys' fees, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2833.916,2861.658,"Mr. Horton, what do you think is the reason that there are not a lot of examples of the sort that I think one of Justice O'Connor's hypotheticals raised, in which the, I don't know, the Econoline Motel gets condemned so that the Ritz can be built, thereby increasing tax revenue and so on, kind of parcel by parcel augmentations to the tax base and so on."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2863.599,2868.55,"I think there is two good reasons for it, and that it's a theoretical more than a practical problem."
2004.04-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2891.296,2892.616,In which case we have a different--
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2892.616,2893.98,In which case you have a different problem.
2004.04-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2895.754,2895.959,Okay.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2897.157,2900.212,"Transaction costs, but that is a serious problem."
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2935.302,2936.083,That's true.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,2995.238,3005.723,"Well, I mean, first of all, the... in Connecticut, fortunately, we have relocation loans which are involved here."
2004.04-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3022.526,3024.755,--But the loans don't make him whole.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3025.176,3025.869,That's true.
2004.04-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3025.869,3030.244,"--I mean, what bothered Justice Breyer I guess bothers a lot of us."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3042.149,3042.337,Yes.
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.215,3058.479,And that would really overrule a bunch of prior cases and really throw condemnation law into chaos.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3058.479,3058.967,Yes.
2004.04-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3080.482,3081.884,What is the remedy?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3110.204,3130.387,"--Well, the right case is in the just compensation concept, but going to your, your point, if this were here as just compensation, I would say in terms of just compensation, in deciding what the fair market value is today, you can certainly take into account the economic plan that's going into effect."
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3131.13,3132.866,Really?
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3145.414,3146.174,--Well--
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3146.174,3149.334,--Unless Connecticut law is much different from any other state.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3149.334,3152.64,"--I may have misspoken on that subject, Your Honor."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.64,3155.362,"But you know, in any case--"

2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.9,3158.584,--What this lady wants is not more money.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3186.115,3196.85,"--But as I say, Your Honor, if public use and public purpose are the same thing, which they are unless you're going to overrule Holmes' decisions from 1905 and 1906."
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.85,3200.027,It wouldn't the first of Holmes' decisions to be overruled.
2004.04-108,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3200.027,3213.585,"Well, I think you'd have to take some substantial chunks of language out of Berman as well, because Justice Douglas spoke very expansively in that case."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3213.585,3231.234,"Plus I think Holmes was right when he said that to say that the public actually has to use the property is not an appropriate meaning of the phrase, so I would not think you'd want to revisit that case, even if you want to revisit some other of Holmes' decisions."
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3269.313,3274.043,"Well, of course, the tax code does have special provisions for involuntary sales and reinvestments."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3274.043,3274.536,"Yes, it does."
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3274.536,3276.477,The tax hypothetical is not quite accurate.
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3276.477,3276.743,Yes.
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.743,3282.671,"Mr. Horton, I'm not proposing that the state has to use the property itself."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3295.136,3296.417,"Well, I don't think--"
2004.04-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3296.417,3301.618,"You can give it to a private entity, you can give it to a railroad, to some public utility."
2004.04-108,1,44967,wesley_w_horton,,3321.68,3338.582,"--Well, I don't agree, Your Honor, because I think, you know, I think if a person is without a job and if a person is not able to get basic services that they need from the town because the town can't afford it, that's just as important as a trains running on time or eliminating blight."
2004.04-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3396.644,3403.87,"Mr. Bullock, you have three and a half minutes."
2004.04-108,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3403.87,3405.522,"Mr. Bullock, do you know those four words?"
2004.04-108,2,40999,scott_g_bullock,,3405.522,3409.321,I wish I did.
2004.04-108,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3577.058,3578.423,The case is submitted.
