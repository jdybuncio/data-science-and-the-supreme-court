2016.15-423,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.395,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-423, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Company. Ms. Stetson."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,11.395,30.345,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The exceptionally low Bell v. Hood pleading standard under which a plaintiff's claims will survive dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as long as they are not wholly insubstantial or frivolous has no application in a Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act."
2016.15-423,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.09,88.08,"I take it there will be instances, or there could be instances in which the court finds that there is jurisdiction, that there is no immunity, and then as the case develops in the fact finding stages that, you know, I've made a mistake; there's immunity here."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,89.205,91.835,"It could conceivably happen, Your Honor."
2016.15-423,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,106.91,138.06,"In my -- my hypothetical, it is raised; the judge rules against it, and especially in a case like this where there's, I think, a foreign subsidiary that's incorporated in domestic -- domestically in Venezuela, then there might be questions of the extent of overlapping management and so forth. It seems to me that that might -- if there's an initial finding of no immunity, the judge might, in the course of hearing the case on the merits that, you know, really there's immunity here."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,138.9,140.31,It's certainly possible.
2016.15-423,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,145.19,146.775,"This is the opposite, where they didn't know."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,146.775,158.5,"That's -- that's precisely right, that the D.C. Circuit here concluded that because there might be not be immunity, what it said was at this stage of the litigation, it was permitting the claims against the sovereign to go forward."
2016.15-423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,158.5,172.735,"I think -- I think what you have described sounds to me like the 12(b)(6) standard, that is have you stated a claim that would entitle you to relief under this statute."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,192.22,197.93,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not -- I'm not sure that this case blends those two standards, and that's -- in that way."
2016.15-423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.42,242.39,And how did -- and how would that differ from a 12(b)(6) inquiry?
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,242.39,246.485,"It differs in a number of different respects, most importantly procedurally."
2016.15-423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,256.56,256.87,I was --
2016.15-423,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,256.87,259.095,I don't -- I don't quite understand that.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,281.535,287.07,"True, but -- true, but -- inasmuch as immunity is at stake, it -- it could be appealed."
2016.15-423,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,299.53,299.78,"Well, no."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,334.85,346.245,"So two responses, Your Honor. The first is, with respect to that last point, the questions that the Court has to decide are the questions that the sovereign asks it to decide."
2016.15-423,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,353.31,361.005,"But what is the basis for that? They're just -- you may waive immunity, but is there a statutory provision that supports what you just said?"
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,361.005,361.57,Yes.
2016.15-423,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,362.06,363.685,And what does it say?
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,363.685,370.465,It says that a court must decide whether the sovereign is not entitled to immunity before jurisdiction can lie.
2016.15-423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.93,372.14,Wait.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,374.77,378.4,"In the last provision of Section 1330A, that place."
2016.15-423,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,378.4,382.35,"Well, the section -- I mean, the question here is -- that seems right."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,432.955,438.335,"Justice Kagan, I think the -- I think the answer has to do with that phrase ""are in issue"" that you've focused on."
2016.15-423,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,452.97,462.7,"Well, what -- what is left to be in issue, if you've already decided that there is a right on property and it has -- and that it has been taken in violation of international law?"
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,462.7,474.67,"With respect to a claim against a sovereign under that particular expropriation provision, depending on the nature of the claim, if it's grounded in a common law claim, there could be other defenses that could be raised."
2016.15-423,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,498.345,502.785,I think I'm just -- I'm just missing what -- and maybe I'm just missing it.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,529.355,530.18,So two things.
2016.15-423,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,548.87,561.1,"Would it be -- would it be meaningful to say that when a Bivens action is filed with jurisdiction predicated on the arising under statute, a constitutional right is in issue?"
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,561.1,574.385,"It would certainly be reasonable to say that in the abstract, but here's -- here's the problem with -- with engaging too much on, I think, ""are in issue."" We have explained why the right must presently be in issue."
2016.15-423,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,600.42,609.41,"Well, this is a curious argument for you to be raising, because your prime -- your lead argument is that the text indisputably supports your position, is it not?"
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,609.41,612.25,Our lead argument certainly depends on the text.
2016.15-423,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,613.43,616.695,You just -- you just said we shouldn't pay that much attention to what the text says.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,616.695,619.41,"Our text is not our only anchor, is my point."
2016.15-423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,642.14,648.99,"So how does it work with diversity? We have a complaint; Petitioner or plaintiff, I'm from Kentucky."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,663.065,669.41,"The judge in a diversity case will look outside the pleading in that particular instance, take evidence as to whether or not --"
2016.15-423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,669.41,669.5,When?
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,669.5,671.5,-- that defendant is or is not from -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.65,672.15,When?
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,672.15,672.91,At the beginning.
2016.15-423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.02,674.25,Okay.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,674.61,674.88,Under 12(b)(1).
2016.15-423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.88,677.125,-- that's to determine if there is jurisdiction?
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,677.125,677.91,Correct.
2016.15-423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,677.91,679.735,And you're saying that should be the same here?
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,679.735,698.385,"I'm saying that it should be the same here, both with respect to the claim we're bringing right now, which is to the legal sufficiency of the complaint: Did that parent company have a right? Was that Venezuelan subsidiary's company right taken in violation of international law? That sufficiency of the pleading jurisdictional challenge is quintessentially --"
2016.15-423,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,698.385,705.97,Your response to Justice Breyer suggests that it's not only a question of legal sufficiency -- and I think that the government specifically says this in its brief --
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,705.97,706.235,Yeah.
2016.15-423,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,706.235,712.7,-- that you would also have a factual -- any factual disputes addressed at that time.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,727.25,728.14,We would indeed.
2016.15-423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.48,745.64,Okay.
2016.15-423,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,746.03,748.445,So I'm going to ask you -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-423,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,748.445,750.15,Justice Breyer.
2016.15-423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,750.15,758.405,"Well, I was thinking, I can't get my hands around this case, or my mind around it, because it -- it seems to me it's really about a practical matter."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,812.15,835.26,"I think that the reason that the practical advice might not be enough is -- is another response to a question that Justice Alito posed to me earlier, which is for purposes of the FSIA, there is a significant difference between a court exercising its power over a foreign sovereign, which is the nature of subject matter jurisdiction, and deciding whether it can exercise that power over foreign sovereign."
2016.15-423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.26,838.195,What if the Court has to decide whether it has jurisdiction?
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,838.195,839.14,It does indeed.
2016.15-423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,860.02,889.67,"It just seems a little bit like an academic exercise to me for the following reason: It appears to me -- and you're going to have to correct me if I'm wrong -- that on the legal question, the sufficiency of the complaint, that the district court said, and the court of appeals approved the finding, that there was a sufficient allegations of fact to state a claim."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,898.83,903.225,"Justice Sotomayor, that -- that is correct in this respect."
2016.15-423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,952.51,952.72,I'm sorry.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,994.285,994.75,No.
2016.15-423,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,994.75,997.24,Because we haven't granted cert on a legal question.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,997.24,999.39,"I -- I agree with that, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1031.68,1040.745,"Under the low Bell v. Hood standard, as far as I know, and I think they would be -- bears this out, it's not just 1331."
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,1079.54,1089.76,"But Justice Ginsburg, the solution, when it comes to preserving that foreign sovereign's dignity, is not to dilute the FSIA's jurisdictional standard."
2016.15-423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1093.03,1094.88,The question is what is the standard?
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,1094.88,1095.75,The standard is --
2016.15-423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1095.75,1100.215,Is it the standard that is -- is not this peculiar to 1331.
2016.15-423,0,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,1108.5,1120.36,"But the standard is the standard that this Court articulated in Verlinden, which is that you look at the substantive jurisdictional standards that are in the FSIA, and you decide whether or not they have been satisfied."
2016.15-423,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1137.625,1155.94,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg."
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1155.94,1175.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by talking about the way that we read the text of this provision, because I think it's a little bit different than the way that Petitioners read it, but not in a way that changes the bottom line in this case. So the statute says ""Rights and property taken in violation of international law are an issue."" What has to be an issue there are rights and property."
2016.15-423,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1186.79,1193.805,"And you think it's -- it's taken in violation of international law, and that's also a predicate for what's in issue; is that right?"
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1193.805,1204.54,"I don't think that ""in issue"" actually applies to ""taken in violation of international law."" I think that ""taken in violation of international law"" is describing and defining the kind of property that you have to be talking about in this case."
2016.15-423,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1204.54,1230.765,"Well, I guess the question is, though, what's left to be in issue? If you're right that the question of whether there is a right in property is decided at the jurisdictional stage, both law and fact, and if you are right that the question of whether that right in property has been taken in violation of international law is also decided, both law and fact, at the jurisdictional stage, then what is the issue, the in issue, that's left for the merits?"
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1230.765,1232.58,So I disagree with part of what you said.
2016.15-423,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1288.85,1290.63,I guess I'm not understanding the distinction.
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1303.775,1308.915,"In this case, I think the question mainly is the question about whether what's being asserted is a right in property."
2016.15-423,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1328.14,1330.56,And what's the question that would be answered at the merit stage?
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1330.56,1334.1,"The question that would be answered at the merit stage here, I don't think there actually would be much dispute on the merits."
2016.15-423,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1348.7,1349.62,"Yeah, but they --"
2016.15-423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.62,1352.25,"You're -- actually, I'm getting pushed the other way."
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1357.94,1359.11,"Oh, dear."
2016.15-423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1359.11,1377.555,"But this is what's really bothering me: It sounds, the more I hear you speak, that there isn't a good thing that we're going to write in this case that isn't going to get everybody good and mixed up, because it reminds me of a case where we set a kind of order of battle, as first you have to decide the jurisdiction, and then you decide this."
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1381.995,1382.63,"Well, also --"
2016.15-423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1382.63,1387.335,Because they tell us that cases differ a lot one from the other.
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1445.51,1455.01,"But in that circumstance, you are asserting jurisdiction over a foreign State based on a nonfrivolous allegation, and that is something that doesn't respect the foreign State's dignity --"
2016.15-423,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1455.01,1465.135,"Because you are, in fact, asserting jurisdiction over somebody who's from Guam. Because, in fact, you'd have to go into the birth conditions and all kinds of things."
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1469.15,1469.55,Understood.
2016.15-423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1478.17,1492.22,"But how often -- how often is that a serious concern? I mean, I understand that the reason you're concerned is that you don't want a reciprocal burden imposed on the United States when it's haled into court in a foreign country."
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1498.42,1501.86,It does make a difference to the foreign sovereign for the reason that I gave.
2016.15-423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1508.23,1511.63,But why is that? Why is that such a significant issue?
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1511.63,1521.63,"Well, as I said, there is something that is a real affront to a foreign sovereign, or can be an affront to a foreign sovereign if another court sits in judgment of something that foreign sovereign has done."
2016.15-423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1522.23,1525.49,"But it's going to be sitting -- it's going to be sitting in judgment, one way or another."
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1527.97,1528.38,Well --
2016.15-423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1528.38,1539.375,"I can't believe it makes a difference when the ambassador from whatever country calls home and says, well, I've got bad news, we're being sued in Federal court."
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1542.31,1547.52,"It does make a difference. And I think it's particularly sensitive with respect to the expropriation exception, actually."
2016.15-423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1554.49,1558.3,Is there a difference in expropriation and conversion?
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1558.3,1568.79,"Well, I do think it's an important point that here, the underlying cause of action could be conversion, if someone brought that kind of cause of auction which wouldn't overlap exactly with the jurisdictional determination here."
2016.15-423,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.9,1583.875,"Tell us when the government arrives at this position, because you know we have an amicus brief, people."
2016.15-423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.875,1587.88,Can you just finish? Expropriation is different because?
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1587.88,1595.565,Expropriation is different because this is a public act of a foreign sovereign taken in its own territory with respect to property in its own territory.
2016.15-423,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.48,1672.99,Jurisdiction in the case of Bank Markazi.
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1682.825,1685.34,There are real reciprocity concerns in this area.
2016.15-423,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1700.44,1700.87,Then can you --
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1700.87,1701.54,The question is --
2016.15-423,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.54,1706.675,Then can you -- I read the dark green brief.
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1723.53,1740.74,"I don't know that I can specify a date, but I think it has always been the government's position and the State Department's position that the actual requirements of the exceptions to immunity need to be satisfied at the threshold, as this court said in Verlinden; otherwise, the grant of immunity becomes much less meaningful to the foreign state."
2016.15-423,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1740.74,1741.24,I'm sorry.
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1745.045,1745.92,No.
2016.15-423,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1746.53,1758.545,"-- standard, or are you in agreement with the Petitioner that all of the factual disputes have to be decided? You seem to be saying no to the second."
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1758.545,1762.95,The factual disputes with respect to whether the property has been taken in violation of international law --
2016.15-423,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1762.95,1763.25,Exactly.
2016.15-423,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1763.25,1772.14,"-- if there are any, and if the foreign State chooses to raise those factual disputes, do need to be decided so that you can figure out whether you have the right kind of property in the case."
2016.15-423,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1772.14,1786.805,"Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Carroll."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1786.805,1795.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The jurisdictional test under the expropriation exception turns on what is, quote, ""in issue"" in the suit."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1856.73,1860.08,That's not the outset.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1869.535,1870.39,That's correct.
2016.15-423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1873.21,1877.98,Are you saying that immunity issues are not generally jurisdictional?
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1877.98,1880.04,"No, we are saying the opposite."
2016.15-423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1880.04,1882.12,"Immunity issues generally are jurisdictional, are they not?"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1882.12,1882.76,Exactly.
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1911.58,1914.02,"And you say that for the commercial nexus, right?"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1914.02,1914.55,Exactly.
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1915.55,1917.04,So what is the difference?
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1917.04,1923.37,The difference here is that other kinds of jurisdictional provisions don't require the establishment of a fact.
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1929.46,1934.59,"In other words, you're saying the commercial nexus language, you have to establish the fact early on --"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1934.59,1934.96,You have to -- yes.
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1934.96,1938.69,-- at the jurisdictional phrase because of the way that's written in the statute.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1938.69,1939.0,Yes.
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1939.65,1940.88,Because it doesn't have the language.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1940.88,1941.4,And -- correct.
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1963.965,1964.36,Right.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,1995.335,2004.91,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Petitioners and the government have cited no other sovereign immunity context in which the standard they are proposing applies."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.85,2021.76,So you're talking about the United States sovereign immunity --
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2021.76,2022.23,That --
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2022.23,2024.21,-- in -- in the United States courts?
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2024.21,2024.95,Exactly.
2016.15-423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2039.64,2044.02,Because there's extreme sensitivity with reference to suing foreign sovereigns.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2044.02,2053.215,"Well, I appreciate that question because I think it calls out the implications of the position being advanced by Petitioners and the United States."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2113.755,2114.16,I'm sorry.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2123.725,2155.795,"Well, from the -- from the perspective of protecting the dignity and comity of the foreign sovereign that has taken U.S.-owned property in violation of international law, to say that the first decision a court must make is to label the defendant, if the claim holds up, a -- a violator of international law before it can consider any other defenses that might not require that determination I think is not consonant with a view that protects the dignity of the sovereign defendant."
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2155.795,2182.065,"Ms. Carroll, I -- though I have a good deal of sympathy with the way you read the language, but it does seem to me it gets you into one big problem. So, you know, take a case where there is an arguable claim that there's been a violation of international law, so you would satisfy the Bell v. Hood standard, but then the actual claim that's being made is just a straight conversion claim."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2199.35,2225.39,"Well, I -- I think it probably can't be right, but the reason that it's not right has nothing to do with whether Bell applies. Under our view of this statute, Congress and the executive were reacting to a very specific set of problems, and they adopted a very specific solution. They were looking at the Cuban expropriations and other notorious expropriations of property that were affecting U.S. interests where sovereigns were using those expropriations to gain an unfair advantage in the commercial marketplace."
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2248.55,2249.7,"Do you -- sorry, I'm sorry."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2249.7,2250.675,Sorry.
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2263.61,2263.85,I see.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2266.22,2266.75,We do.
2016.15-423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.78,2287.67,"I don't know that that's a different issue, I think."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2301.855,2302.71,"Yes, with respect --"
2016.15-423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.71,2304.11,"Well, then why should it be any different here?"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2304.11,2307.95,Because this is not a jurisdictional fact like the citizenship of the parties. It's a --
2016.15-423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.95,2314.5,"Well, so what? I mean, the reason you do make that right at the beginning, I have always thought, was not a mystical thing."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2346.15,2353.47,"Justice Breyer, Rule 12(b)(6) exists for precisely that purpose, and nothing would have prevented these defendants from proceeding on --"
2016.15-423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2353.47,2353.73,Okay.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2355.72,2355.89,Yes.
2016.15-423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2355.89,2357.8,-- I'm not asking an argumentative question.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2362.9,2390.06,"I think probably the only significant difference it makes is the difference that Justice Alito referred to earlier, which is the implications of taking merits issues and calling them jurisdictional, and those implications are at least among the following: Number one, the arguments can't be weighed. Ms. Stetson is relying on a -- a version of the waiver doctrine that although we as plaintiffs in an FSIA case might be happy with, is not how courts have applied it and not how they've asserted it below."
2016.15-423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.72,2406.175,"Do we have to -- can we say that -- can we just say -- can we say, look, I guess we couldn't, but -- but I don't care whether it's 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6)"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2418.83,2425.32,But the consequence of calling it 12(b)(1) is that it is treated as a subject matter jurisdiction question.
2016.15-423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2437.315,2466.795,Let's go back to Justice Alito's question. Why I'm confused by this case is I think both the State Department and your adversary are upset that the court found that there was a viable legal argument that a parent could have property interests in the -- in the possessions of a subsidiary. Is that your understanding?
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2466.795,2472.28,"With respect, I -- well, I don't have an understanding about the motivations of why they are upset."
2016.15-423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2472.28,2472.605,I agree.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2472.605,2486.115,"But with respect -- with respect to what the dispute is in the case, what their legal challenge is to the parent's claim, is not about the character of the rights as rights in property."
2016.15-423,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2544.08,2571.585,"The basis of that, what do you think you would have to prove? That property was taken on the merits, property was taken in violation of a customary international law standard, or that having established that as the jurisdictional predicate, that there was a conversion under the law of whatever jurisdiction is chosen?"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2571.585,2585.75,"Our claim is a claim for a taking violation of international law, which has long recognized that expropriation must be compensated, they must be for a public purpose, and they cannot be arbitrary and discriminatory."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2589.54,2592.935,Property of a domestic citizen?
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2592.935,2610.17,"Our argument on that issue is that the Venezuelan incorporation of the subsidiary does not bar the claim in a situation where the foreign sovereign itself deemed that subsidiary to be a foreign company, treated it that way, and took its property on that purpose."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2634.22,2637.67,Took a close look at it? It was -- I thought it was under the Bell v. Hood standard.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2637.67,2649.92,"They -- they did apply Bell v. Hood, but I would submit that the analysis that the Court adopted, I think going back to Justice Sotomayor's earlier observation, was a -- a fairly robust determination."
2016.15-423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2650.16,2665.29,"And we did -- we -- we did say -- I forgot the name of the case -- that if there's a 12(b)(1) question and a 12(b)(6), and you think the 12(b)(6) is easy, you still have to decide the 12(b)(1) first."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2679.425,2684.98,"That's -- that's the holding of Your Honor's opinions for the Court in Sinochem and Rudolph, following up on Steel Co."
2016.15-423,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2714.37,2716.76,And if I could go back to Justice Breyer's question.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2731.725,2738.15,"So there's the waiver issue, which is the sort of the opportunity for the defendants to continually come up with new theories."
2016.15-423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2839.53,2847.425,"Well, it's always a little difficult for one party to tell the other party it doesn't really know its best interests, which is what you're saying."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2857.29,2859.75,I'm -- I'm sure that they don't.
2016.15-423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2896.28,2924.015,"What discovery would you need if they brought this as a 12(b)(6)? If they came in and said, there is no customary international property right of a parent in a subsidiary's property? What discovery would you be entitled to if they took -- if they brought a 12(b)(6) motion?"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2924.015,2935.34,"So I want to be clear about the discovery necessary under the commercial nexus requirements, and the discovery necessary to show a violation of international law."
2016.15-423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2935.34,2936.8,I'm asking a different question.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2946.22,2949.1,"Well, the defendants have never moved under Rule 12(b)(6)."
2016.15-423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2949.1,2949.73,I understand.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2949.73,2952.52,"So I'm not sure what arguments, specifically, they would make."
2016.15-423,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2954.735,2972.57,"It's the one that they proposed to the district court, which was whether H&P-IDC has standing to assert a taking in violation of international law on the issue of Venezuela's expropriation of H&-V's property."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,2972.57,2975.64,So that argument was framed as a legal argument.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3040.1,3064.76,"You mean under Petitioner's view, with the end results being either I have no jurisdiction, even though I just conducted this whole trial, or I have jurisdiction but it's jurisdiction only to rule for the plaintiff. A court under this position -- under their position can never find that it has jurisdiction to issue a merits -- a merits decision in the defendant's favor."
2016.15-423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3170.865,3175.565,What about Verlinden? They cite that many times.
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3175.565,3182.43,"They do, and I -- and I am happy for it, because I think Verlinden supports our position."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3255.33,3262.2,"And the -- if there's a dispute about the commercial nexus, that's decided at what stage? 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6)?"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3262.2,3269.28,"We believe that has to be decided at 12(b)(1) because it is a factual requirement just as, for example, a waiver requirement."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3290.6,3298.89,"Well, that's really all we're talking about here, and whether the -- the issues set forth in the statute are ones that should be decided at the early stage or not."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3311.005,3351.04,"To be clear, they are all jurisdictional requirements, and they must all be decided up front. The question is, what is the nature of the requirement in this language about what's in issue? Is a right in property is the taking in violation of international in issue? That is the type of jurisdiction requirement that is not a factual requirement in the sense of citizenship of the parties. It's more like the jurisdictional provisions that this Court has considered under the Sherman Act or the Exchange Act, which grants jurisdiction over violations, or the criminal laws which grant jurisdiction over offences, or --"
2016.15-423,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3351.04,3357.78,Does the issue of diversity or the issue of commercial nexus overlap with the merits of those claims?
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3357.78,3358.42,"No, they don't."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3369.125,3379.89,"Well, what if there's a dispute about the shareholder status of the rights and property issue? There may be rights and property, but we think you own only 49 percent of the shares."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3388.555,3392.87,That is a factual dispute that was -- would be part of the merit.
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.05,3400.95,"No, no, I know. It's a hypothetical."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3400.95,3413.72,"But if the argument is because of the amount of shares you own, you don't own enough to be able to succeed and be entitled to relief on the claim that you've alleged, that's a merits determination."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.72,3424.97,"Well, it's -- well, or it's a jurisdictional determination because you only have jurisdiction if you have rights and property, and you'd only have rights and property if you own 51 percent instead of 49 percent."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3428.91,3433.215,Because the statute doesn't say you must show you have rights and property.
2016.15-423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3470.445,3482.245,"So in your view, on the Chief Justice's hypothetical, before -- your view is they move under 12(b)(6) right away and they would say you aren't entitled to relief because you only own 49 percent?"
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3482.245,3482.73,Right.
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3484.82,3489.87,"Well, except that a lot of district judges don't like moving under 12(b)(6) right away."
2016.15-423,2,18598,catherine_ma_carroll,,3495.725,3514.535,"I'm -- I can't say that that's been an -- an issue in this case where there's been fair amount of agreement among the parties and the courts as to what order the issue should be decided in. The -- the petitioners here have asserted a challenge, a factual challenge to jurisdiction under the commercial nexus requirements."
2016.15-423,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3596.19,3601.05,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Stestman -- Ms. Stetson, you have a minute."
2016.15-423,3,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3601.05,3606.56,Ms. Carroll describes this case as a subject matter jurisdiction case like any other.
2016.15-423,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3685.89,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
