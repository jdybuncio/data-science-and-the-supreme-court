1960.115,0,19780,claude_pepper,,0.0,2.324,-- habitual offender of the statute.
1960.115,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,235.06,238.982,Thank you.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,238.982,239.833,Mr. Chief Justice --
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,239.833,242.645,Mr. Georgieff.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,242.645,244.744,-- may it please the Court.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,356.96,365.065,Do you think Betts versus Brady have to do with a man having a right to be represented by his own counsel?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,365.065,367.185,"No, sir, it did not."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,367.21,369.273,"Though -- well, that's what this case is, isn't it?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,369.273,373.392,"In -- in Betts versus Brady, as I understand it, was a question of denial of counsel, the appointment --"
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,373.392,373.841,That's right.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,373.841,374.132,-- of counsel.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,374.132,375.385,That's right.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,375.385,384.952,"I am -- it's true that I can't place it squarely within Betts versus Brady but I think, before I'm finished, I'll be able to equate it with the circumstances in that case."
1960.115,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,405.649,407.862,Where are they?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,407.862,415.464,"They were in reference to affidavits executed by the trial judge and by Mr. Laird, counsel in this case."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,520.355,524.163,"Well, doesn't that depend upon the statute of the particular State?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,532.879,533.806,"That is true, sir."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,535.274,535.867,He is not.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,535.867,535.963,He is not.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,535.963,537.519,"The Supreme Court has held that, hasn't it?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,537.519,538.287,"That's correct, sir."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,538.488,539.399,Yes.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,539.399,558.328,"-- I say, by the pronouncements of 775.09 and 775.11, we won't deal with 775.10 because that involves fourth offenders and it's not in issue here, but 775.09 provides, and 775.11, the procedure which follows when a man does commit a second felony and is proceeded against, that there shall not be an information drawn."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,817.184,821.808,Do you have a speedy -- speedy trial provision in your constitution?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,821.808,831.526,"Yes, we do, under 9 -- 915, Chapter 915 Florida statutes and Chapter 916, the first two sections thereof, sir."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,831.526,836.135,How do you equate this situation to that provision?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,836.135,837.725,I'm afraid I don't quite understand.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,837.725,858.855,"Well, here, you have -- have a situation where -- where a man has not been charged for two years or more, and after he has served his time for the offense, he was originally charged with, how -- how can you say that he has a speedy trial in this issue?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,858.855,862.404,"Well, sir, I have two remarks that I'd like to make in response to that."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,862.404,862.425,Yes.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,862.425,869.002,"First, the provisions for a speedy trial contemplate that it shall be for a crime."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,959.668,963.17,"But he's entitled to -- entitled to a jury trial, isn't he?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,963.17,963.882,In this situation?
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,963.882,964.198,Yes.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,964.198,965.014,"But of course, he is."
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,980.401,986.036,"Well, is everyone entitled to a jury trial on these multiple offender proceedings?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,986.036,988.425,"The statute so provides, Mr. Justice Whittaker."
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,988.425,992.782,I understood the statute to so provide if he denied identity.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,992.782,993.473,"That's true, sir."
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,993.473,995.338,"Well, then, that makes quite a difference, doesn't it?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,995.338,995.899,"Yes, it does."
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,995.923,998.076,Did this man deny identity?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,998.076,998.713,Did he deny it?
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,999.667,1003.041,What did he do?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1003.041,1026.082,"May I read from his petition, I am quoting off at page 5, â€œThe trial court then proceeded to read off to convictions from your petitioner's record,"" and then asked, ""You are guilty of these two convictions, are you not?"""
1960.115,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1038.231,1049.396,"Suppose the lawyer have a -- if he was present, he might see a whole nest of problem in statutes of this kind."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1049.396,1052.68,"Well, Mr. Justice Douglas, I was about to come into that area."
1960.115,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1054.514,1071.491,"Your -- your brief, apparently, goes on the -- which I read with interest is -- goes on the theory that, since he admitted that he was the man, and that's -- since he admitted that the two crimes have been committed, that there wasn't anything the lawyer could have done for him."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1071.491,1073.891,"Yes, sir, that is correct."
1960.115,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1097.777,1100.773,"Well, you've enumerated some of them, but there might even be others."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1100.773,1102.39,It is true there may be a host of them.
1960.115,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1102.39,1102.538,Yes.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1102.538,1103.495,No question on that.
1960.115,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1106.496,1116.501,"Well, one might be -- I don't know if there's anything to the ex post facto point or not but, at least, a lawyer -- some lawyers might think there was."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1116.501,1125.851,"The question of ex post facto, I think, though it may not have reached you and had a specific pronouncement from you, it has in Florida in the case of Cross versus State."
1960.115,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1125.851,1126.234,I understand.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1130.77,1136.244,"Yes and for purposes of illumination, do let me tell the Court that this statute is not new by any means."
1960.115,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1139.558,1142.275,I'm just thinking of the list of questions that --
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1142.275,1147.182,I'd be hard put to figure just what a man might urge if he were counsel in this case.
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1147.182,1158.647,"Would it have been open to, may I ask, to assert that, in fact, he was not a multiple offender in that a prior sentence was void?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1158.647,1161.782,I take it that that would be an available defense.
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1163.861,1165.929,Wouldn't a lawyer be able to help him on that?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1165.929,1170.239,"I'm satisfied that he could, if he could demonstrate that that were so."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1170.239,1180.673,"Suppose he -- suppose his defense was that one of these was not a felony in some States, for instance, the crime of forgery."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1196.287,1198.499,"That is the case in Florida, by the way, I might add."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1198.499,1199.145,Is that so?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1199.145,1199.206,"Yes, sir."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1199.206,1209.449,"Now, I -- I suppose when you're dealing with the laws of the various States of the union, that would -- that might be a very -- very obvious defense."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1209.449,1212.576,I would be less than honest if I said it wouldn't.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1299.37,1310.563,"Mr. Justice Whittaker read the statute in which it says that if he does not admit his identity, he's entitled to a jury trial."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1329.622,1331.514,On -- I have no doubt that he would be.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1331.514,1331.641,He would be.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1331.641,1333.136,I don't mean to suggest --
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1333.136,1333.259,Yes.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1333.259,1340.531,"-- for instance, that the Court would interpret this statute to mean that the only thing on which he could have a jury trial was a question of his identity, no, sir."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1340.531,1341.34,That's all I wanted to ask.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1341.34,1342.396,"No, sir."
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1451.678,1452.36,Mr. Georgieff --
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1452.36,1452.406,Yes.
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1452.406,1457.453,"(Voice Overlap) about three months after he served the sentence, he was picked up and this happened."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1457.453,1460.241,"Within a day or two, yes, sir."
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1460.241,1464.564,"Do you recognize any time in it all, after he'd completed the service of his sentence?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1464.564,1467.872,"Well, of course, my logic would be faulty if I said there were any limit."
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1467.872,1467.995,This might --
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1467.995,1468.767,I shouldn't make --
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1468.767,1471.302,-- this might actually then be years.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1471.302,1474.556,"To be sure, of course, it could, but then, so may many things."
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1477.175,1477.273,"No, but I gather --"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1477.273,1477.834,-- and say --
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1477.834,1481.589,"-- I gather, even if it were years, you recognize no constitutional difficulty."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1481.589,1494.648,"Since there doesn't seem to be, let -- I can only answer that, Mr. Justice Brennan, by saying, let us assume that a man has committed two felonies, not only in foreign jurisdiction but foreign countries."
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1500.978,1507.763,"Well, I'm speaking about this case, in this case with the very same court in which he had previously been convicted."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1507.763,1513.953,It might be a little more hard put to justify if the span covered is substantial number of years.
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1513.953,1516.333,It's hard to justify on constitutional grounds.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1516.333,1518.46,I think so.
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1534.992,1553.842,"Do you agree with -- do you agree, if I may ask, with Senator Pepper's conclusion that the power of the Court ended with the expiration of the term and the completion of the sentence served under that imposition?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1553.842,1555.254,"No, sir, I do not."
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1594.887,1602.14,"Yes, but in -- in this case, might that not be a state law question in this very case?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1602.14,1603.864,I don't think I quite understand.
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1603.864,1615.083,"Well, might that not still be something which the -- your Supreme Court might say is the way this statute is to be constituted, namely, that this Court had, in fact, in this circumstance, lost jurisdiction --"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1615.083,1615.104,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1615.104,1616.213,-- under your own statute?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1616.213,1617.217,"No question, that the --"
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.217,1618.676,"That's not foreclosed, is it?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1618.676,1619.604,"No, no question, of course, it's not."
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1619.604,1620.244,"Well, that --"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1620.244,1620.396,And they had to --
1960.115,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1620.396,1623.329,"-- a lawyer -- a lawyer might have been very useful to him to raise that question, is it not?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1623.329,1626.331,"Well, of course, he could have raised even that question."
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1759.496,1759.563,May I --
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1759.563,1775.853,"Are you saying -- are you saying, Mr. Georgieff, that the judge, in denying his request, made an estimate of the situation in which the prisoner found himself in?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1775.853,1776.887,"I must, of course, say that --"
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1776.887,1776.984,And -- and --
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1776.984,1777.906,-- or I cannot continue.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1777.906,1798.677,-- and that such an estimate was a justifiable estimate which didn't cut off any potential opportunities for the prisoner as against the inferences to be drawn of embarrassment to the administration of justice by granting this continuance.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1798.677,1801.195,"That's what the case gets down to, does it?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1801.195,1802.853,That is a capsule version.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1807.102,1808.102,"Well, what's lacking?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1808.102,1808.395,I beg your pardon?
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1808.395,1811.249,What isn't in the capsule?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1811.249,1818.683,"Well, let me go further and say that that is a narrowed down version that I won't argue with."
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1834.139,1835.109,He did what?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1835.109,1838.117,He secured credit for the time on his second felony.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1887.759,1890.219,"Well, we can't deal with a group of people here."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1893.6,1894.103,I quite understand.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1894.103,1896.433,(Voice Overlap) of circumstances.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1948.614,1954.642,I will agree that it is a considerable problem and you said it far better than I could serve.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1976.494,1976.504,What do you --
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1976.504,1977.281,I'm trying to think --
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1977.281,2004.31,"-- what do you say to the suggestion that -- that in light of the attitude of your Supreme Court in the later -- in the two later Cash cases, if this matter were remanded to that Court to be reexamined not only in the light of our pre-docket case but what they reveal to be the -- their view of the law, you might have a different result."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2004.31,2005.139,Without doing --
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2005.139,2014.128,"I don't mean as a matter of -- I don't mean as a matter of mercy or grace, but they've now laid down in 100 cases."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2049.784,2051.926,I'm begging the Justices' pardon.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2059.303,2060.091,Would be what?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2060.091,2065.536,"I say, an intelligent reply to that might offend either the Supreme Court of Florida or yourself and I don't want to do that."
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2065.536,2066.12,"Well, why?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2067.225,2067.58,"Well, I can't --"
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2067.58,2072.676,It's a question of -- I haven't read the opinion and I -- I assume you have.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2073.36,2074.33,I have.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2074.33,2074.804,Pardon me?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2074.804,2076.29,"I have read them, yes."
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2076.29,2083.172,"Well, then, you're able to tell whether Senator Pepper has put too optimistic an interpretation on the later Cash cases."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2086.36,2086.65,I do not think --
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2086.65,2087.013,If --
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2087.013,2089.259,"-- it is too optimistic, no."
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2089.259,2101.959,"Well, if that -- if -- if I may interpret that more pointedly by saying you think if judge -- that judge by those cases, they would have been -- he was entitled to have a lawyer."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2101.959,2104.878,"It is possible that they would, Your Honor."
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2104.878,2132.217,"Well, then, aren't you saying, in effect, that under the law, as we now have it declared by the highest court of Florida, a situation has arisen which makes a change in the outcome which may reasonably have made a -- may reasonably make a change if the case was sent back in the outcome of the case and therefore, there comes into play a well-known doctrine that an intervening event may change the course of the litigation."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2132.217,2134.852,I admit that as a very real possibility.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2136.932,2139.322,"No, no, no, that's -- that's --"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2139.322,2142.242,And that is the only reason that I made the remark which I did prior to it.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2142.242,2143.4,"Well, you answered --"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2143.4,2146.128,I anticipate that it's a very real possibility of course.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2150.029,2150.078,Nor can you --
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2150.078,2151.961,-- in the two Cash versus Culvert cases.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2151.961,2153.548,"No, anybody -- that's imprint."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2153.548,2162.506,"I read it quickly and thoroughly and I'm well acquainted with it and as a matter of fact, I felt err to Elijah McNeal which will probably result in something similar to it."
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2164.579,2164.822,If you --
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2164.822,2168.958,-- an educated guess would probably produce a yes reply to your question.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2168.958,2171.294,"Well, I didn't mean to elicit a prophecy from your argument."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2171.294,2171.627,Yes.
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2171.627,2194.595,"You've given the answers that seem to me vital to a judgment, namely, whether it is true, as a matter of fair interpretation of the latest pronouncement of the Supreme Court of Florida, that their pronouncements which, as it were, if acted upon this case, undercut the -- the unexpressed, inarticulate basis of this decision."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2194.595,2196.826,I think that would be fair.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2196.826,2225.37,"This -- this man is in jail and he's been in jail a long time, and he's properly here before this Court, don't you believe that, in view of those circumstances, he's entitled to a judgment of this Court without remanding it back to the Supreme Court of Florida for him to wait in jail maybe another year or two before he can have his case judged by this Court?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2225.37,2226.805,"No, sir, I don't."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2226.805,2230.363,You think that's equitable to do that?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2230.363,2236.497,You ask me did I think that he was entitled to a judgment of this Court rather than requiring that you send it back.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2236.497,2236.888,Yes.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2236.888,2240.803,I said I did not think so.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2242.003,2243.029,Yes.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2243.029,2258.547,"And, I said I did not think he was entitled to that without it being sent back because I'm satisfied that the ultimate disposition of this case will reveal that these circumstances are not as represented."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2258.547,2261.261,"And therefore, he is not entitled to a hearing?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2261.261,2262.696,He is entitled to a hearing.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2273.095,2274.227,"Well, I hadn't made any such --"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2274.227,2274.994,No.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2275.172,2275.921,-- suggestion.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2291.541,2300.17,"Unless that would preclude a showing that what his allegations portend is not true, then I say, of course, he is."
1960.115,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2306.469,2308.309,Are you --
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2308.309,2309.392,"No, go ahead."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2309.392,2312.59,"In other words, if I -- if I may go back to Elijah McNeal --"
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2312.59,2322.44,"Well, I'm a little confused because we're dealing with parables about what the -- what the Court will do and what it won't do and what it might do and so forth."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2344.227,2352.897,"Well, again, sir, I am put in the almost hopeless position of not having anything to urge in defense to his allegations."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2356.987,2358.23,"Well, that's why he's here."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2358.23,2363.045,"Yes, to be sure, because of the denial without request for return, etcetera, or a hearing."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2376.704,2382.223,"Yes, but your -- the major portion of your argument was that he wasn't entitled to any relief."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2382.223,2382.483,"Well, I must say --"
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2382.483,2387.172,But he wasn't even entitled to go back that -- then have a hearing now.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2389.332,2391.469,I did not quite allege that he was not entitled to it.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2398.633,2413.623,"Well, I understood you to say that he got everything in that Court that he was entitled to, that a lawyer couldn't have done him any good and that, therefore, he wasn't entitled to any remedy at our hands."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2418.084,2423.188,"Now, if I said that, Mr. Chief Justice, and I don't -- I don't have the time right now to go through it word for word --"
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2423.188,2423.976,"No, no, I don't want --"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2423.976,2424.524,-- and see --
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2424.524,2426.583,-- I don't want to argue with you of course.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2426.583,2450.276,"But do let me -- do let me say that my position very simply is, if this Court sees fit to grant this man some measure of relief or whatever measure of relief you think which he's entitled, I think that it would be unfair to allow this -- rather, to deny to the State of Florida the right to show that this man possibly may be lying about what he said."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2472.564,2477.659,"Well, do you contend that he is entitled to no relief."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2515.166,2517.189,"I think he is entitled to some relief, Your Honor."
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2517.189,2518.243,What relief would you think?
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2518.243,2543.296,"I think -- I think he is entitled to have a determination of the factual allegations that he made in his petition before the Florida Supreme Court in order to ascertain whether there is enough to them to put that Court in a position of requiring that testimony be taken to establish whether, in fact, these things occurred and if they did, as he suggests, then I'm satisfied that the Court will rule as you would if you had it."
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2543.296,2543.821,"Well, is that --"
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2543.821,2550.301,"In other words, your position is that he's entitled to the hearing that was denied him by the Florida courts."
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2550.301,2553.176,"Preceded by a return, yes, sir."
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2553.176,2557.899,"Which is the relief that was granted both in the Cash and in the McNeal cases, isn't it?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2557.899,2558.435,Precisely.
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2561.616,2563.576,"No, but that's the relief that this Court granted --"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2563.576,2563.642,That is correct.
1960.115,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2563.642,2564.785,"-- in both of the cases, isn't it?"
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2564.785,2565.402,That is correct.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2568.707,2570.188,Yes.
1960.115,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2570.188,2573.673,And it's my position that that is the relief to which he is entitled.
1960.115,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2583.755,2585.309,Thank you.
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2585.309,2586.114,"Your Honor, I think --"
1960.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2586.114,2586.146,Mr. Pepper.
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2586.146,2589.296,-- there's only a word or two more that -- that I've been asked.
1960.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2595.453,2597.658,"No, no, you have -- you have time."
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2597.658,2598.245,"Oh, thank you."
1960.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2598.245,2599.122,You go right ahead.
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2599.122,2600.254,Thank you.
1960.115,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2839.539,2839.656,I gather from --
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2839.656,2841.229,And the last --
1960.115,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2841.229,2842.01,"I beg your pardon, go on."
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2842.01,2844.189,"I'm sorry, sir."
1960.115,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2844.189,2850.369,I gather from you that you think the Florida Supreme Court finds a mandate from this Court helpful.
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2850.369,2851.283,I -- I find it so.
1960.115,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2972.038,2982.966,"Senator Pepper, is there anything -- just as a matter of curiosity, more than anything else, is there anything in this record to indicate what it was that motivated the apprehension of this man on this second offender --"
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2982.966,2983.33,"No, Your Honor."
1960.115,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2983.33,2984.503,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,2984.503,2985.543,The record is silent.
1960.115,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3016.12,3016.559,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,3016.559,3021.527,It's whether he was properly picked up or apprehended under our law.
1960.115,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3036.289,3038.526,Is this an unusual kind of a happenstance (Voice Overlap) --
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,3038.526,3040.267,"Well, it would seem to me so."
1960.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3209.722,3226.028,"Senator Pepper, on -- on behalf of the Court, I would like to express our appreciation to you for the very vigorous manner in which you have defended the rights of this indigent person."
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,3235.687,3235.846,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1960.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3235.846,3236.409,Mr. Georgieff --
1960.115,2,19780,claude_pepper,,3236.409,3237.6,It was a privilege to serve (Voice Overlap) --
1960.115,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3237.6,3249.683,"-- I want to say to you, sir, that we likewise appreciate the frank and able and diligent manner in which you have represented the interest of your State."
1960.115,3,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3249.683,3249.744,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
