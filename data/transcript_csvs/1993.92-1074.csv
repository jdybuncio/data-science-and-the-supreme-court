1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.48,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-1074, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. the Harris Trust and Savings Bank."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,12.879,15.902,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.024,143.325,The contract's what?
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,143.325,144.406,"Free funds, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.406,145.315,Free funds.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,145.315,146.136,Free funds.
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.385,175.426,"Or... well, that's not quite accurate."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,184.801,188.294,"No, I'm not sure I would agree with that formulation, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.294,194.468,"Well, what is in the free fund may not ultimately be used to provide benefits at all, right?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,194.837,195.398,That is correct.
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.22,201.232,"--So, it is not... it is clearly not providing guaranteed benefits."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,206.026,207.917,"--No, I don't agree with that, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.076,222.557,Guaranteed benefits?
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,222.557,224.409,"Not necessarily, no."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,245.613,248.185,"Let me ask you, if I may, a complementary question."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,261.713,271.73,"My view of it, Justice Souter, would be that if it's called an insurance contract, it would necessarily have guaranteed benefits of some sort."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,271.73,272.449,"At least within the meaning of the statute, yeah."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,272.449,274.241,"Within... well, yes, within the meaning of the statute."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,274.241,274.482,Yeah.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,282.216,282.547,No... no--
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,282.547,291.973,Because it will always be tagged onto... I mean it will always refer to a contract to which the disputed amounts are tagged on to some level of guaranteed benefit.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,291.973,294.364,"--No, I don't... I don't think that's correct, Justice Souter."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.399,320.291,So that would at least distinguish it from the argument that you're making here.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,321.332,322.783,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,322.783,334.031,And how would the statute be construed in the instance that you put where with free funds the insurer may purchase guaranteed benefits or variable benefits?
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,337.304,337.631,The result is--
1993.92-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.631,338.583,Does the exemption apply?
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,338.583,340.634,"--The... well, the result is the same."
1993.92-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,346.157,348.66,Does the insurer have the benefit of the (2)(b) exemption in the case that I put?
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,348.66,351.914,"--The (2)(b) exemption, referring to 401(2)(b)."
1993.92-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.914,352.471,Yes.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,352.471,355.994,I don't... I don't know that I would characterize it as an exemption.
1993.92-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.64,374.837,"So as long as one of the options is to purchase guaranteed benefits, that gives the company the safe harbor that it seeks here."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,374.837,377.979,"If... yes, if you want to use that term, that's correct."
1993.92-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,406.699,415.173,"Well, then all an insurance company needs to do to get the safe harbor, if we can call it that, is to just include guaranteed benefits as one of the options and it's home free."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,415.173,420.896,"Well, the insurance company, of course, is entering into a contract with a fiduciary, the plan trustee."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,432.604,447.393,"As a practical matter... I think you may already have answered this for me, Mr. Kristol, but as a practical matter do you know of any instances in which your company, at least, has issued a policy in these circumstances without providing for some guaranteed benefit option for the use of the free funds?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,447.393,456.45,"To the extent that I'm familiar with insurance contracts, meaning contracts that provide for guaranteed benefits, the answer, of course, is they provide somewhere--"
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,456.45,457.1,"By definition, you're saying, yeah."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,457.1,457.421,--Somewhere.
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.224,474.793,"But if we are going to... if we're going to follow the definition of insurance contract as you're using it and as we all assume the statute is using it, then... well, no, maybe I misunderstood your answer."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,502.421,510.967,"If the free funds portion was not available to use... to be used for additional guaranteed benefits, which is the situation you're positing."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,510.967,511.916,"Yeah, yeah."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,511.916,521.102,I would think that to that extent the contract... to that extent... the contract provides guaranteed benefits to the extent of the guaranteed benefits that have been purchased.
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,529.186,529.927,Okay.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,533.35,540.486,"I think for all practical purposes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a separate account contract, a variable annuity contract."
1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.499,567.144,"Does that mean... when you say a guaranteed benefit, that doesn't necessarily mean a fixed amount, does it?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,567.144,573.415,"It means, in the pension context, that the benefits payable to plan participants are fixed in amount by the plan."
1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.415,575.388,Fixed at a dollar amount.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,575.388,577.278,"Fixed at a monthly dollar amount typically, that's correct."
1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,577.589,581.512,And then the other half of the world is variable?
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,581.512,591.727,"--The other half of the world would be separate account contracts, some of which provide for variable annuities, and then there's a whole variety of other kinds of separate account products."
1993.92-1074,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,591.727,606.538,"Mr. Kristol, there's reference in the briefs to the period between '77 and '82 and what is the nature of the benefits paid between those years?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,609.72,612.121,"They were fixed but nonguaranteed, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,612.121,616.454,No question in your mind about that.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,616.454,618.194,That's correct.
1993.92-1074,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,658.981,665.536,But there's also comment to the effect that the decision below would wreak havoc.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,684.599,687.282,"No, Your Honor, it has not."
1993.92-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,709.196,713.047,Do we have any followup to that Peoria case?
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,722.223,724.976,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't know what the followup is."
1993.92-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,728.658,743.438,"Do I understand your position to be that this statute that Congress passed, that the meaning of it is essentially the same as if the Senate bill, which was very clear, had passed, that there's practically no difference?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,743.438,746.8,"I think, for all practical purposes, that's correct, it would not have any difference."
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.8,775.207,"Mr. Kristol, could I followup on the various hypotheticals that you... do I understand you to say that if there were guaranteed benefits and the free funds were to be used exclusively to provide contingent benefits... that is benefits the amount of which or even the existence of which would depend upon whether the free funds were available or not, you would still call that a guaranteed benefit plan?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,775.207,798.904,"Justice Scalia, I'm not sure I quite understand the example, but I think I can say plainly what I mean in relation to the statute, that if the contract provides that the entire book value of the contract can be applied by the plan trustee to provide guaranteed benefits which would be fixed guaranteed benefits, the contract in its entirety is a guaranteed benefit policy within the meaning of this section of ERISA."
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,798.904,800.005,"Now, take my hypothetical."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,825.912,830.075,That isn't a construct I'm aware of.
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.826,832.537,"Well, I know, I just made it up."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,846.565,848.946,--I hope I didn't leave that impression.
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.946,850.539,"Well, that's how... that's where you left me."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,850.539,857.681,"If the plan trustee has a right to provide additional guaranteed benefits, in our view the contract in its entirety is a guaranteed benefit."
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.681,857.942,That wasn't my hypothetical.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,859.233,861.605,You made reference to a guaranteed plan.
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.176,864.477,That's right.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,865.148,865.659,In your--
1993.92-1074,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.659,871.442,"--There will be these benefits and they pay the insurance company and the insurance company says, yes, for this amount of money we will provide those fixed benefits."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,882.67,885.762,"--Yes, that... that is a description of GAC 50."
1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.679,904.024,"Well, I thought... but doesn't... it depends on the option being in the hands of the plan trustee and not the insurance company, doesn't it?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,904.024,907.784,"The option would always be in the hands of the trustee, if there's an option."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.784,919.392,"But if there were no... if there were a case in which the only option for the use of the free funds, written right into the contract, was to provide variable annuities, then it would take it out of your... the rule that you're urging us to adopt here?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,919.392,919.653,No.
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,929.69,931.18,"No, I'm sorry, I just didn't state my point clearly enough."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,943.137,943.688,That is correct.
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,943.688,943.998,Okay.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,943.998,954.614,"And if the contract in part provided for the use... for that purpose and some portion of the free funds could not be used for guaranteed benefits under this contract, then to the extent that language would come into play."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,954.614,955.506,Then different result.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,965.353,965.954,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,965.954,971.117,So it's a hypothetical that State law prevents from being a reality.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,971.117,977.949,"Well, State law would require that if variable benefits were to be paid, variable annuity benefits, they would have to be paid out of a separate account."
1993.92-1074,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,977.949,983.793,"Under your interpretation of the statute, how do you treat the phrase ""to the extent""?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,984.825,985.786,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.261,1016.825,"I will be candid to say I don't understand why you're not reading ""to the extent that"" simply to mean if."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1030.973,1032.046,"No, that's not correct."
1993.92-1074,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1040.201,1058.753,"Oh, but all the funds may be available, but if the trust... if the person exercising the option may use all of those available free funds but chooses to use only a portion of them, you would have us adopt the rule of construction, as I understand it, that you say governs this case."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1058.753,1059.735,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.735,1068.941,"Of course, if the free funds under the contract could just be returned to the plan, the plan trustee use it as he would, he could always buy a guaranteed contract, couldn't he, if you're in the insurance business?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1068.941,1070.05,"If the... that is correct, Justice."
1993.92-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.332,1076.786,"So it wouldn't have to even mention the possibility of doing it, as long as the plan trustee had the power to buy insurance from you."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1076.786,1080.929,--To buy additional guaranteed benefits to the full extent of the contract's--
1993.92-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.929,1083.23,And that option would always be there because you're in the insurance business.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1083.23,1086.011,--If the plan took the money out of the contract?
1993.92-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.011,1086.402,Sure.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1091.024,1093.115,"Well, it's a negotiated price."
1993.92-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.115,1095.148,Would you explain one thing to me I have trouble understanding?
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1099.899,1100.2,No.
1993.92-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.275,1107.934,"But they're separately accounted for on the company books, are they?"
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1107.934,1115.04,--The PAF is merely a term that refers to the book value of the contract as reflected on the books of the company.
1993.92-1074,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.04,1119.334,"And that can be ascertained at any point in time, what the PAF is at a particular point in time."
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1119.334,1119.893,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1121.315,1122.965,I think there's nothing to reserve.
1993.92-1074,0,27405,howard_g_kristol,,1125.476,1126.107,--Thank you.
1993.92-1074,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.107,1127.289,"Now, Mr. Wright, we'll hear from you."
1993.92-1074,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1127.289,1140.997,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1074,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1185.145,1185.856,Mr. Kristol said more than that.
1993.92-1074,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1189.64,1199.384,"Well, there's one important exception which is illustrated in the 1978 advisory opinion that we've referenced, that's the College Retirement Equities Fund in New York."
1993.92-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.624,1301.062,"Mr. Wright, you said... as I heard you say it, you said that it does not constitute a guaranteed benefit policy if the free funds could be used to purchase variable annuities."
1993.92-1074,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1301.062,1302.882,"Well, let me phrase it another way."
1993.92-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.882,1309.277,"Now, I don't think that's... that is not what Mr. Kristol said, as I understood what he said."

1993.92-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.12,1313.861,That's what I want to test.
1993.92-1074,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1313.861,1315.621,"--Our agreements are greater here, certainly."
1993.92-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.517,1322.767,Right.
1993.92-1074,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1322.767,1325.769,"To the extent that they're available to provide variable benefits, they're not."
1993.92-1074,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.24,1329.62,"Well, wait... suppose--"
1993.92-1074,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1346.002,1348.753,--I think there are actually two very--
1993.92-1074,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.753,1354.066,"Under your test, that would not be a guaranteed benefit plan, but Mr. Kristol thinks it is a guaranteed benefit plan."
1993.92-1074,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1354.066,1361.512,"--I think there are actually two different very good hypotheticals here, and let me explain that both of them are different than what's going on in this case."
1993.92-1074,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1388.948,1392.001,"Well, what's the... what's the status before they decide what to do with the money?"
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,1700.313,1704.815,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1993.92-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1918.505,1921.587,They say they have the example of CREF having such a case.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,1921.587,1923.678,CREF is not even an insurance carrier.
1993.92-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1929.121,1932.754,They say that CREF came to them with a request for... to... a ruling.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,1932.754,1935.456,In 1978 after the enactment of ERISA.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.851,1961.603,Mr. Kill--
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,1961.603,1969.717,"In addition, except for that one example at the birth of ERISA and today it's illegal in all 50 States to sell variable annuities out of general accounts."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.061,1974.151,"--Mr. Kill, can I just clear up on factual."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,1980.255,1990.792,"The period between '68 and 1977, the only contractual arrangement was for the payment of nonguaranteed benefits... excuse me, payment of guaranteed benefits."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1991.253,1993.432,Could the '67... after the '67.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,1993.432,2007.684,"--After '68, although the conversion from a deferred annuity into a... what they call an IPG contract changed the relationship of the parties in that it became an investment contract and really not an insurance contract."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.684,2016.78,"But isn't it after the '68, or '67 amendment effective '68, that you acquired the right to have free funds generated that would not be used for guaranteed benefits?"
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2016.78,2023.663,"Between '68 and '6... and '77, when an employee retired he was entitled automatically to guaranteed benefits."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.263,2042.265,Would you agree that during the period between '68 and '77 they were within the safe harbor completely?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2042.265,2044.737,"No, Your Honor, I would not agree."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.529,2049.83,I know.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2051.862,2059.737,--The results during the period '68 to '77 was creating on an annual basis what Hancock call free funds and we call admitted excess.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.725,2103.986,"Well, let me ask the... try to get the question a little different."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2111.482,2118.044,"Well, one, I think... and that gets to the... sort of the havoc that was mentioned."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.064,2133.375,It seems to me you can answer my question with a date.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2139.59,2147.363,"Well, I do not think they have an obligation to create segregated funds."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.363,2147.754,Ever.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2147.754,2148.605,That's my difficulty.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.908,2155.829,Do you think the fiduciary can commingle the funds that are held for your benefit with its general funds?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2155.829,2157.651,"--Yes, as long as they segment."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.463,2177.434,But do you think accounting in the PA fund was an adequate compliance with their--
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2177.434,2178.015,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.015,2185.11,"--Do you think the accounting that they did provide in the PA fund, or whatever they called it, was an adequate compliance with their fiduciary obligations to you?"
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2185.11,2189.632,I think with seg... not the mere accounting function.
1993.92-1074,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2210.876,2212.256,That's a lot more than mere allocation.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2216.199,2218.881,--It is because they have different lines of business.
1993.92-1074,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2218.881,2224.134,And isn't... isn't that really what Justice Stevens was getting at when he was speaking of the need to segregate funds?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2224.134,2227.537,"It's a form of segregation, it's a form of segmentation."
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.537,2227.847,"Well, but it's not enough."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2258.908,2261.67,And that is exactly what they do through segmentation.
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.67,2265.601,Fund by fund or line of business by line of business?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2265.601,2270.165,"Contract by contract and line of business by line of business, assets are allocated."
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.645,2289.026,Well what do you mean when you say assets are allocated?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2289.026,2290.859,"They're tagged, identified."
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.859,2296.302,"Well, I mean a particular... say... supposing the John Hancock owns a building somewhere."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2301.755,2302.767,"It may be, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.767,2306.368,"And well... it may be, but that wouldn't necessarily be."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2306.368,2314.084,"It would be... it would be up to Hancock, as a fiduciary, to establish standards which comply with ERISA's prudent man rule."
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.597,2321.387,"Well, no, I was asking you about existing practice, not what would happen."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2325.19,2329.214,"They're... they are segmented, that is our understanding."
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.367,2336.608,Okay.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2338.821,2341.92,Segmenting means identifying particular assets.
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2341.92,2342.902,Like a building.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2342.902,2343.512,Like a building.
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.512,2344.582,And doing what with it?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2344.582,2351.507,And the income generated and expenses attributable to that asset are allocated to that line of business.
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.507,2352.428,To your fund?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2352.428,2353.25,To our fund.
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.25,2354.469,Your particular fund.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2354.469,2355.901,Eventually to our fund.
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.901,2356.34,Not eventually.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2358.503,2359.314,"Not... no, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.314,2359.602,They're not.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2359.602,2360.052,No.
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.052,2365.616,"No, just to a casualty line of business or the life line of business or the pension line of business."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2365.616,2376.675,"First to the pension line of the business and then through Hancock's investment generation method, which looks at the year in which contributions were made, it eventually is allocated to the particular contract."
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.675,2380.406,You mean a building will actually come to be allocated to some particular contract?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2380.406,2386.289,A real estate investment of any magnitude may very well be permissible with respect to one line of business--
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2386.289,2389.291,"Well you say very well be permissible, but I want the facts."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2392.734,2399.77,"--My understanding is... and I don't... do not know the specific investments, is that Hancock has separate investment standards and policies."
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.249,2417.411,But different funds may have different needs.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2452.333,2463.23,"Well, the Department of Labor, in interpreting ERISA, has authorized and approved pooled separate accounts, which is commingling the funds allocable to many many different plans."
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.363,2481.562,Without examining the funds at all.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2488.808,2496.662,"--Well, I think the... the Department of Labor, through its regulatory process, oversees exactly what fiduciaries are doing."
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.515,2564.316,"This language does not say ""provides""."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2565.808,2569.379,--Provides for benefits.
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.434,2576.305,"And it doesn't say ""provides benefits""."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2576.305,2581.517,"--The argument ""provide for"", first of all, was not even raised in the Second Circuit by John Hancock."
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2581.898,2586.261,"Well, we're here to do our best to interpret the statute correctly."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2586.261,2586.432,--I understand.
1993.92-1074,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.046,2687.558,"Well, now what bearing would that decision construing another statute have on this one?"
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2687.558,2696.453,"The ""provide for"" language is used by John Hancock and the Department of Labor to argue that as long as we have the option to buy."
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.621,2724.852,Mr. Kill--
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2724.852,2725.903,Hancock does not have any risk.
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.903,2735.911,"--I guess it would be... would have been quite impossible for this text to have read ""provides benefits"" rather that ""provides for benefits"", because the contract never provides benefits."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2750.16,2753.291,"It... ""provides for benefits"" means the standard annuity."
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2757.225,2759.174,"The contract never provides benefits, does it?"
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2759.174,2763.998,The contract with the carrier provides for a guarantee of benefits.
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.998,2764.238,Right.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2765.43,2767.019,It does not provide for benefits.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2839.258,2841.669,"Mr. Kill, the fact that the... the fact the guaranteed points aren't settled doesn't seem to me to necessarily answer it."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2857.63,2858.68,"--Well, that's the original."
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.331,2865.905,"--Yeah, but I'm saying in it's original form could not the price change and the amount you purchase change?"
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2865.905,2867.806,--In the original form there were prices set in the contract.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.806,2868.567,Forever?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2868.567,2869.857,Not forever.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.948,2873.569,And who changed it in 1973?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2874.611,2876.611,Hancock... Hancock has the right after 1973.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.611,2878.902,"And if the price goes too high, you'll just buy your insurance elsewhere."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2878.902,2881.964,We can't because we can't use the free funds to buy insurance elsewhere.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2881.964,2882.334,"No, no, no."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2894.343,2896.003,Absolutely not.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.305,2902.187,So the price... both the price and the quantity covered by the contract were variable even though it was within the safe harbor.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2902.187,2922.771,No what the... the difference is in that in 1974 Congress decided to enact ERISA to assist trustees such as this one from the abuses of an insurance carrier maintaining funds for its own purposes far in excess of the amount necessary for those guaranteed benefits.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.909,2937.49,"Well, interest rates were going up."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2939.062,2940.483,And we couldn't use the excess funds.
1993.92-1074,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.483,2941.654,You're not saying they're not entitled to make a profit?
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,2941.654,2942.576,They are entitled.
1993.92-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3097.776,3103.579,"Mr. Kristol, I think, had to say that Congress really didn't do anything different from what was in the Senate bill."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,3105.68,3116.048,"If that is so, we would lose because Mr. Kristol's interpretation is the enactment of a Senate bill immunizing general accounts as a category."
1993.92-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3116.048,3117.367,And that's what he says.
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,3156.014,3164.658,"Well, you know, there are at least four reasons why this Court should not grant deference to the Department of Labor."
1993.92-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3174.286,3177.067,"You're not claiming that the statute has a plain meaning, are you?"
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,3177.067,3178.739,"Yes, Your... yes, I am, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.967,3195.52,"You're saying that to the extent that plainly doesn't mean ""if""."
1993.92-1074,2,34680,lawrence_kill,,3195.52,3196.912,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1993.92-1074,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3202.943,3211.351,"And so it would be you taking on both the panel of the Third Circuit that didn't agree that the statute had that plain meaning, and the Department of Labor."
