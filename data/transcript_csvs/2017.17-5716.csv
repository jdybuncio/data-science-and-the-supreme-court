2017.17-5716,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.28,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-5716, Koons versus United States. Mr. Fisher."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,9.28,25.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In contrast to the case you just heard, the ""based upon"" question in this case turns on the -- how the substantial assistance provision, codified at 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(e), works."
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,84.4,96.12,"The problem really is that the guidelines are a little confusing. They talk about an initial guidelines range, and then they tell the court that the real guideline range is a statutory minimum."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,112.28,116.32,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, we don't think that's actually the way the guidelines are properly read."
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.12,119.68,Yes.
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,119.68,135.48,"And in that section, what it says is that if there's a statutorily required minimum sentence, then the judge shall adjust the guideline range to that minimum. But remember the whole point of a Section 3553(e) motion is to say that the minimum does not apply."
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,156.68,165.56,So that means the departure is not -- you're suggesting that the departure -- this is the -- the effect of your rule --
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,165.56,166.2,Right.
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.2,173.52,"-- the departure starts with the lower guideline range, and then the only way they can go is down from that?"
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,173.52,176.56,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor. But let me put this answer in context."
2017.17-5716,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,362.16,367.08,"Mr. Fisher, there's a -- there's an anomaly in the position you take."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,400.96,404.28,"Justice Ginsburg, we agree if that were true it would be odd."
2017.17-5716,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,449.76,451.2,What if the district --
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,451.2,451.72,And the government's --
2017.17-5716,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,451.72,464.48,What if the district judge specifically disavows any reliance on the guidelines? What if the district judge says I don't care if the guidelines are subsequently lowered; this is the sentence I'm imposing?
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,464.48,465.64,"Well, two things, Justice Alito."
2017.17-5716,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,477.36,479.12,"Well, they're not -- they're not mandatory any longer."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,479.12,480.12,Right.
2017.17-5716,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,487.0,488.32,"Yeah, so we are after Booker."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,490.88,502.44,"I think if the judge set the guidelines entirely aside and said I just flat out disagree with anything the guidelines say and I'm going to give you a certain sentence, maybe I'd have a difficult case on the ""based upon"" question."
2017.17-5716,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,511.12,518.72,"You'd have a difficult case if the judge says, I disagree with the guidelines, I'm basing my sentence on the Sentencing Reform Act."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,526.2,526.72,Fair enough.
2017.17-5716,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,526.72,528.44,-- that that's based on the guidelines?
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,528.44,528.96,Fair enough.
2017.17-5716,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,587.6,614.2,"What is the function of the -- the mandatory minimum? Because it seems the guidelines have Sentencing Commission, and that's fine, but mandatory minimum, like it or not, is legislation, and it seems to be vanishing in your approach. Instead of being -- instead of trump -- trumping whatever would be the guidelines, it's out of the picture."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,614.2,621.52,"Justice Ginsburg, of course, the -- a mandatory minimum in a statute trumps the guidelines in every -- and in the ordinary situation."
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,688.76,711.84,"Mr. Fisher, let's start with that proposition. In my experience, district court judges use a lot of different approaches to sentencing, and I think that many of the surveys and amici brief that you have show that. There are judges who have fixed rules. Perhaps they should or shouldn't."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,744.28,746.76,"Well, I think for two reasons, Justice Sotomayor."
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,762.04,762.64,But it was the --
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,762.64,762.84,But if your --
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,762.84,763.64,-- guideline at the time.
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,763.64,764.72,"Well, if your --"
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,764.72,770.64,And -- and they have discretion to say I want to use the statutory minimum.
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,780.16,780.88,Right.
2017.17-5716,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,780.88,805.12,"Prosecutors by their own admission have gone in to judges and said, base it on the guidelines. So there are plenty of judges who -- who do depart based on the guidelines because they believe that they're more reflective of the seriousness of the crime and give them a better sense of how much of a departure they should or should not give."
2017.17-5716,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,811.96,812.24,Right.
2017.17-5716,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1014.2,1022.04,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1022.04,1035.04,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There was very little discussion in the last 20 minutes about anything that happened at these particular Petitioners' sentencings. The sentencing transcripts are entirely in the Joint Appendix."
2017.17-5716,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1105.68,1107.32,"Well, it is a sentencing range."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1124.8,1152.52,"And if they came before the court again today for full resentencing, even after Section 1B1.10(c), to which opposing counsel referenced, even after Section 1B1.10(c) were enacted, Section 1G1.1 would still require that the statutory minimum be their guideline sentence for purposes of Section 3553(a)(4)."
2017.17-5716,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1152.52,1159.44,"It misses the next step, which the guidelines say, if you substantially cooperate, the minimum is eliminated."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1159.44,1165.96,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, I don't think that's what the guidelines say, but I don't think the guidelines even could say that."
2017.17-5716,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.48,1306.12,"Well, then -- then what effect does the next sentence have?"
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1306.12,1323.04,"So what that sentence does, Your Honor, is it notes that the guidelines are going to guide the court's discretion, which is exactly what 5K1.1 does, and it's exactly what this Court recognized 5K1.1 does in its decision in Melendez, if you look at pages 128 to 129 and Note 10."
2017.17-5716,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1324.52,1326.16,But -- but all the guidelines?
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1326.16,1326.84,"Yes, in your --"
2017.17-5716,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1326.84,1329.24,Not -- not just 5K1.1.
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1337.92,1338.32,So there's a reason --
2017.17-5716,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1338.32,1341.4,Which suggests that all of the guidelines should be taken into account.
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1341.4,1346.28,"I -- I -- I do think this was effectively settled in Melendez, Your Honor, but addressed as a matter of first principles."
2017.17-5716,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1455.84,1477.88,"But one other point that I think Justice Sotomayor made earlier, that, in fact -- and, in fact, it's in one of the briefs -- that the district judges do take into account the guidelines when they grant -- when they determine how much time to include for substantial assistance."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1477.88,1500.68,"So, Your Honor, 11 -- all 11 courts of appeals that have directly addressed this question agree with our view of how substantial assistance sentencing works. They say the D.C. Circuit has said otherwise. I don't think that's correct. But I acknowledge, as Your Honor said and as we acknowledge in our brief, there are district courts that do this the way that Mr. Fisher just described."
2017.17-5716,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1563.32,1602.52,"Mr. Feigin, you're just answering the very question, which is, you're right, there's a lot of judges, and I don't know that that's an abuse of discretion. You're already saying it's not a gross abuse of discretion or otherwise you would be appealing. So you're not doing that. It seems to me that the guidelines don't help a judge in their words to determine how much of a departure is just right, and judges have to figure that out by having some basis of comparison with something. What if the -- because they give you five factors to consider."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1664.36,1674.76,"Well, Your Honor, let me say a few things about that. The first thing I would say is when I was referring to the kinds of abuses of discretion we would appeal, there's usually a substantive component to that."
2017.17-5716,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1682.96,1683.64,"Yeah, because --"
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1683.64,1684.4,"And, Your Honor, I -- I -- I think it's --"
2017.17-5716,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1684.4,1686.96,-- there's different ways to get to the same reduction.
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1686.96,1743.32,"And I think -- exactly. And even if the judge got there an impermissible way, we're not necessarily going to take an appeal just to vindicate an abstract principle of law, even though in 11 circuits, if we took that appeal, we'd win on procedural grounds because they agree with us about how these statutes should be read. Now, Your Honor, in the situation you described where a judge did perform the substantial assistance reduction a way we think is impermissible -- and in a second, I'd -- I'd like to get back to the reasons why we think it's impermissible, but I'd like to address your question directly -- we don't think Section 3852(c)(2) relief would be available because we don't think 3582(c)(2) requires a court to repeat the same mistake twice. That defendant already got a substantial benefit because the court was looking to an even lower range than the court should have looked to, and they don't need to get, and shouldn't in Congress's view, get the benefit again. There are two legal reasons why I think that is so under the statutes."
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1796.08,1796.76,I see that point.
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1838.84,1839.88,Well --
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1839.88,1848.68,"Because there's only one person who knows really what that was based upon, and that's the district judge who put the sentence."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1928.72,1929.76,Three points --
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.76,1935.28,"Now that's a very simple -- you see, it's -- it's a little complicated to say, but you see what I'm doing?"
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1935.28,1936.24,"Three points, Justice --"
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1936.24,1937.08,What's your response?
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1937.08,1937.36,-- Breyer.
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1962.72,1966.32,"No, your -- your -- your -- your -- I sometimes speak more broadly than I should."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1981.68,1982.36,Your Honor --
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.36,1983.84,I still have the same question.
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1983.84,2000.28,"-- and my basic -- my basic point is if the judge considered something the judge should not have considered, that is not a reason, and it -- particularly where it benefitted the defendant, that's not a reason for a 3582(c)(2) reduction. The second thing is, just to your instinct that these defendants should get their sentences lowered, if you consider other defendants --"
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.28,2017.84,"I'm not saying that. I'm saying send it back to the judge because he or she is the one who knows whether this was really significantly influenced by the guidelines or not, and, therefore, you can -- they -- the judge can impose the sentence he really wants to impose."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2017.84,2105.4,"Your Honor, even under that approach, the only ones you're going to be able to send back are the cases in which there was a statutory minimum and there was a 3553(e) motion, so you're going to wind up with a very strange scheme where -- where the Commission's judgment that the drug sentences are too high -- and I think the district court judge who is no friend to statutory minimums made this point -- said that it's a very strange scheme where the Commission's judgment that the drug sentences are too high is implemented only in the case of cooperators. Amendment 782 says nothing about cooperation or differentiating between two defendants subject to statutory minimums because one cooperated and one didn't. But let me get back to 3553(e) and why it doesn't instruct a court -- and I think it couldn't instruct a court -- to start with the below-minimum guideline range as the starting point for the departure, to reward a cooperator twice, once by treating him like he didn't commit a different crime, and the second time by giving him a substantial assistance departure, and I guess a third time on Petitioners' view by giving him a sentence reduction that has nothing to do with his cooperation. The reason it couldn't work that way is, although the guidelines are not mandatory now, and we understand that is a constitutional ruling, Congress implemented this against the backdrop of guidelines it believed were mandatory. Now imagine a case in which a defendant is subject to a 60-month statutory minimum and the judge thinks: You know, this defendant did provide substantial assistance, not a great deal, I'd probably give him a year off."
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.52,2169.44,"Yes, if you're -- you're right about that, but then the guidelines and policy statements, which is what it says, have all kinds of things in them, including negative things."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2209.32,2209.48,Well --
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.48,2215.6,"-- than giving ""based upon the guidelines and policy statements"" a pretty broad meaning."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2215.6,2219.0,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think I'm pointing the Court down the road to perdition here."
2017.17-5716,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.12,2222.0,Quite right.
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2222.0,2248.48,"-- of how substantial assistance sentencing should work, which, again, is the view of the 11 -- all 11 courts of appeals that have squarely addressed it. And under that view, we think it doesn't matter what the judge may have had in his mind. You can't -- as we've acknowledged when this was up for debate before the Sentencing Commission, you know, judges may have a lot of things in their minds, and some of them are permissible considerations and some of them are not, and I think we trust that district judges at the end of the day should have complied with the law."
2017.17-5716,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2263.36,2271.12,"Well, why -- why is that, Mr. Feigin? I -- I mean, this language speaks in terms of questions of historical fact."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2297.4,2303.04,"So, Your Honor, first of all, I -- I know you understand this, but we're now talking about a case that is not like this case."
2017.17-5716,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2311.64,2314.2,"That's true, but that's a different argument from the one you are making in general."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2314.2,2314.48,Yes.
2017.17-5716,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2314.8,2316.16,-- you started off by saying look at the transcript.
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2335.16,2337.04,"So there are -- there are a couple of reasons, Your Honor."
2017.17-5716,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2387.0,2392.68,"I guess I don't quite understand that just as a matter of language, something can be based on a legal error."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2392.68,2397.44,"Well, Your Honor, here, I think ""based on a sentencing range"" actually has a very specific meaning."
2017.17-5716,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2619.52,2622.84,There's one -- there's one small point I didn't quite understand.
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2654.48,2662.68,"I'm not sure that we could, Your Honor, because the Court made clear in Dillon it's not a complete resentencing. You essentially do everything the same way you did at the first sentencing and just substitute in the --"
2017.17-5716,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2662.68,2666.4,Is there any authority I could look to to see if there's this waiver?
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2666.4,2667.56,To -- a waiver of the --
2017.17-5716,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2667.56,2669.68,"Well, I mean, you said you have to preserve all these points."
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2670.2,2671.04,"Well, I was responding --"
2017.17-5716,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2671.04,2674.04,"-- do them on round 2, that you're barred on round 2?"
2017.17-5716,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2674.04,2677.8,So Dillon addresses the fact that this isn't a full resentencing proceeding.
2017.17-5716,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2835.16,2838.6,"Thank you, counsel. Thirteen minutes, Mr. Fisher."
2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2838.6,2840.16,Thank --
2017.17-5716,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2840.16,2846.48,"Mr. Fisher, make the following assumptions."
2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2932.24,2952.52,"So the answer to your question, where that would put my clients, Justice Sotomayor, would be that this Court should vacate the judgment and remand, as Justice Breyer suggested, for the district court to answer the question whether the guidelines had some magnetic pull or -- or influence on the ultimate sentence granted. And remember for three --"
2017.17-5716,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2952.52,2953.12,And why can't you tell --
2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2953.12,2953.92,"-- of them, it actually ended in --"
2017.17-5716,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2953.92,2957.0,-- why can't you tell that from reading the transcript?
2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2957.0,2976.68,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the transcript, if anything, suggests that it did because three of the defendants, three of the five defendants here, actually ended up with within guideline range sentences. And -- and for the only -- and for one of them that the judge deviated from that, Mr. Gutierrez, the judge actually said -- partly because he didn't think the guidelines properly measured the offense."

2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2997.08,2998.32,Right.
2017.17-5716,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3043.16,3043.68,That clearly --

2017.17-5716,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3044.32,3045.44,That -- that's what I said earlier --
2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3045.44,3045.68,Yes.

2017.17-5716,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3051.76,3052.84,And what are the factors you're weighing?
2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3052.84,3052.92,Right.
2017.17-5716,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3200.76,3201.56,Mr. Fisher --
2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3201.56,3202.2,-- reading of Melendez is --

2017.17-5716,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3239.2,3239.84,Right.
