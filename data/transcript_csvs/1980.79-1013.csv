1980.79-1013,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.115,"We'll hear arguments next in William Rubin v. United States, 79-1013."
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,50.783,55.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Honorable Court:"
1980.79-1013,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,580.761,592.735,"Well Mr. Bender, do you concede, however, that the literal language of the definition of sale in the '33 Act is broad enough to embrace a pledge transaction?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,592.735,597.722,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I personally do not."
1980.79-1013,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.664,640.568,"What does the word disposition include other than sale, if you're right?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,640.568,646.638,"--The word disposition, under the Webster's Dictionary, is such a broad thing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1013,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,738.148,745.819,"Which is the... the Solicitor General seems to rest, pivot his case more on the word sale than on the word dispose."
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,749.956,764.965,"--My learned brother also finds in the legislative history, a very distinct Congressional intention to include a pledge in the definition."
1980.79-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.505,855.623,"Question: Mr. Bender, that doesn't estop the Solicitor General from doing further research, does it?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,855.623,873.854,"No, it... it does not, Mr. Justice Stevens, and if that was the only area in which there might have been a difference, I would be hard put to say the legislative history is suspect."
1980.79-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.588,904.873,"Of course, as a practical matter, I suppose this issue will only come up in criminal cases?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,915.947,926.469,"Well, except that the, in the government's position... I mean, since these cases all come up, for example, Gentile, in the Court of Appeals, was on a criminal case."
1980.79-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.338,929.671,Are they?
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,929.671,938.194,"There are civil cases under 17(a)(1), and civil cases where, under 10(b)(5)."
1980.79-1013,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.694,1044.044,But that was a different Congress wasn't it?
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1044.044,1048.081,"It is... I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice Rehnquist?"
1980.79-1013,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.081,1051.95,"It was a different Congress, so one was 1933 and one was 1935."
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1051.95,1052.2,"Yes, you're absolutely right."
1980.79-1013,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1109.553,1118.158,"Well now, in the '33 Act definition, where it's defining sale, it says it"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1153.732,1162.136,"--Well as I said before, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Fifth and the Seventh Circuits seem to agree that it's broad enough."
1980.79-1013,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1408.995,1413.565,"But if it foreclosed on a default it would be an investor, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1413.565,1415.433,"It might very well, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1013,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1421.337,1435.931,"But when the transaction was initiated, it had to contemplate the risks, the investor-type risks; does not every bank do that with respect to collateral?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1435.931,1437.181,It certainly does.
1980.79-1013,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1474.472,1487.047,"The bank was induced to part with some of its funds, conditionally of course, but to part with some of its funds in reliance upon what was tendered to them, is that not so?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1487.047,1493.784,"That, I believe, is... would be normally so in the ordinary pledge case."
1980.79-1013,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1568.399,1572.22,Well it was interested in getting it's capital back.
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1572.22,1573.82,"--Well of course, I mean plus its capital."
1980.79-1013,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1595.168,1607.893,"Mr. Bender, this investor approach is somewhat impinged upon by the Court's decision in the United States against Naftalin, isn't it?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1615.914,1623.068,"If the government relies... Mr. Justice Blackmun, if the government relies substantially upon that, I think this case is totally inapposite."
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.265,1696.367,Well who owned the securities?
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1696.367,1697.051,--I'm sorry?
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1697.051,1699.835,Who owned the securities?
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1699.835,1700.001,The--
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1700.001,1708.589,"I'm not worried about the fact that if I own something I can spend it, and the owners of these securities couldn't spend them, could they?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1708.589,1710.557,--Some of these securities were rented?
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1710.557,1714.845,"I don't know, they were simply pledged?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1714.845,1715.478,"No, no."
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1719.297,1721.498,"But they were pledged, weren't they?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1721.498,1722.348,"Oh, absolutely."
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1722.348,1725.366,"Then they couldn't be sold by the owner, could they?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1725.366,1730.668,"Well there is, there's contradictory evidence to that extent."
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.235,1775.447,"I have great problems, I know the technicalities of the stocks, but the fact that he says Mr. Bank, I want to sell you $50,000 worth of stock, and says Mr. Bank, I want the $50,000 and I'll let you hold this stock."
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1777.482,1778.667,--Well--
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1778.667,1780.201,If it's the same stock.
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1780.201,1783.869,"--Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, you know, if--"
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.869,1786.671,"We're talking about fraud, now."
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1786.671,1787.439,"--Yes, if Congress--"
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1787.439,1790.391,"You're not talking about, you know, niceties."
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1790.391,1790.941,"--Yes, that's true."
1980.79-1013,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1806.348,1815.621,"Well I have great difficulty upholding, sanctioning and permitting to continue, frauds."
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1816.973,1819.591,"--Well I don't disagree with you, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1013,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1898.377,1908.816,"Mr. Bender, certainly under the recent Aaron case, the Court drew almost precisely the distinction to which you just made reference, is that not so?"
1980.79-1013,0,34103,louis_bender,,1908.816,1912.268,"That is correct; that is quite correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1980.79-1013,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.548,1933.883,Very well.
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1936.383,1949.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1013,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2274.903,2282.489,"Well if we have a literal statutory construction available, why do we look at legislative history?"
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2282.489,2292.797,"--It's completely unnecessary, Your Honor, if... unless the legislative history were to completely conflict with the plain meaning, the legislative history is merely icing on the cake."
1980.79-1013,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2368.864,2370.78,"Mr. Shapiro, may I interrupt you a minute?"
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2391.175,2395.745,The evil is fraud and the disposition of an interest in a security for value--
1980.79-1013,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2395.745,2403.065,Were the great banks of our country the members of the public who Congress intended to protect?
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2403.065,2404.501,--We believe that they clearly were.
1980.79-1013,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2410.155,2412.273,Was there any evidence that the bank needed this protection?
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2415.575,2430.133,"--Yes, as I hope... I hope to take this point up at some length, in the preamble to the '34 Act, Congress pointed out the deceptive and manipulative practices affecting securities interfered with bank evaluation of collateral pledged for loans."
1980.79-1013,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2435.37,2442.142,And yet the language of 10(b) is quite different from the language of this Act of '33; it's not as broad?
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2442.142,2447.944,"We agree that the definitional language in the two statutes can be distinguished, we don't disagree with that."
1980.79-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.187,2473.011,"Now that you've been interrupted, Mr. Shapiro, how do you respond to Mr. Bender's argument that it took the SEC a long time to realize that this language covered a pledge?"
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2473.011,2488.337,"--I would respond by saying that the first time that it came up which was 1958, the SEC filed an action to restrain the fraudulent pledges and it was affirmed by the Second Circuit, that was the first occasion that it arose and the Commission has taken that position ever since."
1980.79-1013,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.925,2500.329,Well you don't mean that there were no instances of the fraudulent pledges between 1933 and 1958?
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2500.329,2505.482,There were none that were... that I'm aware of that were brought to the Commission's attention.
1980.79-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2673.892,2677.36,"Mr. Shapiro, is that argument really critical to your position?"
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2704.745,2710.547,--That would present the question whether the fraud was in the disposition of the security for value.
1980.79-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.547,2718.386,"In connection with the sale of the security, it would be a fraud in connection with the pledge of the stock, it's all one ball of wax."
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2718.386,2723.373,"It's possible that that would... the language is in, rather than in connection with, Section 10(b) says"
1980.79-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.173,2725.741,"Oh, you're right, yes."
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2725.741,2727.008,--17(a) says
1980.79-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.22,2753.909,"Does there have to be a misrepresentation with respect to something such as the value or nature or ownership of the security itself, as part of the government's theory?"
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2753.909,2760.313,"--That would certainly be covered, and it may be that the statute reaches a bit beyond that, but--"
1980.79-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.313,2762.332,But you say we don't have to decide that in this case?
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2762.332,2766.384,"--we don't have to reach that here, since the fraud went directly to the value of these certificates."
1980.79-1013,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2779.793,2782.245,But do you take that argument seriously?
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2782.245,2785.28,"We don't take it terribly seriously, no."
1980.79-1013,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2882.611,2892.216,"Well even if they were of no importance to the federal government, if Congress is exercising its power to regulate interstate commerce and has made it a crime, isn't that the end of the story?"
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2892.216,2894.249,"I quite agree, Your Honor, I quite agree."
1980.79-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.203,2976.82,These are in 1975?
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2976.82,2977.672,"They are, Your Honor."
1980.79-1013,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2985.076,2990.646,"You surely wouldn't contend that the '33 and '34 Acts were primarily directed at the Mafia, would you?"
1980.79-1013,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2990.646,2991.915,No sir.
1980.79-1013,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3030.737,3031.921,"Thank you, gentlemen."
