1988.88-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.539,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-155, Texas v. Gregory Lee Johnson."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,14.074,19.312,"Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.464,153.064,Prevention of breach of the peace?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,153.064,158.552,"Yes, Your Honor, prevention as opposed to punishment for a breach of the peace."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.685,190.589,"Now, why does... why does the... why did the defendant's actions here destroy the symbol?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,201.731,213.372,"Your Honor, we believe that if a symbol over a period of time is ignored or abused that it can, in fact, lose its symbolic effect."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.372,214.339,I think not at all.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,246.926,249.295,"Your Honor, I'm forced to disagree with you."
1988.88-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.295,249.728,All right.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,249.728,272.827,"Because I believe that every desecration of the flag carried out in the manner that he did here... and certainly I don't think there can be any question that Mr. Johnson is a hard-core violator of this statute... if his actions in this case under the facts of this case do not constitute flag desecration, then I really am not quite certain what would constitute flag desecration."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.827,277.997,"They desecrate the flag indeed, but do they make it... do they destroy the symbol?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,298.978,304.215,Texas is not suggesting that we can insist on respect.
1988.88-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.891,324.36,"Well, in the sense you're arguing a minimal form of respect for the flag, aren't you?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,334.484,335.151,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,377.847,384.167,"Well, oh, over... over the years, over the centuries, the cross has been respected."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,392.772,394.056,"That's true, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,394.056,404.93,"So, it may be that you can protect symbols by public respect and by measures other than the imposition of the criminal law."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,404.93,417.238,"Your Honor, I don't believe, though, that a cross has quite the same character that the American flag does because there are many people in this nation who would not view a cross as a symbol."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.238,420.59,Even probably... probably maybe arguably less than the flag.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,424.809,429.295,"And this particular statute, Your Honor, would not go to that sort of a symbol."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.68,463.351,"Well, you begin by saying that it's a symbol and by acknowledging, at least in this part of your argument, that what the defendant did was speech, is that correct?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,463.351,465.853,--We are assuming that standard for purposes today.
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.853,466.286,All right.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,482.347,485.966,"To a certain extent, we have made that argument in our brief."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,508.564,509.864,What are the others?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,509.864,514.717,"The other state interest advanced Your Honor, is a prevention of a breach of the peace."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,514.717,516.001,That's the other state interest.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,516.001,516.587,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,516.587,522.657,"But I assume under this statute, of course, it's not just one flag, it's 51."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,522.657,526.959,51 flags or all 50 state flags plus the national flag?
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.395,532.28,"Well, this statute prohibits the desecration of a state flag as well."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,532.28,532.747,"Yes, it does."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.747,534.03,Of the Texas state flag?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,534.03,534.799,Yes.
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.799,538.917,And I assume if we upheld the statute in every other state it would have the same right?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,538.917,539.667,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,539.667,544.405,"So, your category for one flag is now expanded to 51."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,544.405,547.29,The statute does say a state or national flag.
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,558.764,563.901,"Could Texas prohibit the burning of copies of the Constitution, state or federal?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,563.901,564.518,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.518,568.27,That wouldn't be the same interest in the symbolism of that?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,568.27,571.822,"No, Your Honor, it would not be the same interest I don't believe."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.822,572.522,Why not?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,583.18,587.434,"There is legislation, Your Honor, which does establish the blue bonnet as the state flower."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.434,587.967,I thought so.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,587.967,590.15,It does not seek to protect it.
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.15,592.235,"Well, how do you pick out what to protect?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,600.507,609.597,"Your Honor, I think Texas in this area has made a judgment that certain items... and the statute itself is not limited to just the flag."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.053,619.769,I understand that.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,636.914,637.38,"No, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.116,639.816,Oh?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,639.816,640.568,Not at all.
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.713,662.648,"Well, one hardly desecrates it in order to honor it."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,671.188,678.943,"I don't think that it is exactly, Your Honor, because I think that there are other forms of conduct which are... equally prohibit... well, let me put it this way."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.761,687.013,But its motive... its motive... his motive will never be to honor the country.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,688.715,690.132,--Not necessarily.
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.132,695.886,Will you give me an example where one... somebody desecrates the flag in order to show that he agrees with the policies of the United States.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,698.588,701.607,I think it is possible--
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.607,702.09,Well--
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,702.09,710.129,--that an individual could choose to burn a flag as an honor for all the individuals who died in Vietnam.
1988.88-155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.507,729.726,"--They'll probably violate a federal statute while they're doing that, too."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,729.726,734.028,"Yes, Your Honor, there is a federal statute that does regulate flag desecration."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.148,740.398,Your statute would cover that example that you just gave?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,740.398,745.652,"Yes, it would, Your Honor, because it does not go to the motive of the actor."
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,773.319,774.738,"Well, actually, Ms. Drew--"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,774.738,775.088,Yes.
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,775.088,786.546,--I thought this statute only applied if the desecration were done in a way that the actor knows will offend one or more other people likely to discover it.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,786.546,787.296,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,787.296,790.748,"There is that little added requirement, is there not?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,790.748,791.367,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,791.367,803.007,And do you think that that added requirement survives analysis under this court's cases in Street and Grayned versus City of Rockford and so forth?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,803.007,804.424,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe it does."
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,804.424,805.107,And why?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,805.107,807.626,Believe I believe the import of that statute.
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,828.473,840.53,"Well, I thought that the court had held that it's firmly settled under the Constitution, that the public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of the hearers."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,840.53,841.465,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.465,846.101,And this statute seems to try to achieve exactly that.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,846.101,867.598,"I don't believe that it does, Your Honor, because I believe that the pivotal point is in a way how is the conduct effectuated, how is it done, not what an individual may be trying to say, not how onlookers perceive the action, not how the crowd reacts, but how is it done."
1988.88-155,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,881.59,887.994,"Ms. Drew, it's probably of no consequence, but is there anything in the record as to whether this flag was stolen?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,887.994,890.38,"Yes, Your Honor, as a matter of fact there is."
1988.88-155,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,928.655,932.023,But you would be making the same argument if he owned the flag?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,932.023,933.892,"Yes, Your Honor, we would be."
1988.88-155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.415,946.248,Was he prosecuted for stealing the flag?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,946.248,947.45,"No, Your Honor, he was not."
1988.88-155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.45,949.067,I wonder why not.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,949.067,953.771,"I believe, Your Honor, that problems were of proof there in that no one saw him actually take it."
1988.88-155,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,975.017,991.127,Isn't the real way of opposing this kind of action by this man to have a large crowd out waving other flags in opposition to his posture rather than putting him in jail?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,991.127,991.729,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,994.162,1014.775,"Well, if you were out in front of the building today, there are pseudo-demonstrators of one kind or another, and I'm merely saying isn't... wouldn't it be better policy to rather than have a criminal statute like this to have 500 people out waving flags and hooting him down, so to speak?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1014.775,1020.246,"Your Honor, I believe that legislatures act in categorical manners, and that--"
1988.88-155,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1020.246,1023.181,"Legislatures act the way they do, all right, no question."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1025.117,1031.704,--It is within their judgment to penalize behavior that they feel is offensive to society.
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.704,1033.638,But you gave that answer before.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1049.232,1052.284,That is one possibility that we have advanced to this court.
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1068.746,1076.983,Do you suppose Patrick Henry and any of the founding fathers ever showed disrespect to the Union Jack?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1076.983,1078.868,"Quite possibly, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1078.868,1088.44,You think they had in mind then in drafting the First Amendment that it should be a prosecutable offense?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1088.44,1094.344,"Of course, Your Honor, one has no way of knowing whether it would be or not."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.344,1101.367,"I think your response is that they were willing to go to jail, just as they were when they signed the declaration."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1104.902,1105.469,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.621,1109.487,That's right.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1117.56,1118.829,"Of course there is, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.829,1125.399,When it's... do you think... when you have an equally strong case for the flag of the State of Texas or the state flower.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1131.302,1132.719,"Texas, absolutely, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.538,1135.938,Are you serious in that answer?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1135.938,1136.706,"Yes, I am."
1988.88-155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.706,1140.158,That the Tex... that the Texas flower... and you could make the same kind of argument as for this flag?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1140.158,1143.36,"No, I don't think you could make the same kind of argument for the Texas flower."
1988.88-155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.393,1148.514,But you haven't really made an argument that there's anything unique about this symbol.
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1148.514,1149.83,"Well, Your Honor, I disagree."
1988.88-155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.584,1156.501,"Well, I mean, I've just... what I've heard this afternoon is all I'm saying."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1156.501,1172.295,"I think it's very clear that the flag is the manifestation, the visible manifestation of over 200 years of history in this nation, and that it has remained virtually unchanged in design."
1988.88-155,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1186.203,1194.226,"Well, suppose... suppose somebody burns an American flag with 48 stars on it."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1194.226,1196.328,"I believe that is reachable under this statute, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1196.328,1197.211,You believe what?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1197.211,1199.63,I do believe that that could be reached under this statute.
1988.88-155,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1205.267,1206.751,It would be just the same?
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1206.751,1208.469,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that it would be."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.469,1214.456,"But 47 wouldn't work because there was never a 47-star flag, is that... then you wouldn't reach it?"
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1214.456,1215.706,"That would depend, Your Honor, on--"
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.706,1218.824,"So, all you have to do is take one star out of a... out of the flag, ana it's okay."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1222.728,1227.547,"--That would depend, I believe, Your Honor, on how flag is defined."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.799,1259.318,"Now, that... so, you're saying 47 would be okay."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1260.687,1268.441,"If there were any question, I would think that it would be appropriate for a jury to resolve that question, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1407.596,1427.159,"I suppose you could have such a... if that theory alone is enough to support the statute, I suppose you could have such statutes for Stars of David and crosses and maybe... I don't know... Salman Rushdie's book or whatever, whatever might incite people you can... you can prevent such desecration."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1427.159,1436.848,"Your Honor, again, there are other sections of this statute where other items are protected, specifically public monuments, places of burial and worship."
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1448.673,1451.442,But that... but that's because it's public property--
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1451.442,1452.358,--True.
1988.88-155,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1452.358,1463.082,"--and unless you want to say that the flag is somehow public property of us all and ignore traditional distinctions of property, then your example just doesn't work."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1463.082,1465.784,"Your Honor, I believe that it does."
1988.88-155,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.461,1510.663,"If we say so, it becomes so."
1988.88-155,0,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,1520.219,1527.34,Many justices of this court have held that the flag is a national property.
1988.88-155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.144,1533.294,"Very well, Ms. Drew."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1538.564,1541.85,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.785,1650.071,"Mr. Kunstler, I... I... I think you're stretching her argument."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1662.529,1662.979,"Well, that's--"
1988.88-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.979,1673.702,"If... if you're doing it to honor the flag in your... in your crazy, mistaken fashion, but it... but it would obviously offend anyone else, then you would violate the statute."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1683.894,1692.148,"--I can understand that rationale, but in reading the reply brief, the reply brief said in essence we virtually take that out of the statute."
1988.88-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.762,1766.714,"I was just on the Court of Appeals, then, Mr. Kunstler."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1766.714,1767.331,--I understand.
1988.88-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.964,1770.23,"I may have been wrong, you know."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1775.201,1794.495,"In any event, we subscribe to that, of course, in our argument, and I think Justice O'Connor when she wrote Boos she said essentially, this justification, folks, is only on the content of the speech and the direct impact that speech has on its listeners."
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.105,1939.474,Mr.... maybe Mr. Rahdert would feel differently.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1940.342,1941.392,That may be true.
1988.88-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.878,1945.694,"He's waving a flag in the back, I think."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1955.101,1957.618,"Now, we're getting back to my argument."
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1984.888,1989.84,"Well, the facts of West... West Virginia versus Barnette were quite different from this."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1993.393,1998.778,"--And here, Chief Justice, you're asking... people are required not to do something."
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.778,1999.162,Yes.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1999.162,2001.447,And I think that's a comparable situation.
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.105,2015.724,"Well, to me they're quite different."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2023.596,2032.119,"Well, you know, I understand that, but I think that you get into Street, I thought, which also relied on Barnette."
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.141,2044.243,And what was the holding of the court in Street?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2044.243,2058.753,"Well, in Street essentially the court indicated that you couldn't tell whether it was speech or whether it was flag burning and, therefore, the court reversed in the Street case."
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.471,2112.971,Well--
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2112.971,2114.34,"I don't know if I've convinced you, but--"
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.34,2115.905,"--Well, you may have convinced others."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2124.078,2124.945,--I certainly do.
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.945,2133.984,"--from New Hampshire where we said you can't... New Hampshire can't require you to carry around on your license plate the expression ""Live free or die""."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2146.709,2150.179,"No, but I think in Wooley, as I recall it, they painted out."
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.855,2174.628,"And the court said no, you... you... you can't pro... you can't prohibit that sort of thing, but the... the reasoning of the Court was that you can't require someone to make an affirmation."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2185.852,2186.302,I know.
1988.88-155,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2257.032,2260.167,Does the Supreme Court have a flag?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2260.167,2260.85,What was that?
1988.88-155,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2260.85,2262.936,Does the Supreme Court have a flag?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2262.936,2265.054,"I don't know, but the Republican Party has one--"
1988.88-155,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.068,2316.802,Are we going to get back--
1988.88-155,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.802,2318.336,--Exemption one applies to all weather flags.
1988.88-155,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2318.336,2319.736,Are we going to get back to this case?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2319.736,2320.538,That's in all weather flags.
1988.88-155,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.359,2328.125,"Mr. Kunstler, are you going to get back to the case?"
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2328.125,2329.227,"Yes, I'm getting back to the case."
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.002,2352.843,"Mr. Kunstler, let me ask you... and maybe this gets a little bit away from the case... do you think there is any public interest at all in any of these regulatory measures about don't display the flag in the rain or don't fly it upside down or so?"
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2355.879,2359.997,"--I don't know, but I don't think it matters because they're not criminal statutes."
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.051,2367.518,Do--
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2367.518,2367.853,They're recommendations.
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2369.237,2375.257,--Do you think the federal government has any power at all to... to regulate how this flag is displayed in public places?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2375.257,2376.542,I don't believe so.
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2379.827,2380.793,There's no state interest whatsoever?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2380.793,2383.029,I don't see any state interest whatsoever.
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.029,2387.831,I feel quite differently.
1988.88-155,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2387.831,2394.568,Can the federal government prohibit use of the flag for commercial purposes?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2452.904,2397.77,I don't know.
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.84,2515.792,Let me go back to the any state interest at all.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2527.498,2527.983,You might have a case there.
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.983,2528.633,You might have a case.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2528.633,2535.22,"If a person that joins the army, the flag has maybe even a more peculiar significance to people in the army."
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2584.181,2589.251,I was only suggesting that maybe there is some... some identifiable state interest that's involved here.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2589.251,2589.801,--Yeah.
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.77,2591.253,I think you're acknowledging that there is.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2591.253,2593.403,--impression that I say it's totally out of reach.
1988.88-155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.588,2597.573,You did say that.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2597.573,2598.29,I know I did.
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.554,2660.563,"What about... what about Finer against New York, remember, where that fellow was speaking up at Syracuse and said President Truman is a champagne sipping bum, whereupon they told him he had to stop speaking because of fear from the crowd was going to attack him?"
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2660.563,2665.198,"--Well, I don't think that changes the position yet because it's no different than Terminiello, really."
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2666.633,2669.669,"Well, it came after Terminiello, and it went... it came out the other way."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2669.669,2676.573,"I know it, and apparently the imminence there was so imminent --"
1988.88-155,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2714.548,2718.233,"Well, then we come close to the Skokie cases."
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2718.233,2734.777,"Well, Skokie presents a situation, of course, where the attempt to parade through an all white community of black demonstrators... but even there, of course, you can't stop it."
1988.88-155,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2735.611,2736.827,That's my point.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2736.827,2746.419,"It you're going to stop it, it has to be so imminent as the Chief said... it has to be so imminent that it really reaches clear and present danger proportions."
1988.88-155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.131,2958.0,That's the Court's doctrine.
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2958.0,2958.967,--Pardon me.
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3067.886,3071.524,But he'd been charged with a number of different offenses here?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3071.524,3072.224,No.
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3076.226,3080.629,What did the case finally... what was he charged with when it was submitted to the jury?
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3080.629,3083.414,He was charged with... I have the charge here.
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3083.414,3088.818,"I don't mean the judge's charge, but the indictment or information, what offenses?"
1988.88-155,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3088.818,3091.251,"It's an information, a misdemeanor."
1988.88-155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3294.468,3295.786,"Thank you, Mr. Kunstler."
1988.88-155,2,33811,kathi_alyce_drew,,3301.357,3302.74,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.88-155,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3370.368,3371.118,"Thank you, Ms. Drew."
