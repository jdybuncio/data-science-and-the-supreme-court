1965.645,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,43.37,"Number 645, United States, Petitioner versus the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States."
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,44.679,48.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,583.876,584.061,Mr. Rifkind (Voice Overlap) --
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,584.061,585.448,-- in Pioneer's mortgage.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.826,590.759,Were there other allowances of tax costs in addition to the attorney's fee under this rule?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,590.759,596.467,"Yes, there were some 200 odd dollars of normal tax cost, court fees and so on."
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,596.467,601.563,And what's the Government's position as to that?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,601.563,619.273,The Government has never disputed that normal tax costs which are definite amount which are paid generally speaking to court officials as a toll for using the court have precedence over everything.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.273,624.808,"Are these -- are all this whole 200 and 80 odd dollars, are they definite?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,624.808,629.273,They are certainly as definite as things can be in the -- in life.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,652.798,668.461,And what is the distinction between the tax cost which the Government concedes as priority and this tax cost from the way of -- a fixed percentage for counsel fees?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,668.461,692.541,"Well, there is -- there's first of all the historical difference that we have always recognized or generally recognized in the United States, in this Court, throughout the states that there is a difference between counsel fees as cost which may or may not be allowable, generally are not, and the fees paid into court to clerks and so on for services provided by the court."
1965.645,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,739.195,739.269,"Well, entirely (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.645,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,739.269,740.193,Mr. Rifkind.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,740.193,742.693,-- matter in what way?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,742.693,743.322,I'm sorry?
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.322,745.337,Entirely different but I know that they set an entirely --
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,745.337,745.951,Yes.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,745.951,752.483,"-- different matter, but in what way are they an entirely different matter?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,752.483,760.085,That -- they took a much more restrictive view of the circumstances under which those might possibly be allowed.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,760.085,760.989,As tax costs?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,760.989,761.791,As tax costs.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,761.791,771.921,"As I understand it this rule specifies so that everyone knows in advance only as to those apply X percentage to some figure, doesn't he?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,773.807,779.025,"That's right, if you know the amount of the judgment to be allowed."
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,779.025,781.09,"Well, you can't know that until the sales end."
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,781.09,784.094,You can't know that until judgment.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,784.094,786.752,But you do know that it's going to be an X percent.
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,786.752,786.865,That's right.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,786.865,788.044,Fixed percentage of that -- right.
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,788.044,794.172,But certainly when the federal lien arose you didn't know what it was going to pay you.
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.874,803.381,"(Inaudible) it is really is rather hard on the principle to distinguish here, this cost from attorney's fees, isn't it Mr. Rifkind?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,803.381,828.24,"Except I think on the theory which in a way the Court adopted in Pioneer that there is a difference between something reimbursement for an amount paid into court or state court officers as a toll for judicial process, and something paid to your adversary for his lawyer who is representing him in an adverse relationship."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.24,835.165,"And as a matter of fact it's probably kind of harder to distinguish between this attorney's fees, isn't it, be in interest, isn't it?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,835.165,836.92,"No, I think not."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.942,839.499,"Well, how do you know how much or even the principal?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,847.932,856.329,"You certainly don't know at any time the dollar figure, but the crucial --"
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.329,856.779,"You mean, you don't (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,856.779,858.732,"That is when the federal lien arises, you don't get (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.732,863.858,"Do you think you know what the outside figure, is that it?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,863.858,875.28,"No, but the point is that the counsel fee problem is contingent and inchoate in a much more fundamental sense."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.079,907.061,"And do you take the same position on the other amounts that have -- under a mortgage that aren't either principal or interest but nevertheless is secured from the mortgage taxes, do you -- is that your position?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,907.061,909.966,With respect to taxes that the mortgagee might pay?
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.966,912.114,"Yes, if the mortgagee pays."
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,912.114,935.605,"Well, we've certainly taken the position consistently and the court has supported us in that view that if the mortgagee pays taxes after a federal lien arises and those taxes themselves, state taxes, would be junior to the federal lien that the recompense for the amounts paid out are not senior to the federal lien."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.605,938.238,How about insurance?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,938.238,942.866,Insurance presents a more difficult question.
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.486,950.752,(Inaudible) insurance?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,950.752,953.921,"Yes, if it's -- but the question is how much."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.862,973.779,"And so, (Voice Overlap) -- so you say the federal lien is a -- once it's filed is prior to any subsequent insurance payment."
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,973.779,977.056,"Any subsequent advances, that's right."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.485,981.9,And life insurance the same way?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,981.9,988.337,"I'm not sure I think of how life insurance would come into play, but I -- but the general rule is that --"
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.337,990.115,"Private insurance, its (Inaudible), are you?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,990.115,1007.856,"That all advances made subsequent to the falling in the -- or of the attachment of the federal lien have to be subordinate under the general rule, first in time is first in right."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.856,1013.013,"Well, how about the open-ended mortgage on -- for future advances with an outside limit placed on in the mortgage?"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1013.013,1026.601,The Court has taken the view in a long series of cases that a security for future advances does not give priority when those advances occur after the federal lien arises.
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.724,1030.402,This is because it's of inchoateness?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1030.402,1038.396,"Because of inchoateness, because -- well, in a sense there's a very practical problem here."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.965,1089.95,"Oh, but take the same position in this case that the attorney's fees was in a dollar amount, $150 for each attorney's fees."
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1089.95,1095.866,Specified in the mortgage or in the lien or in the rules?
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.866,1100.232,"Or right in the mortgage, yes, $150 of attorney's fee."
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1100.232,1114.305,"It still remains the fact that at the time the federal lien attached there was no reason to believe at all that foreclosure would take place, the default would take place."
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.305,1114.579,That's (Voice Overlap) --
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1114.579,1116.353,That was a remote contingency.
1965.645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.353,1119.832,That's the same with regard to the principal.
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1119.832,1127.738,"But until default -- until the Equitable has to go into court, it doesn't incur a liability."
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1134.209,1134.245,"Well, I would say --"
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1134.245,1135.635,It's that --
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1135.635,1139.936,-- liability for cost apart from counsel fee.
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1139.936,1140.821,"I'm sorry, I didn't --"
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1140.821,1144.599,The liability for costs which you concede --
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1144.599,1145.177,That's right.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1145.177,1152.695,-- are prior to the Government lien are not incurred either until Equitable went into court
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1152.695,1152.855,Perhaps --
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1152.855,1159.098,"And at the time of the lien, I gather on the facts of this case, there wasn't any suggestion of a default."
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1160.174,1161.174,"That's certainly true, and --"
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1161.174,1174.506,"So, that -- is that -- that all these -- that's why I have trouble understanding what on principal how you distinguish those costs that you concede superior to the Government lien under this case."
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1174.506,1176.731,"Well, perhaps there is an inconsistency."
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1176.731,1177.571,Perhaps what?
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1177.571,1180.109,Perhaps there is an inconsistency.
1965.645,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1180.109,1180.869,Perhaps?
1965.645,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1180.869,1182.877,Mr. Rifkind --
1965.645,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1182.877,1187.844,"But there has been -- there is the feeling that these are small, they're de minimis."
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,1599.589,1600.956,Your Honors.
1965.645,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2035.591,2041.427,"Well, those counsel fees are less than the statute provides, isn't that right?"
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2048.456,2048.601,They were --
1965.645,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2048.601,2049.179,In your state (Voice Overlap) --
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2049.179,2052.862,-- 1 1/2 to 2 1/4% of the principal balance.
1965.645,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2069.742,2078.945,"I'm sorry, just to clear this up for me, you are saying that your study did not disclose its fee, counsel less than the statutory --"
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2078.945,2080.297,No sir.
1965.645,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2084.96,2105.924,"Mr. Hoak, does your case depend on the distinction that we might make between statutes that provide reasonable attorney's fees on the one hand and a statute on the other hand that provides for a percentage of the amount due?"
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2105.924,2107.948,"Yes sir, I think that the --"
1965.645,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2107.948,2110.745,That you'll -- it depends upon that issue that (Voice Overlap) --
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2110.745,2111.351,Yes sir.
1965.645,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2111.351,2112.139,Yes.
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2112.139,2118.833,There must be a -- an objective standard by which to measure a competing lien.
1965.645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.621,2210.634,I take it you are somewhat dissatisfied with the whole choateness concept however as applied to mortgages.
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2210.634,2212.564,"As applied to mortgages, yes sir Your Honor."
1965.645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.615,2258.334,What do you do in New Jersey with regard to a second mortgagee?
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2285.934,2287.658,That is not the rule in New Jersey.
1965.645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.026,2315.593,"The rule is otherwise some other places, you know (Inaudible) -- but how about the -- how about future advances as against the second mortgagee?"
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2315.593,2321.75,"We are entitled to -- well, when we get into the question of future advances that --"
1965.645,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.75,2322.987,I don't want to take all your time on it.
1965.645,1,24105,frank_w_hoak,,2322.987,2332.278,There is a distinction I think sometimes made between whether there's a legal liability to make the advance or not.
1965.645,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2377.013,2381.81,Mr. Rifkind.
1965.645,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2381.81,2388.866,"Mr. Chief Justice, I just like to make one or two very short points."
1965.645,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2634.608,2635.165,Very well.
