1977.77-677,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,63.737,We will hear arguments next in Owen Equipment against Kroger.
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,66.118,71.138,"Mr. Chief Justice and if it pleases the Court, gentlemen."
1977.77-677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.65,141.254,"When you say excused from the proceedings, you mean the original defendant move for summary judgment?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,141.254,142.564,He moved for a summary judgment.
1977.77-677,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,162.117,165.436,"So at that stage, you had what parties?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,165.436,177.857,"At that stage, after that original defendant was excused and I use that word appropriately I think, dismissed perhaps is a better word, Your Honor, dismissed from the suit."
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,195.863,197.589,That was an amended complaint?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,197.589,202.17,"Yes sir, Your Honor that was on the basis of an amended complaint."
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.16,288.197,To that extent the employer defendant would have had more in common with the plaintiffs than with the defendant?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,288.197,309.554,"That is right Your Honor and it was for that reason as I say that the trial judge, judge Denny realigned that party and in effect made the Paxton Vierling Company which was an employer, a party claimant for the purpose of retaining jurisdiction of the case and as you say, their interests were in fact aligned."
1977.77-677,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,309.554,312.614,That is a new lawsuit then?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,312.614,317.367,It was really part of the original lawsuit as was treated in this case.
1977.77-677,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,320.765,324.982,You realigned them because you lost the regular party?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,324.982,325.829,That is right.
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,420.644,423.231,Same state as the original plaintiff?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,423.231,425.624,As the original plaintiff or the original defendant.
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,425.624,435.114,"If the original defendant, there is no problem because presumably the original plaintiff and the original defendant were of diverse citizenship."
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,447.868,449.065,"Yes, and I see no problem with that."
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,449.065,450.492,"That is permissible, that is established."
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,450.492,464.576,"I see no problem with that, but the problem that arises here, Justice Stewart is in that, the plaintiff in this case was permitted to file a direct claim, do you not see against that third party defendant."
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.408,504.425,"Mr. Sodoro, let me just get one thing straight."
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,509.905,512.659,"In part, but not necessarily."
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.431,557.131,"How is that any different in practical effect between A suing B and B having a cross claim against C and then everything is all done, C pays B and B pays A?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,558.967,561.233,It has a substantial effect.
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.956,574.077,Then there would be no jurisdiction?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,574.077,576.854,There would be no jurisdiction in the Federal Court.
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,588.195,597.985,"On the pleadings though initially, this appeared to be a suit by a resident of Iowa against a Nebraskan Corporation, your client, am I right or not?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,597.985,598.491,"Yes, sir Justice Brennan."
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,598.491,610.384,It was not until the trial was almost over that it was introduced the fact that actually the Nebraskan corporation had its principal place of business in Iowa?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,610.384,613.47,"On the record, that is generally an exact statement."
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,613.47,614.701,"That is what has happened, is it not?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,614.701,615.985,Not exactly.
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,618.04,627.715,"When did the fact that the Nebraska corporation had its principal place of business in Iowa, when was that revealed to the Court?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,627.715,632.046,That was revealed when you say to the Court --
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,632.046,633.638,Or to the parties for that matter?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,633.638,634.201,To the parties.
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,644.336,646.006,When did the trial start?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,646.006,651.901,The trial commenced Your Honor on the 12th day of January 1976.
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.384,703.534,"Carter Lake, Iowa is on the west side of the Missouri river, is it not?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,703.534,704.685,"Yes it is, Your Honor."
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,704.685,710.45,Does it have kind of a nubbin sticking into the city of Omaha?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,710.45,716.027,Your description generally is accurate except that it is not a nubbin that is part of the city of Omaha.
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,718.338,719.176,Near the airport?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,719.176,760.687,"Out near the airport, exactly and what you have there is when the states were originally divided by the Missouri river, there was a bend in the river and that bend in the river somehow (Inaudible) to the east and there is a piece of land despite the fact that it is located on the west side of the Missouri river that is really a part of Iowa and that is a very well known fact in our community because the city of Omaha is always complaining that they have to render certain services to the city of Carter Lake, Iowa and real estate taxes and the state income taxes and the state sales tax has to go over to Des Monies over to Iowa."
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.687,765.993,This is why I was asking whether everybody really did not know what the situation was at all times?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,765.993,774.244,"I think that is pretty general knowledge because there is a community, there is a city that is known as the city of Carter Lake, Iowa."
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.244,775.532,You have a city hall there?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,775.532,779.766,"They have a city hall, they have a mayor and they have city council men."
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.766,791.296,"But I take it apart from this aspect in the background, the fact that it is on the west side of Missouri does not cut any ice in this litigation?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,791.296,798.274,Not in the least and particularly with respect to the question of jurisdiction.
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,798.274,804.862,When was it that when you raised this question that there was no jurisdiction.
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,806.536,812.895,"Your Honor, our original answer that was filed to the amended complaint as filed by the respondent --"
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,812.895,815.157,That was filed when?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,815.157,828.716,"Your Honor, the plaintiff’s amended complaint was filed directly against Owen on November 9, 1973."
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,855.759,862.188,Did you expressly raised the question that (Voice Overlap) principal office in Iowa and therefore there is no jurisdiction.
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,862.188,863.296,We did not at that time.
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,863.296,864.81,When did you?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,864.81,867.413,That was raised on the record.
1977.77-677,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,895.904,900.97,"Meanwhile, the statute of limitations may run in the State Courts?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,900.97,911.657,"Sir, the statute of limitations is two years in Iowa and the statute of limitations in this case had run on the 18th day of January 1974."
1977.77-677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,912.433,923.478,"Counsel, I gather from the majority in dissenting views in the Court of Appeals that there may be some difference on this point of view."
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,943.321,944.467,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1977.77-677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.721,967.159,Unless they are admitted in the pleadings.
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,967.159,988.743,"Unless they are admitted in the pleadings and in this case, we filed a general denial as to every claim made by the plaintiff again in our petition against us, or an amended complaint against us except the fact that the corporation, the Owens Equipment and Erecting Company was in fact incorporated under the laws of the state of Nebraska."
1977.77-677,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,988.743,992.169,So you admitted everything except the jurisdiction?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,992.169,995.402,"In effect, that is our position exactly, Your Honor."
1977.77-677,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,995.402,1002.67,You do not feel that you as a lawyer had any responsibility to tell the Court that it did not have jurisdiction?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1002.67,1003.782,"Let me say this, Your Honor."
1977.77-677,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1048.241,1055.585,You did know that they had their main office --
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1055.585,1058.266,We were at that same deposition in June of 1974.
1977.77-677,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1058.266,1060.614,Did you know where the main office of your client was?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1060.614,1062.76,"Yes, sir we did."
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.022,1073.692,"But Mr. Sodoro, did you know that when you filed your answer on October 15, 1973?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1073.692,1074.421,Not really.
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.421,1077.207,You did not really intend to deny the allegation then?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1077.207,1078.681,We denied it.
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.681,1080.886,You denied it without investigating the facts?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1080.886,1081.647,Let me say this to you.
1977.77-677,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1087.452,1088.975,Where did your check come from?
1977.77-677,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.975,1090.713,You are asking us to construe the answer.
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1095.133,1098.118,"We intended that as a denial because it says that, do you not see?"
1977.77-677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1101.367,1115.426,"Certainly, the customary interpretation was a civil procedure does not ordinarily take into contemplation intention with respect to the allegations of the pleading, does it?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1115.426,1119.355,"Rule 8 (b) provides I think generally, Your Honor to the effect that --"
1977.77-677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.355,1120.679,The thing speaks for itself.
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1120.679,1129.284,The thing speaks for itself and you are entitled to admit portions of affirmance and entitled to generally deny the rest of them and that is what we did in this case.
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1176.539,1186.346,How come the defendant filed a claim against a third party defendant from the same state he is?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1186.346,1189.042,"I am sorry sir what, I did not get you?"
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.042,1197.098,The defendant in the case may file a third party claim against a third party defendant who is from the same state as he is?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1197.098,1197.86,Right.
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1197.86,1203.921,That party may file a counter claim?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1203.921,1205.138,Absolutely.
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1205.138,1207.869,He may also file a claim against the plaintiff?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1207.869,1208.614,Yes sir.
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1210.418,1215.41,But your suggestion is the plaintiff could not counter claim against that claim?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1215.41,1220.252,That the plaintiff can never claim against the third party defendant and I think that the authority --
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.252,1222.564,"Now, what is your justification for that?"
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1222.564,1223.433,"Well, Your Honor I --"
1977.77-677,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1223.433,1228.135,The defendant could never have sued the third party defendant in the federal court?
1977.77-677,0,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,1228.135,1235.313,The theory is that the plaintiff selects the forum for the trial and disposition of the plaintiff’s claim.
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1375.351,1383.572,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-677,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1468.261,1477.302,At some point in your discussion would you enlighten us about the Iowa saving statute?
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1477.302,1510.457,"The Iowa savings statute Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice is a statute that from my knowledge of Iowa law is as vague and nebulous and its boundaries are as murky as Mr. Justice Blackmun mentioned about the boundaries of Iowa and Nebraska on the west side of Missouri River."
1977.77-677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.4,1538.611,"Counsel, if on this day before the case was to go to the jury, the pleadings have been called to judge Denny’s attention and he had construed the petitioners answer to the allegation as to diversity as a denial of your allegations as diversity he said we simply do not have diversity here."
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1551.973,1561.315,"Yes, Your Honor under the facts and circumstances of this particular case after the four years of litigation I think it would have been on abuse of his discretion at that point even."
1977.77-677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.315,1565.538,"Well, then you really do not regard Federal Courts as courts of limited jurisdiction."
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1575.375,1578.069,"Well, Your Honor; of course Federal Courts are courts of limited jurisdiction."
1977.77-677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.897,1600.467,What rule are you referring to?
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1600.467,1601.642,Rule 14.
1977.77-677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.501,1858.08,"But what if Owen had just chosen in its answer to flatly deny that it was a resident and citizen as you alleged it to be so that there was no way of interpreting its pleading other than a denial of diversity jurisdiction, but had done nothing more, would you still say that it was estop?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1858.08,1870.587,"Well, certainly for the 18 months after the statue ran there would have been no impropriety about going ahead because the Omaha Public Power District certainly would not have let Owen out."
1977.77-677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.317,1877.973,But is it not jurisdiction something that can be raised at any time?
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1877.973,1888.849,"Your Honor I believe a jurisdictional question if you say it can be raised at any time my answer is that, no, it cannot be raised at any time."
1977.77-677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.095,1901.06,You have got two cases from this Court.
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1919.261,1932.246,"Your Honor I was going to discuss, I felt and this is very difficult to stand before a Court who wrote the opinion and stand before the author of that opinion and tell him what I think he meant."
1977.77-677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.246,1940.254,Here is your opportunity to do so.
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1940.254,1959.671,I felt that you are very discerning and wonderfully narrowly limited decision in Aldinger would be an indication to attorneys that this is not an absolutely inflexible rule.
1977.77-677,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.671,1962.124,It was about Aldinger.
1977.77-677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1964.182,1966.912,I will give you one on the Second Circuit.
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1977.714,1980.836,"Yes, that would be on the amount of jurisdiction Your Honor."
1977.77-677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.836,1983.68,"It was jurisdiction, the word we are talking about."
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1990.063,1992.403,"Your Honor, I --"
1977.77-677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1992.403,1999.814,"Well, I agree with this you cannot raise jurisdiction (Inaudible)."
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,1999.814,2003.942,I would like to compare this to the justice at this situation was.
1977.77-677,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2005.575,2010.091,Let us take this case here.
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2025.755,2030.921,"As matter of truth and fact Mr. Justice Marshall, we were not, but that was raised and encountered to an affidavit."
1977.77-677,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2030.921,2041.971,"Anyway your allegation was that Owen was a corporation of Nebraska, the corporation of Nebraska that was your allegation, was it not?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2041.971,2042.794,Yes.
1977.77-677,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2042.794,2049.598,"Yes, and that on the face of the pleadings that suggested a resident of Iowa suing a resident of Nebraska, is it not?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2049.598,2050.431,Well of course Your Honor?
1977.77-677,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2050.431,2051.15,"Well, of course it is."
1977.77-677,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2051.15,2054.069,"And that was admitted, was it not, in the answer?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2054.069,2056.284,Yes Your Honor.
1977.77-677,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.284,2060.341,You do not suggest that in itself makes jurisdiction or you standing alone?
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2060.341,2061.652,Not completely.
1977.77-677,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2061.652,2070.125,"You were about to approach the question of ancillary or pendant type jurisdiction, would you care to pursue that?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2070.125,2085.523,I feel of course there is a parallel between ancillary and pendant jurisdiction and I like to think of this with respect to with your question Mr. Chief Justice and your question Mr. Justice Marshall with respect to what would have happened had this issue never been raised.
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.815,2154.303,"Do you not have to do differentiate between a verdict against Owen on the third party complaint brought by the Power District and the verdict against Owen on the amended complaint, but directly by Kroger against Owen?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2157.556,2159.151,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.66,2183.983,"Improperly, I suppose."
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2183.983,2191.288,They came out in a summary judgment so that that may be clear instead we sold that whole system to Paxton-Vierling Company.
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.373,2216.87,In other words there were two quite separate claims against Owen.
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2223.621,2224.452,Yes based on --
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.452,2230.301,"And once Omaha Power was out of the case then the third party complaint necessarily fell too, did it not?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2230.301,2232.609,"Not on the circumstances we feel, no Your Honor."
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.609,2241.804,"Well, how could they be liable by way of a third party complaint if the third plaintiff had prevailed, had been found not liable at all?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2241.804,2243.394,Do you mean my hypothetical case here?
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.394,2244.049,Yes.
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2244.049,2244.69,Alright.
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.035,2276.276,"But that would not justify a recovery on the third party complaint because a third party complaint is brought by Omaha Power against Owen and if Omaha Public Power had no liability and had no injury and nothing to recover over at the third party complaint, did they?"
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2276.276,2280.313,"Omaha Public Power District might have failed on its third party complaint, but I feel that we were --"
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.313,2285.638,Then you recover only directly against Owen just as though you never sued Omaha Power at all?
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2285.638,2293.237,"No, because we could not have sued Owen directly originally, but it was a proper and clear under rule 14 by Omaha Public Power District and then --"
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.237,2297.763,But only in so far as it related to Omaha Powers claim over against Owen.
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2306.197,2315.574,"Basically, the Omaha public power district alleged that Owen was negligent, and therefore, made them a third party defendant."
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.574,2318.751,And then you filed a separate pleading in which you made such allegations?
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2318.751,2320.174,Yes.
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.174,2323.981,And the question is whether that pleading is one that the Federal Court can entertain?
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2323.981,2340.912,"Yes, it is the old A against B, B against C, is there a question of can C counter claim against A, comments of Mr. Justice White, I believe pointed that up and A cannot proceed against C."
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.051,2345.932,Either a case is holding that A can proceed directly against C?
1977.77-677,1,46317,warren_c_schrempp,,2345.932,2349.554,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.77-677,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.554,2351.308,What are those cases?
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3217.862,3221.172,I do indeed Your Honor.
1977.77-677,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3221.172,3227.112,Do you think we could not take judicial notice of the certificate that we have been discussing?
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3229.444,3230.156,Of course not.
1977.77-677,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3233.437,3236.457,"If were in the record, we would not be talking about judicial notice."
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3239.89,3241.634,I do not think that is possible sir.
1977.77-677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3323.147,3326.66,Will you tell us where you are reading from?
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3326.66,3329.45,"I know it by heart, but I do not know if I can find it."
1977.77-677,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3329.45,3338.317,But we do not.
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3338.317,3392.473,"Would you please look at the appendix, page number 23, amended complaint at the bottom of the page gentlemen under paragraph II, the recitation made by this plaintiff in her direct claim now against the defendant is that the defendant, Omaha Public Power District, a public corporation is a public corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Nebraska in having its principal place of business in Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska; that the defendant, Owen Equipment and Erection Company is a corporation with its principal place of business in Nebraska."
1977.77-677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3418.08,3431.571,"Turning to page 28 of the appendix on paragraph I of your answer, you say you admit that Owen Equipment and Erection Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Nebraska."
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3431.571,3432.981,Right and that is all.
1977.77-677,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3463.747,3465.624,Where is that?
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3465.624,3466.108,Pardon Sir?
1977.77-677,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3466.108,3469.847,Where is judge Denny’s finding?
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3469.847,3482.626,I do not know if I can find it for you but it is also recited in the opinion of the Eighth Circuit.
1977.77-677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3567.739,3582.896,"It is not sufficient under these federal statutes and if the plaintiff is a resident of Iowa, the defendant corporation is incorporated in Iowa, but has its principal place of business, incorporated in Nebraska, but has its principal place of business in Iowa?"
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3582.896,3589.441,"Then for the purposes of the federal jurisdiction statute, both those parties are residents of the same state?"
1977.77-677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3589.441,3590.597,So there is no diversity.
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3590.597,3595.942,So there is no diversity of citizenship and all of the decisions are to that effect.
1977.77-677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3612.962,3616.465,And if the third party defendant is from the same state as the plaintiff?
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3616.465,3617.708,Yes.
1977.77-677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3636.815,3639.057,"You are saying again, he cannot but why?"
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3639.057,3646.193,"I am telling you that that is that decision and as a lawyer, I would like to think that we follow those decisions."
1977.77-677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3664.448,3679.449,But why may the third party defendant sue the plaintiff even though he is from the same state as the plaintiff?
1977.77-677,2,23120,emil_f_sodoro,,3679.449,3711.019,"It appears that the rationale or at least the rationale I get from the examination of the cases is, the plaintiff has selected the forum and although has not made a direct claim against the third party defendant that the third party defendant because he is brought into the case in which he had no participation concerning the institution then, has that right as a matter of defense of his claim against the original defendant to counterclaim against the plaintiff."
1977.77-677,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3715.06,3715.756,"Thank you, gentlemen."
