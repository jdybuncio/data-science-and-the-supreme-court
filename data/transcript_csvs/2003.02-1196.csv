2003.02-1196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,26.0,34.423,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1196, the Securities and Exchange Commission v. Charles E. Edwards."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1661.71,1669.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1731.888,1735.891,Is it your position that no debt security could ever be an investment contract?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1735.891,1741.92,"As long as it was a fixed return, that is correct."
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.92,1746.832,"Well, why it distinguished between a fixed return and an other kind of debt security?"
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1746.832,1767.554,"Well, under the SEC's explanation in its briefs, it refers to a lot of things as fixed returns, which are really just sham, boastful promises by promoters, and I believe that's what takes this situation completely out of what the SEC is proposing."
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.58,1781.399,And you contend that test would never cover a debt security?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1782.181,1783.09,That is correct.
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1795.6,1801.46,What would be the underlying reason for excluding debt securities and limiting the coverage of the Act to equity securities?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1801.46,1803.031,"Investment risk, Your Honor."
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.35,1805.836,"Well, there was an investment risk here."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1805.836,1824.495,"Well, there really wasn't, because what you have is a commercial lease arrangement, a telephone acts as the collateral, so to speak, to use this Court's words from the Reves case, but you have a commercial lease arrangement like commercial lease arrangements done throughout the country..."
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1824.495,1827.096,"Well, but this is a leasing arrangement that's really a financing arrangement."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1831.925,1832.397,It did...
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.397,1834.321,and this is really a financing transaction.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1834.321,1836.672,"It can be characterized that way, Your Honor."
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.21,1842.782,"Well, certainly the person's return, it didn't depend on what happened in his own phone booth, the one he happened to own."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1847.818,1852.442,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor, and that is a credit risk, not an investment risk."
2003.02-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.442,1853.39,What's preferred stock?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1853.39,1863.421,"Preferred stock is an...  has both investment risk, because it can have fluctuating values, some do."
2003.02-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1863.421,1864.248,So can debt.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1864.248,1869.16,Debt can if there's a market for the debt.
2003.02-1196,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1869.698,1870.153,There is.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1870.153,1886.583,"But the investor...  that's correct...  but the characterization of the return to the investor in debt is generally viewed as...  as a return, the interest rate, and as far as the market...  market..."
2003.02-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.583,1887.343,That is preferred stock.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1887.343,1891.884,"Preferred stock, but it's a capital appreciation issue and that's not an issue here."
2003.02-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.884,1892.794,So can debt appreciate.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1892.794,1897.624,"Well, that's right, but that's capital appreciation and we don't have capital appreciation in this case."
2003.02-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.624,1898.655,What about bonds?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1906.252,1909.224,"That's correct, and a bond is a fixed return instrument."
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1909.224,1910.05,It is indeed.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1910.05,1914.797,It's a specifically designated type of security by Congress.
2003.02-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.964,1949.803,"Yes, but...  but when some of the things that are specifically listed are fixed return items, it seems hard to credit your contention that somehow the reason investment contracts cannot cover this particular arrangement is because this arrangement has a fixed return."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1959.008,1968.007,"Without question, it did, but Congress and...  and this Court has stated very clearly, certainly in the Reves case..."
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1968.007,1974.119,"Yeah, but the Reves case was dictum, and the question here is, are we going to turn that dictum into a holding?"
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,1996.41,2010.156,"Our position is that investment contract is an equity-type security, and we think that is founded on all of the history and when Congress used the term investment contract..."
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2010.156,2016.183,"Let...  let me...  I...  I don't want to be...  be short with you, but I don't think you're getting at what he and I want."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2029.846,2031.582,Because...
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2031.582,2033.933,It's being marketed as a classic investment scheme.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2035.79,2039.671,Because this is a...  this is a commercial lease.
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2039.671,2042.728,"Well, it's not a...  a normal commercial lease."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2065.306,2067.369,"Well, I...  I disagree with Your Honor."
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2078.887,2087.514,"But it's being marketed not to people who want to go into the lease business, but people who want to invest their money and sit back at home and get at return."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2087.514,2094.822,"That may be true, but it cannot be denied that in fact there was a lease agreement."
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2102.996,2103.534,Let's assume it is not denied.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2112.284,2120.252,There were leases that were being used for commercial purposes in 1933.
2003.02-1196,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.113,2142.915,"No, but as a public policy issue, I have the same question Justice Souter has."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2191.418,2198.559,"Justice O'Connor, the...  the only answer I can give is because it does not have investment risk."
2003.02-1196,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.552,2213.753,"Well, I suppose it does from the standpoint of the management required to make this scheme work."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2213.753,2215.982,"Well, that's a credit risk..."
2003.02-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.982,2226.839,"Anybody who was investing in...  in payphones in the era of the...  the satellite was taking an investment risk, I would think."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2226.839,2228.325,"Well, when the..."
2003.02-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.325,2232.512,Like the buggy went just before the horse...  just before the automobile.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2232.512,2234.353,Justice Scalia...
2003.02-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.353,2236.582,Must mean something special by investment risk.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2256.356,2269.647,"Well, the...  the money that was lost was lost as a result of a bankruptcy and what occurred in the bankruptcy, but when the bankruptcy was filed, these phone owners still owned their telephones and they were still entitled to their lease payments."
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.137,2296.192,I'm sure you don't think a person who buys a bond doesn't take an investment risk.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2296.192,2301.765,"A person who buys a bond takes a credit risk, not an investment risk."
2003.02-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.54,2304.533,There's a significant...
2003.02-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.533,2309.938,You think buying a...  a whole portfolio of bonds is not an investment?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2309.938,2320.795,"Well, it...  it is an investment, but it...  it is not the type of investment risk that you see in fluctuating values securities or equity securities."
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2320.795,2322.57,Have you ever held a bond when interest rates were going up?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2322.57,2325.336,I...  I agree...
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.336,2327.399,You would have learned what an investment risk was.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2327.399,2335.738,"Justice Souter, I agree that bonds can fluctuate in value and that deals with a capital appreciation..."
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2335.738,2338.052,Which means that it is more than a mere credit risk.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2338.052,2352.17,"To the extent you were looking to the bond to return a value and...  and hold it for purposes of changing value, it theoretically could."
2003.02-1196,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2352.17,2357.182,And anyone who buys a bond with the possible expectation of selling before maturity assumes exactly that.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2357.182,2363.398,"They are going to face that risk and that...  that is, in fact, an investment risk."
2003.02-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2398.321,2421.81,"Mr. Wolensky, you don't challenge, do you, that under State Blue Sky Laws, this distinction between variable and fixed return is not made, that State Blue Sky Laws treat as investment contracts...  do not draw the line between fixed and variable returns?"
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2421.81,2438.528,The...  the challenge I make is that before 1933 the State Blue Sky Laws that were...  cases that were incorporated and mentioned in Joiner and in Howey were variable return cases.
2003.02-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2442.038,2453.472,Do you agree that there are a body of cases under State Blue Sky Laws that involve...  maybe some of them even involve these payphone schemes...  but that have fixed and not variable returns?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2453.472,2454.753,"As of today, that is correct."
2003.02-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2467.385,2498.343,"So why, if this notion of an investment contracts comes out of State Blue Sky laws and we are told that the one thing in this area, because schemes are invented every day, is that...  that the interpretation should be flexible, not static, to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of money of others?"
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2498.343,2503.915,"Justice Ginsburg, this Court has...  has repeated that over and over."
2003.02-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2529.261,2542.886,"But when the issue isn't in the case, what a court says in a casual footnote, when the case had nothing to do with fixed versus variable returns."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2591.555,2620.366,"Justice Ginsburg, in Forman, the Court had to address the issue of whether there was an investment contract involved, and it stated what I would call the Forman formulation of profits in connection with doing that analysis on the three types of profits that allegedly...  or that had been found and allegedly were present in the Second Circuit decision, and it applied that formulation to each one of those."
2003.02-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2621.375,2626.022,But it did...  but the case was not about equity versus debt classification.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2654.174,2656.032,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-1196,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2660.452,2664.948,"Well, but in...  in Forman there was no distinction between fixed and variable income."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2664.948,2679.437,"It was not, but when you read the...  Justice Kennedy, when you read what the Court said in Forman, it's talking about an expectation of profits or capital appreciation, and those are two variable forms."
2003.02-1196,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2737.317,2741.813,But I thought that...  I thought that the meaning of investment contract was not at issue in Reves.
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2741.813,2754.24,"The meaning of investment contract was not at issue, but distinguishing investment contract was at issue in Reves, and explaining why it was not applicable in that case."
2003.02-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.493,2769.638,"And it's...  it's taken that position for a long time, Mr. Wolensky."
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2789.163,2791.763,"Well, if I can address..."
2003.02-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.763,2795.645,Why shouldn't we defer to the F...  SEC's judgement about the matter?
2003.02-1196,1,36836,michael_k_wolensky,,2795.645,2798.124,"If I can address that for just a moment, Justice Scalia..."
2003.02-1196,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.124,2799.072,That's why I asked the question.
2003.02-1196,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2799.072,2799.981,I hoped you would.
