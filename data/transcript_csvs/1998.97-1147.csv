1998.97-1147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.92,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-1147, Minnesota v. Wayne Thomas Carter and Melvin Jones."
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,9.522,11.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,66.156,69.941,"Mr. Backstrom, may I slow you down a minute by asking you a question?"
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,89.852,95.09,"Well, Your Honor, I do not believe that it would."
1998.97-1147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,100.227,108.148,"I know the Fourth Amendment was, but could the State pass a statute that gave additional protection to a defendant without violating the Federal Constitution?"
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,108.148,108.582,Yes.
1998.97-1147,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,120.473,123.942,Do you think standing is always a Federal question?
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,123.942,151.742,"Your Honor, I believe it is an important Federal question, and when a decision is based upon the Federal Constitution, as it was in this case, then I think the Federal standard should apply and, as this Court has been very consistent in applying its standards, in essence a totality of the circumstances test, which we would argue is the appropriate analysis to be used in determining whether someone has a significant enough connection to the premises to give them a legitimate expectation of privacy--"
1998.97-1147,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.742,164.752,"Well, given the reasoning of Rakas, would it be fair to answer Justice Stevens by saying this isn't a standing question at all, it's a question of the substantive reach of the Fourth Amendment?"
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,177.81,205.394,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, as he wrote that particular opinion, indicated that the question which was formally referred to as standing is a subjective issue in terms of having to analyze the issues, but there's still... it's still important that a criminal defendant establish a significant enough connection to a particular premise as to give them an expectation of privacy that society is willing to accept as being reasonable."
1998.97-1147,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,205.394,211.733,"Yes, but that's a substantive interpretation of the Fourth Amendment."
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,221.423,238.317,"But... Your Honor, I believe Rakas made it very clear that the appropriate test to apply in these particular provisions is one which looks at an individual's first subjective expectation of privacy and then whether that's the type of expectation that society is willing to accept as being reasonable."
1998.97-1147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,245.454,253.06,"--you said brief, which was a few hours, and you said brief time, unlawful purpose."
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,269.504,271.021,"--I do not believe it would, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.079,302.875,"But you wouldn't know about whether they were there for a lawful purpose before you began this search, so it can't turn on the... can we take that out of it, whether they're there to play poker or whether they're there to prepare drugs?"
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,302.875,304.927,"No, I do not believe you can, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,339.433,348.106,"What you're saying, aren't you, is that whenever there is a need to invoke a Fourth Amendment protection this factor is going to count against the need?"
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,364.465,372.304,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe what I'm saying is the nature of the activity involved is a factor to be considered under a totality test."
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,372.304,379.725,"So I mean, the tendency of what you're saying is that criminals should not have a right to raise Fourth Amendment issues under a totality test."
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,380.41,382.077,"No, that is not what I'm saying, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,382.077,389.683,--Then tell me how the criminal nature of the activity properly counts if that is not the tendency of what you're arguing.
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,389.683,395.002,Criminal activity is obviously not the type of conduct that's normally associated with the privacy of a dwelling.
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.073,406.477,"Oh, I thought you were arguing that it should provide a burden, as it were, in the test."
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,407.877,408.71,"--No, we're not, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,408.71,409.127,Okay.
1998.97-1147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.127,415.75,Was there any testimony at all from the defendant in this case as to how long he had been there?
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,419.052,420.052,"The record is silent, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.306,431.693,"Yes, I would think so, that if he's claiming a violation of the Fourth Amendment he's got to show that it was his rights that were infringed."
1998.97-1147,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,431.693,452.873,"The States have applied various standards in courts to determine whether there's a Fourth Amendment violation with regard to a visitor in a home and, as I look at the cases, they seem to turn quite often on the extent to which the visitor has control over the premises."
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,474.787,476.139,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.956,507.776,"Mr. Backstrom, what happened to the occupier, the resident in this case?"
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,509.676,514.764,"--Yes, Your Honor, she was charged and convicted as well of the same charges that these two defendants were."
1998.97-1147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,514.764,518.299,"--Convicted as a result of trial, or a guilty plea, or--"
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,518.299,521.6,"She was convicted after a trial in this case, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,521.6,534.177,"--Mr. Backstrom, you said a moment ago at the beginning of your argument that the position below was tantamount to the readoption of the automatic standing rule, and I'm wondering if it is."
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,573.735,588.912,"Well, we do believe the rule below, Your Honor, would establish the automatic standing legitimately on the premises, because we believe that the near engagement in a common task with a resident or a property possessor is basically tantamount to establishing that."
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.895,591.447,What about a line I suggested?
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,622.985,624.585,"--I do not believe it is, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,631.388,631.655,Right.
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,631.655,632.088,--a process.
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,632.338,636.54,The owner of the apartment was engaging in the business activity with them.
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,640.842,653.917,"--Well, as this Court pointed out in Lewis v. United States, Your Honor, when the home is converted for business purposes, that business is entitled to no greater sanctity than if it were carried on in a store, a garage, or a car."
1998.97-1147,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,659.155,673.998,"Well, are you then saying the reason is that it was business, whereas if it had been a criminal enterprise not for profit, you would admit the distinction, the line that I was suggesting?"
1998.97-1147,0,29125,james_c_backstrom,,686.461,700.519,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe what we're arguing here is that the business differential, the business versus a social guest is a line to be drawn, and an important one, but that's not to say that business visitors don't have the rights of privacy--"
1998.97-1147,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.519,705.173,Do you know of many nonprofit criminal enterprises?
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1083.371,1092.71,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1114.64,1119.294,How would you answer the question I put to the petitioner's counsel?
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1119.294,1121.011,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy."
1998.97-1147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1121.011,1126.265,"What is the difference between your approach and the State's approach, if any, in your briefs?"
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1126.265,1127.717,I think our approach is similar.
1998.97-1147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1161.271,1164.49,Does frequency of visitation enter into that balance?
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1164.49,1170.393,"It would be one thing that a trial court would be justified in looking at, but I don't believe it would be dispositive."
1998.97-1147,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1170.393,1173.678,"Related status between the party, cousin versus friends?"
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1173.678,1179.582,"I think that when you have relatives, that might tend to suggest that this person's more likely to be treated as a member of the household."
1998.97-1147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.582,1181.101,Even if he's not an overnight guest.
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1189.29,1190.79,"No, Your Honor, we would not go that far."
1998.97-1147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1190.79,1194.259,"--You have an absolute rule that if it's not overnight it's not covered, is that it?"
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1194.259,1195.194,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.15,1207.086,I'm excluding spending the night.
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1216.107,1225.963,"--Well, Your Honor, if the cousin is treated as a temporary member of the household... for example, he's free to let himself in or admit others... I think the cousin might well have a legitimate expectation--"
1998.97-1147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.963,1226.58,What if he's not a cousin.
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1233.403,1236.955,--I think the illegality of the conduct is something this Court traditionally sets aside.
1998.97-1147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.973,1241.423,Right.
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1241.423,1244.359,"--because he engaged in armed robbery, but the Court didn't look at specifically the illegal--"
1998.97-1147,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.359,1250.513,"So this would be... he would have... you're saying he would have the Fourth Amendment privilege as well, just like the cousin."
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1250.513,1257.934,"--He's very similar to the defendant in Jones, except for the fact he doesn't spend the night, in that he exercises control over the premises and is treated as a member of the household."
1998.97-1147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1262.922,1264.905,So you do not say he must be an overnight guest.
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1264.905,1265.322,No.
1998.97-1147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.307,1270.659,And also it could be a commercial arrangement.
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1278.432,1281.717,"--No, I don't believe a babysitter would have a legitimate expectation of privacy."
1998.97-1147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.717,1282.1,"Oh, you don't."
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1282.1,1290.99,"Although there is some element of control in the fact that the babysitter stands in the shoes of the parents, it's a very limited element, and the babysitter is not a functional equivalent to a member of the household."
1998.97-1147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.291,1300.695,"But the drug dealer who comes once a week, because he has a key and has lunch there, is?"
1998.97-1147,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1300.695,1301.63,If the--
1998.97-1147,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.63,1303.88,I'll go with the babysitter over the drug dealer.
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1709.671,1710.154,Right.
1998.97-1147,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.154,1717.694,"--which was Exhibit 39, which is the close up of the blind in question."
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1724.264,1731.185,"Actually, that was a matter of much discussion during the hearing, is that they did not admit that that's how the blinds were."
1998.97-1147,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.185,1732.954,What was the finding of the--
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1732.954,1734.154,There has been no findings regarding that--
1998.97-1147,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1734.154,1736.922,--So we don't know in what condition--
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1736.922,1737.489,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1737.489,1747.814,"--Do you understand Justice O'Connor's question to relate to the window to the immediate left of the door and to the right of the bike, or to the double windows that are to the left of the bike and under the balcony?"
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1747.814,1749.597,If you'll look at Exhibit I 2--
1998.97-1147,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.597,1751.015,I 2?
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1751.015,1761.537,"--I 2... excuse me, Exhibit 9 on page I 2 of the joint appendix, you can see... I think this represents, if you look at the bottom of the building, there's a little window there, and then there's a bicycle."
1998.97-1147,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1765.608,1767.558,The windows that are under the balcony.
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1767.558,1771.495,"Exactly right, Your Honor, under the balcony behind the bushes."
1998.97-1147,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.685,1780.018,Why?
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1845.96,1850.345,I think the bushes will protect you from looking into these windows.
1998.97-1147,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.345,1852.464,How do they in Exhibit 10 protect me?
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1865.374,1877.698,"But in this case these officers went over the bushes, which is what the Minnesota supreme court found, crawled over the bushes to get to these windows, and so I think it's clear that these bushes were protected... were put there so you would not walk by these windows."
1998.97-1147,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1877.698,1884.018,"Well, if you look at Exhibit 12, I 5, there's no obstruction by the bushes at all."
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1885.852,1891.672,"The lawn is a big lawn in front, but these bushes are protecting this particular window, and I think--"
1998.97-1147,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.672,1893.874,"Well, not in Exhibit 12 they're not."
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1893.874,1896.393,"--Right, and I think the angle depends on it, if you're looking at--"
1998.97-1147,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1896.393,1903.647,"So if you walked up from that side, from the place where that photo was taken, there's no bush in between."
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1903.647,1904.063,--That's correct.
1998.97-1147,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.63,1907.682,Why did the officer... just... why did he crawl over this bush?
1998.97-1147,2,17551,bradford_colbert,,1917.139,1924.71,"It's not clear to me, and this picture was not taken... because this was obviously taken during the day, and the search itself took place at night, and the other part of it--"
1998.97-1147,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.71,1926.412,One other question.
1998.97-1147,3,29125,james_c_backstrom,,3245.982,3246.901,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3269.648,3274.152,"What do you mean, he'd worn them out... he was walking outside the apartment, so he might have arrived in slippers?"
1998.97-1147,3,29125,james_c_backstrom,,3274.152,3274.602,Yes.
1998.97-1147,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3295.549,3299.786,"Well, they will know, as they did here, whether there are persons other than the homeowner."
1998.97-1147,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.786,3305.707,"Going back to the facts for a minute, is it your view we should accept the facts as stated in the Minnesota supreme court's opinion?"
1998.97-1147,3,29125,james_c_backstrom,,3305.707,3308.173,"--Yes, we believe you should, Your Honor."
1998.97-1147,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3323.299,3324.632,"Thank you, Mr. Backstrom."
