2000.99-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.043,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1848, Buckhannon Board and Care Home v. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,12.465,15.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.072,63.836,"Well, the language of the statutes in each case, does it not, refers to prevailing party?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,63.836,65.289,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does."
2000.99-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,65.289,70.692,So we do have to be satisfied that the person seeking fees is a prevailing party.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,70.692,71.255,Absolutely.
2000.99-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.255,76.847,And how is that to be determined where the case is dismissed as moot?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,76.847,98.899,"Well, I think in that situation, we have a declaration that the case is moot, so... in this particular case we had that as well... and then we can look and see under what is known as the catalyst theory, whether that lawsuit caused the defendant to act to render that suit moot."
2000.99-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.899,117.611,"I would have thought the language, prevailing party, suggests something else, that there ought to be some nominal damages, or some judgment, or some indication that the person seeking fees did, in fact, prevail in a judicial proceeding."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,117.611,123.514,"If we look just to the word, prevail, I believe it is a broad word, and this is my point."
2000.99-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,130.293,134.948,"But the term, prevailing party, has a pretty well-established meaning in the law, doesn't it?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,140.727,143.929,"--Yes, and I think that's a fine way to put it."
2000.99-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.22,163.093,But that's not the way lawsuits are ordinarily settled.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,173.604,174.182,That's correct.
2000.99-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.182,180.086,--that it was dismissed not because of mootness but because you're paid.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,180.086,201.78,"That's right, but... and that's the same thing in this situation, where, when I sue somebody and I say, don't shut down my home, don't throw the residents out of the home, and they say, okay, we won't do that, now, I don't have a judgment, consent decree, or settlement, but I have the same effect, the same result as if they had handed me the $50,000."
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.78,203.499,But that's not what the statute says.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,225.334,225.755,And--
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.755,228.941,"--other than simply, it came out the way the plaintiff would have liked."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,228.941,233.706,"--And that is one of the factors that is looked at, whether there is a causal relationship between--"
2000.99-1848,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.706,234.844,But you would have to establish it.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,236.735,237.837,--Absolutely.
2000.99-1848,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,237.837,245.691,"--that the litigation caused the result, caused, in this case, the homes to remain open, even though they didn't have the--"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,245.691,248.653,"Absolutely, and that is what we intend to do."
2000.99-1848,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,261.862,268.778,"--All right, suppose I sue my next-door neighbor for making loud music at night and keeping me awake, all right."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,303.779,314.077,"When you look to the prior decisions of this Court, the definition of prevailing party under the cases has been, they personally achieve some of the benefits they sought in bringing the suit."
2000.99-1848,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.452,326.013,And those are cases in which there was no piece of paper saying anything?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,326.013,329.435,--Sometimes there are settlement agreements--
2000.99-1848,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,329.435,340.785,"No, but the question is, is there a case which, the person got just what he wanted, but there is no piece of paper saying anything in the lawsuit."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,342.787,343.328,--Right.
2000.99-1848,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,347.49,348.041,All right.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,348.041,349.902,There are obviously numerous cases in the courts of appeals.
2000.99-1848,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,349.902,350.242,Then we're back to my question.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,366.853,367.363,Right.
2000.99-1848,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,367.363,370.025,"--but for a piece of paper that says, I terminate the lawsuit?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,370.025,370.937,Two reasons.
2000.99-1848,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,370.937,371.638,That's the basic question--
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,371.638,372.038,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,372.038,373.708,"--in the case, and I want to hear your answer."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,373.708,374.339,Two reasons.
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.38,410.053,I'm sure every Member of Congress read that case.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,418.601,419.63,I think that that--
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.63,422.281,How many people do you think knew what that case held?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,425.774,429.778,--I think that it is consistent--
2000.99-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.778,433.999,"There is a presumption that we follow that the Congresspeople know what the law is, isn't there?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,433.999,434.389,--Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,434.389,435.721,We said that in some of our opinions.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,435.721,436.182,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,436.182,436.963,"Cannon, for example."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,436.963,439.794,"Yes, and I think that had they--"
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.794,441.957,Do they know what the court of appeals law is?
2000.99-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.519,448.001,"The Marr case was a Supreme Court case, wasn't it?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,448.001,451.223,"--Yes, and this was section 1988."
2000.99-1848,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.379,501.236,"Mr. Arceneaux, in the event of ambiguity, I am reluctant to read a term in a way that's going to get courts into areas that it's very difficult for them to maneuver in."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,514.976,515.496,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.496,524.534,And you want to show that the legislators who change the law were motivated by this lawsuit.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,566.221,569.674,"I do not think that we have to make that inquiry, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,571.654,572.466,"Well, I'm happy to hear that."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,572.466,572.876,--Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.876,573.567,But I'd like to know why.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,573.567,578.258,"And I will tell you, Your Honor, because West Virginia is unique."
2000.99-1848,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,604.445,605.547,What will you do?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,606.669,617.155,"We think that we have an overwhelmingly strong case, because what happened here, we took the deposition of the State fire marshal in March of 1997."
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.753,646.293,But he had no authority to change the rules.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,647.555,649.088,But he had to initiate the process.
2000.99-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.088,657.773,"You said, I thought, that you wouldn't have to deal with the legislature at all, but here it had to be passed by the legislature."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,657.773,664.648,"That's correct, but we don't believe that in looking at the causation analysis we need to look at what the legislature did."
2000.99-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.24,670.844,"Well, I'm amazed that you say that."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,679.089,681.433,"Clearly they did, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,681.433,688.155,"Okay, well, how do you get from the fire marshal's change of mind to the legislature's legislation?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,690.248,694.911,The unique process of the rulemaking process that's in West Virginia.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,699.074,701.245,Just tell me what... tell us what happened in this case.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,702.997,709.268,--And all of the exhibits that are attached to our motion for attorney's fees has this all documented in it.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,709.268,711.351,"Okay, but we want to know here and now."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,711.351,711.672,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,721.707,722.779,"Well, is that what he did?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,722.779,723.329,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.329,726.092,"Did he go to the fire commission and said, I want to change these rules?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,726.092,726.643,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,726.643,729.434,"And the fire commission says, we agree, we will change these rules?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,729.434,729.694,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,729.694,731.577,And the fire commission then did what?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,731.577,736.29,"Then the fire commission has to promulgate the new rules, and then they submit them to the legislature."
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,736.29,736.57,And what--
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,736.57,737.97,There's a special committee.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,737.97,744.885,--Was the legislation that was passed in effect the verbatim embodiment of what the fire commission proposed?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,744.885,750.238,"I believe that to be the case, and that is why I referred to the legislature in this process as merely a rubber stamp."
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.238,761.387,"Now, do you think the fire commissioner changed his mind because he was afraid of losing the lawsuit, or because he was persuaded that it was a good idea?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,761.387,763.758,We think he was motivated by the lawsuit.
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.758,764.857,Can you prove that?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,766.64,770.811,"Well, as some of the courts have noted... I don't know what is in his mind."
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.811,771.372,Exactly.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,772.213,772.884,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.884,776.788,What if your lawsuit... what if he had nothing to do with the lawsuit.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,798.603,801.105,"Well, we have two distinctions that I would draw."
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.292,828.463,Instead of reading it in the paper.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,831.285,836.19,"--Well, most of the cases that I've seen where they talk about the legislature... and there are some cases that are simple."
2000.99-1848,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.357,882.88,Do you rely at all on your warding off the cease and desist order?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,882.88,883.281,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,883.281,890.257,"Which, if you had done nothing would have surely followed, and then you would have been the object of an adverse judgment."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,890.257,892.728,"Yes, and we believe that we prevailed."
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,922.677,930.174,"Well, my goodness, you don't become a prevailing party by getting a preliminary order just leaving the status quo in effect while the case is being adjudicated."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,931.783,932.795,We think that it is part.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,935.948,954.127,"Does it matter to your case whether the fire... whatever it is, the fire marshal's judgment, or for that matter the legislature's judgment, was based on the fact that they thought the law was outrageous, as distinct from the fact that they may not have wanted to take a hit by losing this case?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,955.169,958.832,"Well, we think that our lawsuit brought that to their attention."
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,958.832,959.953,But that's not my question.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,964.525,966.137,I think we have to show--
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,966.137,980.005,"--whether they simply said, we're suddenly aware of the law and we think it's bad and it ought to be changed, or on the other hand they say, we think the law is great, but we don't want to lose this lawsuit, so we're going to change the law?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,981.415,983.578,--I think that it would relate to the causal relationship.
2000.99-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.17,989.131,But why isn't--
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,989.131,990.07,Your Honor--
2000.99-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.07,992.434,--Why isn't... each case why isn't there a causal relationship?
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,998.779,999.548,I really was.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,1002.65,1003.601,--Maybe I'm--
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1003.601,1004.823,I'm with you.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,1008.427,1010.276,--Maybe I was just distracted by the light.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1011.068,1013.459,Isn't there causation in either case?
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,1013.459,1014.39,--Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1014.39,1021.673,"The one cause, the lawsuit brings it to the attention, but for the lawsuit it would not have come to the attention, it wouldn't have been changed."
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,1032.04,1032.662,"Yes, I agree."
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.662,1043.878,"Then why not, just reading about it in the papers, the legislators read about this lawsuit, and but for this lawsuit they would never have known about this outrageous law, and that's enough, right?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,1043.878,1044.348,Yes.
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.271,1046.923,The fire marshal had nothing to do with it.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,1049.455,1050.885,--That would be a different case.
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.885,1054.818,"I know it would be a different case, but why would it be different as far as your claim is concerned?"
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,1054.818,1059.83,We think as long as we have the opportunity to establish causation we should be able to do so.
2000.99-1848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.83,1060.561,And that's causation.
2000.99-1848,0,43751,webster_j_arceneaux_iii,,1066.806,1069.457,"Your Honor, may I reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal?"
2000.99-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.457,1070.909,"Very well, Mr. Arceneaux."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1074.232,1086.911,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1113.939,1130.679,"In this case, was the matter moot as a matter of Article III jurisdiction, so the judge had no choice, or would the judge have had some discretion to retain jurisdiction to enter some sort of declaratory relief?"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1130.679,1139.134,"It appears, Your Honor, that it was, in fact, moot because of a legislative change under this Court's standards in Laidlaw and City of Mesquite."
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1148.581,1161.23,"I take it the usual rule is that it must be absolutely clear that the alleged wrongful conduct cannot recur before the case can be dismissed, is that the way the rule works?"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1161.23,1162.93,"--Yes, for mootness, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1167.443,1175.739,Could the plaintiff here have asked for nominal damages in order to keep the case alive?
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1175.739,1180.921,"No, Your Honor, because this is Ex parte Young case against State officials enforcing a law."
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.921,1181.442,"Oh, okay."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1181.442,1182.614,That's often the situation.
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.974,1246.614,"Ms. Brinkmann, what if I were a member of the West Virginia legislature and I know this suit has been pending for a long time, and they have hired very expensive lawyers to sue the State, there's a lot of money involved, and I would really... I think this is a dumb law that's on the books, and I would really like to change that law, but then the fire marshal comes to me and he says, you know, if you change that law, the State is going to be liable for millions of dollars in attorneys' fees, because it will be held that the suit was the catalyst for the change, and we'll have to pay all this money."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1263.348,1264.887,A couple of--
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.887,1265.959,They don't think they're going to lose.
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1272.473,1274.096,"--A couple of responses, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.541,1313.222,I understand.
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1313.222,1323.577,"In addition to that, the defendant is able to defend against the causation and the merits issue in this type of litigation."
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.123,1342.179,"Do you have to show, in order to establish the causation you're talking about, that the legislature made the change because it knew it would lose the lawsuit?"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1350.785,1351.707,No.
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.05,1357.179,"Ah, well--"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1357.179,1358.411,--that you would have to show that the merit... that--
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.411,1367.277,"--So they could have changed it for a reason that has nothing to do with their... with the lawsuit, except that the lawsuit brought the matter to their attention, even though they weren't worried about losing the lawsuit."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1367.277,1367.718,--That would not--
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.718,1368.589,They knew they could win the lawsuit.
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1368.589,1372.993,"--That would not establish the causation requirement, and I want to--"
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.993,1373.892,"Wait, that... it--"
2000.99-1848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.892,1375.184,"--Why wouldn't it, Ms. Brinkmann?"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1375.184,1379.665,--Because it would not establish that that change was made as a result of the lawsuit.
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1418.741,1430.57,"Well, except that the statute says, prevailing party, and it's quite logical, I think, to read the term, prevailing party, as meaning that you should have something to show from the lawsuit itself."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1430.57,1432.453,--And you do have something to show in these cases.
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1438.505,1441.077,"Yes, but it's not a part of any decree."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1441.077,1446.39,"--No, Your Honor, and in a settlement, it is very analogous to a settlement and a consent decree."
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1446.39,1450.373,"Yes, but except that a typical settlement, you'll get some document from the court."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1450.373,1463.932,"But it's simply a contract, Your Honor, just as the law here, a separate lawsuit would have to be brought to enforce that, in fact, under this Court's opinion in Kincannon, it's not even clear there would be a Federal cause of action to enforce that."
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.454,1468.937,"If you get a settlement approved by the court, the court will enforce that settlement, won't it?"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1468.937,1471.378,--As your opinion explains--
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.378,1472.269,So you really have to prevail.
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1477.803,1479.032,"--But, Your Honor, it depends."
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1512.707,1518.32,"Ms. Brinkmann, correct me if I'm wrong, I think there's a difference between your position and Mr. Arceneaux's."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1537.441,1538.773,"No, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1538.773,1539.254,No?
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1539.254,1540.323,I must have misspoken.
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1540.323,1540.713,Okay.
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1540.713,1548.891,I thought your question to me was a situation in which there were other policy reasons that the legislature had taken into account to change the law.
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.191,1562.882,Even if the legislature just read about it in the newspapers?
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1562.882,1563.782,--If it--
2000.99-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.782,1564.753,That's a factual predicate.
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1569.207,1570.685,--If the lawsuit brought that about.
2000.99-1848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1571.827,1575.35,We'd have to read the Palzgraf case in order for this all to work out?
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1576.189,1583.105,"--Proximate causation does come to mind, Your Honor, when we talk about the fact that it cannot be a frivolous or a meritless claim--"
2000.99-1848,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1583.105,1588.868,"But it sounds like but-for causation, not proximate cause, that you're talking about."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1588.868,1591.051,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that--"
2000.99-1848,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1591.051,1605.768,Why wouldn't that enable an astute lawyer to kind of spot administrative or legislative changes in the offing and file some suit so they can run in and get some kind of attorney's fees?
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1605.768,1608.692,"--Your Honor, the lower courts have rejected just those types of claims--"
2000.99-1848,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1608.692,1611.304,You don't object to tough causation requirements?
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1611.304,1612.023,"--No, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1612.023,1612.303,All right.
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1612.303,1613.935,We believe that that's the meaning of the statute--
2000.99-1848,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1613.935,1616.717,"And you respect Justice Scalia's practical point, which I thought was correct, isn't it?"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1637.04,1638.63,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1638.63,1639.802,"That also is a practical problem, isn't it?"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1639.802,1640.753,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1640.753,1648.848,"Is it a practical problem also for the legislature to be caught in what I'd call a formal settlement, with a Government department?"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1673.255,1674.967,I'm not sure I understand your question.
2000.99-1848,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1674.967,1680.47,"If you recover only if a there's a piece of paper called, settlement, that means there are words on a piece of paper--"
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1680.47,1680.74,Yes.
2000.99-1848,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1680.74,1690.615,"--filed in court, those words can sometimes extend to thousands of pages, and legislatures and Governments don't like to be subject to such decrees."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1690.615,1694.64,"That's absolutely correct, and this is the most efficient... may I respond to that--"
2000.99-1848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.64,1696.259,"No, I think that's enough, Ms. Brinkmann."
2000.99-1848,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1696.259,1697.111,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.111,1699.414,"We'll hear from you, Mr. Cleek."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1699.414,1703.255,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1732.146,1734.687,May I just ask for a clarification?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1745.223,1745.754,--That's right.
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1750.239,1763.555,"And is... that would be rather strange, wouldn't it, to say these officials, who were clearly acting in their official capacity in having a fire code and a cease and desist order, that they were doing something in their personal capacities?"
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1763.555,1778.706,"I believe, Your Honor, that that's the only way a damage claim could have been returned in this case, in view of the rule of the Eleventh Amendment, and nonetheless those claims were made, punitive and compensatory damage claims were made in the original complaint and the amended complaint."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1783.859,1785.191,And on what ground were they dismissed?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1785.191,1788.523,--They were dismissed by a voluntary action of the plaintiff.
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1790.603,1792.825,You hadn't put in a defense to it?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1792.825,1795.857,To the damage claims?
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1795.857,1796.338,Yes.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1796.338,1797.826,"Those had not been addressed, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1810.265,1811.196,"I mean, an answer."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1818.26,1818.54,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1818.54,1819.542,--against the defendants.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1821.473,1822.174,"Yes, ma'am."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1822.174,1822.645,--to that claim?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1822.645,1823.125,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1823.125,1824.237,And what was the answer?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1824.237,1829.279,We denied that there was... it was a denial that there were any damages due.
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1829.279,1834.302,"On what ground, because this was a claim about State action."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1834.302,1848.96,"There was an Eleventh Amendment defense asserted, but with regard to those damage claims, I assumed, from reading the complaint, that they were against individuals in their personal capacity, otherwise they couldn't be returnable against the State."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1848.96,1859.118,"I don't want to deflect you on this, but to the extent that they were seeking injunctive relief it was a pure Ex parte Young case?"
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1859.118,1869.645,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and let me respond for a moment about the issue about the intrusion into legislative prerogative here that this catalyst theory may engender."
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.896,1924.861,"Mr. Cleek, Mr. Arceneaux was queried extensively about some of the practical problems with his position."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1960.404,1962.337,There are two means--
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.337,1963.085,Attorneys' fees payable?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1963.426,1966.019,"--Two means to address that issue, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.842,1973.173,Yes.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1973.173,1979.116,"--just enforcement of this regulation, or whatever, does not moot the case, then you can proceed to merits."
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.116,1980.028,"Oh, no, it moots the case."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,1982.329,2002.691,"In that case, that is the one area in which it would appear that unless Congress has approved the catalyst theory, assuming the catalyst theory is the only means of addressing that mootness issue, unless Congress has approved the catalyst theory, there's no relief there."
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.691,2003.693,Okay.
2000.99-1848,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2003.693,2028.138,"The problem goes one step further, doesn't it, because we have indicated that settlements may qualify, a settled case may have a prevailing party within the meaning of the rule, and I would suppose that if you prevail in any case in which the settlement would otherwise give the plaintiff the relief that the plaintiff was seeking, there just won't be any more settlements."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2042.929,2055.688,"Your Honor, this Court has recognized in Maher and Farrar as well, and also it's indicated in the legislative history, that settlements constitute prevailing party status."
2000.99-1848,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2074.428,2103.948,"Well, it's not going to cut down on settlements in which in effect they in some ways split the difference, but when, in fact, you have a case that traditionally would have resulted in a settlement, there would be an orderly process, they'd sign a neither party docket marking, whatever, and give it to the judge, the judge would approve it, and the defendant agrees in that kind... in a settled case to provide exactly what the plaintiff wants, there'll be no more settlements."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2110.943,2126.812,"--It could affect, in candor, a settlement where a regulation is involved or where a policy is involved, because in that case it is arguable that the governmental body could simply stop the conduct and moot the case."
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.812,2133.246,"Well, how many settlements are you aware of that are not split-the-difference settlements?"
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2139.84,2140.471,Your Honor--
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.471,2146.364,"In my experience, at least, when you sign a settlement agreement you get something in exchange for that settlement agreement."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2152.119,2164.396,"--I have been litigating these cases for 27 years, even before the Attorneys' Fees Act, and I have not had the occasion to see any cases where they weren't--"
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.396,2165.748,"Well, isn't this such a case?"
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2168.771,2170.07,--This is an example of it--
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.07,2171.472,The State totally abandoned its position.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2171.472,2172.042,--Yes.
2000.99-1848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.404,2236.665,"Well, if you say... if we're at that point, that is, if you agree... given your answer to Justice Scalia I think you do agree that if you look at the practicalities, for every bad thing you can find one side you can find a bad thing the other side."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2295.643,2297.684,"Your Honor, you're quite right."
2000.99-1848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.008,2333.598,What about the House report?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2379.6,2384.832,"Your Honor, I think that you're wrong for this reason."
2000.99-1848,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2424.259,2426.31,"Mr. Cleek, I'm not--"
2000.99-1848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2426.31,2445.172,"--Well, in looking... right in this, where it says voluntarily ceasing, I didn't think it was formal, but then I thought many of these statutes were passed at a time where civil rights violations all over the country were common, and many of the statutes were passed to end widespread violations of civil rights."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2464.684,2465.345,"All right, sir."
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.73,2526.634,"Mr. Cleek, I'm not a big fan of attributing a House report to the entire Congress."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2589.399,2598.145,"--Your Honor, I think that you can do that, and as a matter of fact it makes eminent good sense, because otherwise the use of unlawful would have been unnecessary."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2598.145,2622.431,"But the dividing line that you put with a settlement... now, a settlement, many of these settlements, am I not right, say, I don't admit that I did one thing wrong, but I'm settling this lawsuit, and the Congress would make a distinction between that kind of settlement just because it's on a piece of paper filed in court, where the defendant said, I am paying the plaintiff out of the goodness of my heart, but we were never any wrongdoers."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2634.519,2653.87,"Your Honor, that argument has been made by the petitioners and their amici in this case, and what I think you're suggesting is, if you have a settlement that Congress has recognized and this Court has recognized grants prevailing party status, then if you have a voluntary act that affords the same sort of relief, how is that any different."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2666.299,2669.432,"Well, that means that the causation problem is not a problem."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2687.983,2694.027,"--Your Honor, the only way I can respond to that sensibly is that Congress had the right to choose."
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.217,2703.923,Why couldn't you respond to it by saying that where you have a written settlement you don't have to acknowledge liability because the written settlement is what ties it to the litigation?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2721.645,2723.097,That would be correct.
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.097,2736.057,"Whereas just stopping it, without any acknowledgement that what you were doing was wrong, you have no idea whether the litigation was what produced it, or whether the West Virginia legislature just decided this was a stupid law, which is frankly what I think it thought."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2736.057,2741.3,"Your Honor, and let me follow up that with this comment."
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.811,2777.193,"May I interrupt you, Mr. Cleek?"
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2794.784,2795.515,"--Yes, I would."
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2795.515,2795.944,Isn't that right?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2795.944,2798.525,"Yes, I would, and the reason, Your Honor, is, that I believe--"
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.525,2806.412,"So that it is not important for us to decide whether the legislature has to be involved, because your theory doesn't really depend on legislative action."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2808.565,2847.759,"--I think, Your Honor, that the only reason this Court should address the legislative difficulties and the concerns about intrusions into the motivations of legislators is that that is such an important issue that if the Court accepts the catalyst theory that if there's an exception to be made for that area, then it ought to be made, but with regard to your first question about whether or not, if the fire marshal had simply changed the rule and been motivated by the lawsuit there would have been recovery, the answer is still no, because the catalyst theory is not recognized, in our view, under the prevailing party designation in 1988 or any of the other fee-shifting statutes."
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.48,2849.121,"No, I understand your position."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2898.913,2904.698,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that at all, and I think that I addressed that issue earlier with--"
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2904.698,2908.82,"You say read a lot of other cases and read it in context, is what your answer is."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2908.82,2913.855,--That is the only means that I can address that language and explain it.
2000.99-1848,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2936.669,2937.91,Wasn't that language dicta?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2937.91,2939.321,"It was, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2968.16,2968.971,"Well, it wasn't at issue."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2987.794,2990.084,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2990.084,2992.768,But there was no doubt that there was a prevailing party in that case.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,2992.768,3031.333,"In fact, this Court found that they were a prevailing party because even the $1 caused a change in the legal relationship between the parties, because the defendant had to pay something to the plaintiff he otherwise wouldn't have had to pay, but Farrar still... and you know, if we have dicta in Hewitt, and dicta in Farrar, both sides are arguing that they have some value, but if we look at Farrar just for the purpose of establishing what this Court said is a definition of the parameters of prevailing party, if we look at it just for that purpose alone, then I think that the argument that we made that it's not consistent with the catalyst theory is very easily made and very easily understood."
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3033.835,3044.28,"Well, I thought you accepted that this Court had said in Friends of the Earth that the catalyst theory remained an open question and that Farrar did not deal with it."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3047.183,3047.473,--Yes.
2000.99-1848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3047.473,3048.304,--you were quarreling with that.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3048.304,3050.024,I'm not quarreling with that.
2000.99-1848,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3068.346,3076.932,--simply whether or not someone who received the nominal damages a prevailing party?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3076.932,3078.574,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3078.574,3079.884,Okay.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3079.884,3082.685,And the Court found that they were a prevailing party--
2000.99-1848,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3082.685,3085.377,And the holding below was that they were not a prevailing party?
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3085.377,3098.686,"--That's correct and, of course, the Court continued to say that under those circumstances, even to be given that designation was insufficient to award fees, because there were just some cases where there was no entitlement."
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.686,3100.576,Refresh my memory.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3104.11,3106.391,"You reversed the lower court, I believe, Your Honor."
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.391,3110.264,"We held there was a prevailing party, but didn't we say there were no fees that were due?"
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3110.264,3118.261,"That's correct, and I think what the lower court had said, that there wasn't prevailing party status, that's my recollection, and there was some difference there."
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.928,3131.859,"The lower court found no entitlement, why?"
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3134.721,3136.591,"--It seems to me, Your Honor, in Farrar that--"
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.591,3138.233,Because not a prevailing party.
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3138.233,3140.024,"--Right, that it was just such a--"
2000.99-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.024,3142.405,And we found no entitlement because why?
2000.99-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.947,3147.349,--Didn't prevail enough.
2000.99-1848,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3148.909,3155.695,"No, we found that they were a prevailing party but there was nominal damages, so the attorneys' fees were reduced."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3157.545,3159.057,--It was a de minimis--
2000.99-1848,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3159.057,3163.579,"--and we said it was not because they were not a prevailing party, but rather that it was nominal damages."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3163.579,3164.23,--That's correct.
2000.99-1848,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3164.23,3164.961,"Thank you, Mr. Cleek."
2000.99-1848,2,20685,david_p_cleek,,3164.961,3165.912,"Thank you, Your Honor."
