1985.85-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.404,We will hear arguments next in Arcara against Cloud Books.
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,96.562,112.339,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the present case on a writ of certiorari to the New York Court of Appeals stems from an action under New York's public health law to abate a nuisance allegedly occurring at respondent's book store premises."
1985.85-437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.989,226.059,"Mr. DeFranks, would you mind explaining how New York interprets this law?"
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,239.867,240.653,"No, it would not."
1985.85-437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.859,257.663,And does the prosecutor have an option to seek closure or an injunction?
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,257.663,265.768,"No, under the law the closure is mandatory at the conclusion of a successful prosecution."
1985.85-437,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,269.386,273.14,"Well, did the prosecutor in this case try to get an injunction?"
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,273.14,287.015,"The prosecutor in this case commenced the action, and the case was dismissed prior to the trial, but in our complaint we sought injunction and closure, hot the two come together as part of the law."
1985.85-437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.015,289.05,But your injunction was to close.
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,289.05,290.35,"Yes, that's correct."
1985.85-437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,292.036,294.704,It wasn't just to stop the--
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,294.704,295.238,Correct.
1985.85-437,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.238,297.09,--the illegal conduct.
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,297.09,297.822,Correct.
1985.85-437,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,329.377,330.444,May I ask a question there?
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,346.12,347.422,Could we close down the premises?
1985.85-437,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,347.422,347.788,Yes.
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,347.788,348.488,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-437,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,348.488,351.54,Even if they are publishing a newspaper or magazine?
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,351.54,352.057,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.646,361.765,And whether or not the owner knew of the activity?
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,361.765,372.388,"Yes, the law does not indicate that there has to be knowledge by the owner, but only that the premises is being used for the conduct."
1985.85-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,377.006,380.808,"Must this be open and notorious use, or--"
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,380.808,381.994,"Well, in this case--"
1985.85-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,381.994,383.294,--standard there?
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,383.294,401.907,"--In this case it was a premises open to the public, so in this case it was open and notorious, because the undercover officer was able to observe it from the position he was in which was in the area of the movie projectors, the booths."
1985.85-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.101,532.672,"Mr. DeFranks, let me go back to a point that was raised a couple moments ago."
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,537.976,538.792,Yes.
1985.85-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.726,548.597,And what happened was that the appellate courts in New York upheld kind of a demur to the complaint or whatever you want to call it?
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,548.597,549.866,A motion for summary judgment.
1985.85-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.866,557.889,A motion for... and the district attorney's allegations in this case were that the defendant was aware of what was going on in the store?
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,557.889,558.205,Correct.
1985.85-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.205,561.924,"So for purposes or the case before us, we assume that those were the facts."
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,561.924,570.88,"Right, in this particular case, and it was very clear that the managers and higher ranking officials with the company were well aware of what was going on."
1985.85-437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,577.867,579.084,Those are the allegations.
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,579.084,582.336,--Those are the allegations in the complaint.
1985.85-437,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,622.563,632.87,"You take the position that it isn't a First Amendment case at all, so we wouldn't be concerned with narrowly tailored or substantial interests?"
1985.85-437,0,30198,john_j_de_franks,,632.87,633.053,--Exactly.
1985.85-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,803.376,809.798,Very well.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,811.415,822.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, initially I think that it is important to again emphasize the record that we come up here on."
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,886.548,888.048,May I ask this question?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,888.048,888.532,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,888.532,889.717,Am I mistaken?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,899.623,902.408,That is the way the statute is written.
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,902.408,902.958,Yes.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,902.958,919.453,"And the way it has teen applied by the Court of Appeals is to make this a permissive rather than a mandatory closure, and the reason that that was done was to say that based on this record, this would not be justified."
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,946.337,956.943,"But your opponent here says that the New York statutory scheme does not give trial courts that sort of discretion here, that upon a showing of this kind, closure is mandatory."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,958.145,977.289,"That is what the statute says literally, and the way that the Court of Appeals interpreted that to be permissive versus mandatory was to analyze the record, analyze the law from this Court and from the state court and make the determination that--"
1985.85-437,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,977.289,990.616,"The court below, as I understand it, said the First Amendment in effect forced it to make that decision, because it thought there were First Amendment values at stake here."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,991.332,992.832,--I think that is partly right.
1985.85-437,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.664,1073.001,Do you think the sane analysis would be required if a bookstore were closed because of violation of some safety--
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1073.001,1076.369,"--No, and I think there is an obvious distinction there, and that is this."
1985.85-437,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1103.353,1103.87,"--Well, but hoe wait a minute."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1115.011,1126.135,"--I think the point there is what the city would say is that the least you can do to comply with our noncontent legislation here is to correct X, Y, and Z fire code."
1985.85-437,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1146.597,1150.251,But you are assuming it is a First Amendment case.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1150.251,1153.036,"And I think for good reason, and I might say this is the reason."
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.312,1256.084,"This would be true in your view even if it were the application of a city fire ordinance to all buildings of a certain kind, and one building fulled out to be a bookstore?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1256.084,1259.888,I think that if we had a situation where--
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1259.888,1261.021,Answer my question.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1261.021,1262.94,--I am attempting to answer your question.
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.077,1276.148,"Is my example a kind of speech, legislation that could affect speech directly, in your words?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1276.148,1277.85,"It could affect speech directly, yes."
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1283.087,1289.49,But the hypothetical I gave you was an ordinance which applied fire regulations to all buildings of a certain kind--
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1289.49,1289.89,--Yes.
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1289.89,1290.59,--including a book store.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1290.59,1295.561,"Yes, I think fire would be analogous to zoning, and we could make the same argument."
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.632,1309.036,"And does the application of a fire ordinance to a building in which there is a book store affect that area of speech, as you put it?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1309.036,1311.154,--I think it would depend on what the ordinance said.
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.154,1318.427,"The ordinance says you have to have a certain fire resistant break on the outside, you have to have smoke detectors on the inside, that sort of thing?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1318.427,1319.91,"No, I don't think that would be true."
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.706,1369.109,"Suppose there is no bookstore involved, and you just have a house of prostitution."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1373.661,1381.167,--I don't know basically what the purpose would be unless we had the facts before us to see.
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.9,1392.558,"Well, here is a nuisance, here is a public nuisance ordinance that allows the city to close down the use of that property for a year for anything."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1392.558,1393.042,--Yes.
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.042,1393.875,Isn't that right?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1393.875,1395.427,That's exactly what the legislation said.
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.427,1400.879,I would suppose it is some sort of deterrence--
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1400.879,1401.747,But isn't--
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.747,1406.216,--to prevent... to convince people that they shouldn't run houses of prostitution.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1406.216,1409.668,"--But, Justice White, isn't the point here in this case--"
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.668,1411.953,I am just talking... just answer... how about my question?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1414.572,1417.59,"--I think depending upon the record, I would agree."
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.59,1419.625,--they want to make it expensive to run houses of prostitution?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1419.625,1422.077,"Depending upon the facts in the record, yes."
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.077,1427.981,"And you say that the operator of a house of prostitution can avoid that deterrent effect by selling books, too."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1427.981,1428.948,"Oh, no, I never--"
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.948,1430.214,"Well, that is your argument."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1430.214,1432.183,"--Not at any time, because, you see--"
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1432.183,1436.152,"Well, here is a house of prostitution, and he also runs a bookstore."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1442.991,1443.324,--No.
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.324,1446.693,--you couldn't... you would have to let the bookstore run.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1446.693,1455.632,What I am saying is that you could definitely close the house of prostitution or the prostitution... and the Court of Appeals has said the same thing.
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.632,1464.904,"Yes, but housing the... closing the... without the bookstore you could close down the property and it couldn't be used for anything for a year."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1464.904,1465.654,What I am saying--
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.654,1471.141,With the bookstore you say the property cannot be closed down for a year.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1471.141,1477.212,"--What I am saying is, again, depending upon the facts, the remedy has to fit the problem."
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1497.875,1500.458,Then are you arguing this is a violation of the Eighth Amendment?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1504.029,1510.266,"I think that it clearly is too excessive under the First Amendment, because what it amounts to is, it is an overkill."
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1511.216,1514.985,What in the First Amendment talks about penalties?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1514.985,1516.42,--Nothing.
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1516.42,1516.987,Then--
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1516.987,1518.889,"As far as penalty, Your Honor, it simply--"
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1518.889,1520.539,"--This is a penalty, isn't it?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1520.539,1526.193,"--indicates that it can't be abridged, that it can't be suppressed, and that is what this is."
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.289,1597.839,You say there is a provision for an injunction in the statute?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1597.839,1599.341,"Yes, there is in the statute a provision."
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1632.462,1637.966,"And they did that because they thought the First Amendment to the United States Constitution required it, didn't they?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1637.966,1645.722,I think that that... and the way they interpreted their legislation that it did not require closure regardless of the facts.
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.722,1658.629,"Let me read this statement to you from the New York Court of Appeals opinion on Page A-19 of the petition, where just before they reached the end and Judge Jason starts dissenting, the Court of Appeals says,"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1672.705,1677.943,"Yes, and I think the key phrase begins off with ""Under these circumstances""."
1985.85-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.943,1683.411,"Yes, and under these circumstances they felt the legislation could not be constitutionally applied."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1683.411,1687.315,"Under these circumstances, because it wasn't the narrowest means available."
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1772.405,1774.621,May I interrupt to ask this question?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1796.77,1805.709,"If I might say, I think if we look at the Committee for Creative Nonviolence case, there the question was whether sleeping was prohibited."
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1805.709,1807.226,"That was conduct, wasn't it?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1807.226,1814.815,"And that was simply conduct, and in that case I think the Chief Justice indicated conduct is not talking or not speech."
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1814.815,1817.017,Conduct in Lafayette Park.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1817.017,1847.369,"Yes, and in this particular case we have pure speech, admittedly pure speech being detrimentally affected when it doesn't have to be, and the purpose of the statute can still be furthered simply by the injunction, and if it is not, if it is not, then the cases cited by the Court of Appeals in their decision, Croaton and Allouwill and so on, in those cases, the record there demonstrated there should be a closure."
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1847.369,1848.285,May I ask this question?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1850.487,1852.337,The statute on its face doesn't--
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1852.337,1853.606,Had nothing whatever to do with--
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1853.606,1854.806,--say anything one way or the other.
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1854.806,1855.406,--Yes.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1855.406,1861.593,"And there are a number of statutes that have been neutral, but nevertheless this Court has applied the balancing test."
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1861.593,1864.295,Never where there is conduct unrelated to speech.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1867.764,1870.065,Never where conduct unrelated to speech.
1985.85-437,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1870.065,1875.033,Where the only issue was conducted unrelated to speech.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1875.033,1879.754,"If we had... no, I agree."
1985.85-437,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.138,1945.113,"Well, Mr. Cambria, suppose we had a policeman who arrested a television anchorperson for speeding or drunk driving just before the evening broadcast."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1953.802,1980.369,"--No, and if, however, there was a law that said that if you are convicted of speeding or arrested for speeding, then you cannot act as an anchorperson for a year after that time, then I would submit we are involved in an overly broad regulation, because in the case you pose, the thing that needs to be addressed is the actual conduct that is against the law, and I think that is what the Court of Appeals has said here."
1985.85-437,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1988.142,1999.95,"Well, but the policeman would have an option to issue a citation at the moment and release the anchorperson to go make the broadcast, or to keep the person under arrest and prevent it."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,1999.95,2010.806,"But, Your Honor, if I might, I don't see how that is analogous to this situation, where the problem is, it is the closure order that we are dealing with and not the restraint."
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.998,2030.052,Does this penalty run against a person or a building?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2030.052,2039.158,"It runs against the premises, and the people punished are the people who have control and ownership of the premises, including corporate officers and so on."
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.86,2046.145,He could go and rent another place and engage in these alleged First Amendment activities.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2046.145,2051.799,"--I submit, Your Honor, that there has been no proof of that and no allegation of that in this case."
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2051.799,2052.482,Is it a fact?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2052.482,2054.417,It is not a fact.
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.619,2060.837,You say it is not a fact that they aren't free to rent another building?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2060.837,2062.606,"Not in this community, they are not."
1985.85-437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.18,2204.549,"Mr. Cambria, may I ask you a question?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2208.668,2209.034,Yes.
1985.85-437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.034,2225.229,"Supposing when you go back, the city, even though it hasn't alleged it yet, does put in proof that establishes beyond a reasonable doubt, A, that you could move across the street, and you deny you could, and B, that there is no other remedy that would effectively prevent the nuisance from reoccuring."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2227.095,2230.866,"I think if they allege that, if we had another lawsuit, yes."
1985.85-437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2230.866,2235.335,"Well, as part of this, I assume they are not old common law pleading."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2243.257,2243.724,Yes.
1985.85-437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.724,2251.53,"--So what I am really suggesting is, do we know on the record before us what the issue is going to be at the time the remedy is imposed?"
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2251.53,2253.63,I think yes and no.
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.568,2318.489,"I thought the law that the District Attorney was faced with, though, wouldn't permit him just to get an injunction."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2318.489,2321.341,"They... no, I don't believe that is true at all."
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.315,2333.348,Did they try to get an injunction?
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2333.348,2341.587,"--Yes, and what the trial court found was that they didn't demonstrate that there were not adequate legal remedies, that in addition they didn't--"
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.587,2344.389,"Well, on that basis you would never get an injunction."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2344.389,2345.972,"--No, I submit no, Your Honor."
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.241,2352.228,"Well, why, if there are adequate legal remedies like indicting somebody."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2355.097,2359.149,"--Your Honor, in the Village of Schaumberg case, which you wrote the decision in--"
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.149,2360.499,--That was a Court opinion.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2360.499,2377.843,"--you looked to the fact of using penal laws in an area for lesser or more direct means than using equitable remedies, or using other remedies that weren't as narrow, and I submit they legitimately did that here, and further, I submit this, that if they demonstrated below--"
1985.85-437,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.843,2382.414,"The District Attorney tried to get an injunction, and the court wouldn't give it to him."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2382.414,2400.559,"--Because they didn't have a sufficient showing, not that it wouldn't be proper with a sufficient showing, but they didn't have a sufficient legal showing, and the decision is here from the lower court about the fact of the hearsay nature of it and the fact that they tried never to have an arrest... I mean, in these other cases we look at Croaton and Allouwill and so on."
1985.85-437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.841,2464.532,"But I guess it is their legal position that they don't have to show that it is necessary or that there is some other place you can move if the statute means what it says, and closure follows automatically from proof of this kind of activity."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2464.532,2465.484,"--Well, but I don't think that's--"
1985.85-437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.484,2466.384,That's their legal position.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2466.384,2475.757,"--I don't think that's... they have not said that, because they would have to allege it so that we could at least deny it, so that then there would be an issue of fact foe someone to--"
1985.85-437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.757,2478.626,"No, they can just say the statute means what it says."
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2478.626,2479.526,--The statute simply says--
1985.85-437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.526,2480.678,And the Court of Appeals said it did.
1985.85-437,1,37769,paul_j_cambria_jr,,2483.612,2489.349,"--Right, the statute says there is one and only one remedy basically no matter what the facts are, and I submit that is the problem here."
1985.85-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.989,2582.691,"Do you have anything further, Mr. DeFranks?"
1985.85-437,2,30198,john_j_de_franks,,2582.691,2584.477,"Just one thing, Your Honor."
1985.85-437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2598.385,2598.851,Wait.
1985.85-437,2,30198,john_j_de_franks,,2608.29,2610.658,"On a first analysis, correct."
1985.85-437,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.658,2615.193,"So it seems to me that you should he saying to us, don't bother looking at alternatives."
1985.85-437,2,30198,john_j_de_franks,,2619.514,2619.88,Right.
1985.85-437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2626.168,2628.134,"Thank you, gentlemen."
