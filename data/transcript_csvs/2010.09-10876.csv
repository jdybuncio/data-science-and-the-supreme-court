2010.09-10876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.654,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-10876, Bullcoming v. New Mexico."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,7.637,10.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-10876,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,68.441,89.522,"Mr. Fisher, when you say ""in the presence"", do you -- do you mean it necessarily must be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing set-up be permissible so that the technician or the analyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it would be screened in -- in the courthouse?"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,89.522,94.39,"Well, the default rule under the Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the courtroom."
2010.09-10876,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,116.505,124.593,"The defendant didn't give his consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,127.897,137.919,"--I don't think it would be adequate, Justice Ginsburg, with at least some -- absent at least some showing of unavailability of the witness or -- making the witness unable to come to court."
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,148.358,149.541,What about police witnesses?
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,164.652,165.836,"Well, that's never been--"
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,165.836,166.686,Can't make it.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,170.021,173.425,"--That's never been the rule, Justice Scalia, and I don't think there would be a need to--"
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.425,175.475,Why -- why is a lab technician different?
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,175.475,184.214,"--I don't think -- I don't think one is, and you don't have to reach that in this case, because the State never attempted to make any showing that Mr. Caylor was unavailable for any reason."
2010.09-10876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,184.464,188.435,"Mr. Fisher, what if you had two people doing this procedure?"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,202.743,206.73,--Only if the State wants to present statements from them both.
2010.09-10876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,206.73,207.513,"No, they want to--"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,207.513,208.13,They both--
2010.09-10876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,208.13,211.264,--They want to present the results of the blood analysis--
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,211.264,211.714,--I think--
2010.09-10876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,211.714,213.133,--the numbers the machine spits out.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,213.133,219.637,"--I think in that scenario, if both people were there for the whole thing, the State could have either one of them testify."
2010.09-10876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,221.387,221.987,Even though one--
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,221.987,222.353,--and this is the rule--
2010.09-10876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,222.353,223.422,--Even though one didn't do it?
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,230.243,230.559,--That's right.
2010.09-10876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,233.761,233.927,I'm sorry.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,236.327,237.713,They do not have to.
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.126,260.342,I -- I don't understand that.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,269.915,273.969,"--Again, the question, Justice Kennedy, is not who the State has to bring in."
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,281.806,286.777,"What the State wanted to introduce is the result of the exam, and the Chief Justice gives you the hypothetical."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,291.014,293.966,--If only -- if the State is only introducing one person--
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.966,301.036,But it -- but it's hearsay as to what the first person did with -- with crimping--
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,301.036,303.905,--I don't--
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,303.905,306.94,--crimping the thing.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,320.681,323.133,"--No, I -- Justice Kennedy, I don't think it's hearsay."
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.748,345.864,"The State takes its chances, right?"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,349.933,350.385,--That's right.
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,355.52,357.456,You always take your chances with a business record.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,372.232,384.706,"--I'm not sure I -- I disagree with anything you said, but the rule of the Confrontation Clause applies to a particular kind of statements, testimonial statements."
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.712,401.735,"Now, I take it it's a testimonial statement that this blood that was taken at the hospital was the blood of the defendant."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,403.018,405.684,"--Yes, I believe it would be, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.684,412.29,"And so I assume that in this case, the nurse and the police officer were both present."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,412.29,413.39,"Yes, and, in fact--"
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,413.39,428.732,"But I assume under your position, you could not have a record showing that the -- the nurse withdrew the sample at 10:08 p.m. on such-and-such a date and that she followed the regular procedure."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,436.653,439.003,--I think that's what footnote 1 in Melendez-Diaz says.
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,447.573,449.875,"Well, that's not -- I don't think that's what Melendez-Diaz' footnote 1 says."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,466.417,467.1,--I think that's right.
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.673,475.606,It does -- it does not--
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.606,498.622,"Does not Melendez-Diaz also say that if the defendant wants to challenge the -- the chain of custody, the State can adopt rules that requires the defendant to assert that challenge or his intention to make that challenge, or his intention to make that challenge, prior to the trial so that the State will know whether it has to introduce any live testimony?"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,498.622,503.092,"Of course, that's correct under the notice and demand regimes that Melendez-Diaz approved of."
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.929,518.618,"--But the chain -- the chain of custody does involve a testimonial statement that this is the blood, that I took it out at 10:05 p.m. on Saturday evening."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,520.651,526.772,"--Yes, it can, Justice Kennedy, but chain of custody is proved by live witnesses every day in -- every day in courtrooms across the country--"
2010.09-10876,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.772,528.39,But it's not just--
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,528.39,529.39,--long before Melendez-Diaz or Crawford.
2010.09-10876,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.39,531.342,--It's not just chain of custody.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,602.521,627.969,"If I understand your hypothetical correctly, I think that if the defendant wanted -- the defendant can certainly make that argument to a jury, and the defendant, if he wanted to insist -- if the prosecution wanted to tie the results -- let's bring it back to the facts of this case -- wanted to tie the.21 to Mr. Bullcoming by saying that was Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then they'd need to bring somebody into court if the defendant insisted upon it."
2010.09-10876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,647.633,653.351,"Well, but if you want to tell us, don't worry, it won't happen, I think that's an unacceptable argument."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,675.033,694.328,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I will gladly accept (b) if we want to say that consequences are irrelevant, because I think that's what -- the Sixth Amendment is what it is, but I think the only thing I would add is that all I can say is, empirically, in the States that have followed the rule we advocate today, long before Crawford or Melendez-Diaz, it simply is a manageable burden."
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.897,701.082,"Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I thought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,704.201,708.004,"--Well, I think it was raised even more pointedly in Melendez-Diaz when it comes to lab analysts."
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.289,719.526,"Said, yes, it may be something of a risk, but the States have managed it in the past, and there's no reason to think they can't manage it in the future."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,719.526,721.978,I think that's what Melendez-Diaz--
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,721.978,730.667,"Counsel, there are different types of hearsay involved here or different types of statements."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,754.449,755.416,--Yes.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,755.416,757.084,The witness is not at trial here.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,757.084,765.738,"Yes, Mr. Caylor's certifications in this -- in the lab report, not only that the blood -- that the blood had a.21 blood alcohol content, but also that--"
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,765.738,766.54,"Well, that's where I want--"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,766.54,767.023,"--Oh, but--"
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,767.023,775.896,"--That -- the ""also"" is what I summarized in saying that he followed certain procedures, that it was in accordance with law, et cetera."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,775.896,780.197,--And also that it was Mr. Bullcoming's blood sample and that the sample had not been tampered with.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,780.197,780.63,Right.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,780.63,781.413,That's the totality of the--
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,781.413,781.799,All right.
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,781.799,783.049,But as to those persons who--
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,783.049,784.482,Now -- if I might just finish my question.
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,784.482,784.715,--Okay.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.399,805.295,"Let's assume that the raw data, the graphs that were made, were reviewed by a separate witness, and he reviewed the data and says, this data shows that the blood level concentration was.21, or two-point whatever it was."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,810.866,814.901,"--I want to be clear that raw -- by ""raw data"", you mean the printout from a machine?"
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,814.901,816.27,The printout from the machine.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,816.27,817.17,It's used a few different ways in the briefing.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.17,818.972,That wasn't introduced here; am I correct?
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,818.972,823.84,"It was neither -- it was not introduced, and there's nothing in the record to show that Mr. Razatos even reviewed it."
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,823.84,824.357,All right.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,825.69,826.323,So what he did is just read the report.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,826.323,828.809,--Let's assume he just took the raw data at trial.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,835.563,835.763,Right.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,835.763,837.098,--to Mr. Bullcoming.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,848.988,849.838,Probably not.
2010.09-10876,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,861.546,865.665,"And that's what -- that's the New Mexico Supreme Court suggested, didn't they?"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,905.925,907.325,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.248,970.184,What part--
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,970.184,970.9,--Confrontation Clause problem.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,970.9,972.384,--What part do you see as testimonial or not?
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,975.319,977.171,I think an expert can look at anything.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,982.223,982.49,"Well, I -- that--"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,982.49,984.425,--barring an expert from reviewing whatever he wants.
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,984.425,993.881,"--There's two different issues: one, what can be introduced into evidence, which is the reports themselves; and what can he or she testify to is a different question."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1007.124,1016.146,"In one of two scenarios, Justice Sotomayor, the first which is the scenario we have in this case, when the report is introduced and it's testimonial."
2010.09-10876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1017.029,1018.681,Let's assume the hypothetical I proffered.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1018.681,1020.115,--The second is that it's not introduced.
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1029.971,1031.756,Could we break this down in -- in this way?
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1054.236,1057.938,"--I think there's one other thing, Justice Alito, which is that the sample had not been tampered with--"
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1057.938,1058.254,All right.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1058.254,1059.221,--or contaminated.
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1059.221,1059.938,That the sample had not been tampered with.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1083.838,1086.873,"I think that would be a question of State law, Justice Alito."
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1086.873,1088.207,It wouldn't be a Confrontation--
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1088.207,1089.373,It wouldn't be a Confrontation Clause question.
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1089.373,1089.909,--All right.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1148.429,1166.223,"Justice Alito, I think if you look earlier in the Joint Appendix, I believe it's at page 40, where the State for the first time says we're going to put Mr. Razatos on the stand instead of Mr. Caylor, there's a -- there's an objection there as well that says you can't then put the document into evidence that Mr. Caylor wrote if he's not going to be on the stand."
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1230.147,1245.223,"But if the -- if the machine had expelled a piece of paper that said.21, that piece of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be a violation of the Confrontation Clause?"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1245.223,1248.96,"If it said nothing more than the.21 coming out of the machine, I think probably not."
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1257.733,1258.716,"Well, how can -- how can you debate it?"
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1263.887,1269.791,"Well -- well, the question that would arise there would be whether the.21 should be treated as Mr. Caylor's statement."
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1318.769,1328.226,"But all of those other things could potentially be proven by indirect evidence, by establishing standard procedures and asking the jury to infer that the standard procedures were followed in this case."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1330.276,1330.71,The State could--

2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1331.862,1350.057,"--The State could make that choice, but it would be a considerably weaker case, Justice Alito, not just because they wouldn't have anyone saying that the procedures were actually followed in this case, but also in this case it would be a far weaker case because they'd have somebody on the stand who would now be subject to cross-examination as to why he had been recently put on unpaid leave."
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1350.057,1359.846,"But as to this case, didn't the defendant actually testify that he was drunk at the time of -- at the time when the blood was extracted?"

2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1374.005,1374.689,Isn't that correct?

2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1441.429,1441.964,But the State can't--
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1441.964,1442.431,And--
2010.09-10876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1442.431,1445.75,--The State can't immunize those people from testifying.
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1457.823,1462.375,"--Well, we -- we could have, but Melendez-Diaz makes clear that doesn't satisfy the Confrontation Clause."
2010.09-10876,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.302,1529.333,"How do you answer the practical situation that Caylor, who did this particular run, does some dozens day in and day out, and he will have no memory, in fact, of this particular test."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1547.462,1553.949,"Let me give you two answers, Justice Ginsburg, but first let me say we don't know whether somebody doesn't remember it until he's put on the stand."
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.904,1569.791,Wasn't it the case that these tests are unusual in this particular jurisdiction?
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1569.791,1571.074,"--That's my understanding, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-10876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1597.709,1602.863,"Well, I assume that even if he doesn't remember, his testimony is not worthless to the prosecution."
2010.09-10876,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1617.605,1619.338,"--Of course, it can, Justice Scalia."

2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,1720.07,1721.672,"--It is not my point, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1738.364,1741.483,"I'm sorry, could you tell me what that means?"
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,1764.082,1772.871,"--Your Honor, and I understand, and I'll answer your question with regard to your expectation that the certification is the same as the affidavit."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1776.389,1777.758,Tell me why not.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,1777.758,1786.412,--There are other distinguishing -- distinguishing features that are significant between the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this case.
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1824.989,1825.506,Can any--
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.506,1829.608,"And that was prepared just for fun, not for use in trial?"
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,1829.608,1830.81,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.714,1846.253,So what difference does it make whether the statute requires it to be taken to be used at trial or whether the police send it over to be used at trial as a use of the State?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,1847.37,1864.114,"--Your Honor, I think the key is to look at the purpose of the analyst who was preparing the report, who is a public employee, who is just carrying out, as our court said, copying the information from the machine onto the report."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1870.601,1871.168,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,1890.765,1892.115,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1917.999,1932.008,"Isn't the difference between those two documents is that one was prepared primarily for the purposes -- this lab report, for prosecution purposes, and the birth certificate is not prepared for that?"
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,1939.179,1943.233,"--That is correct with regard to the birth -- birth certificate, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1943.233,1951.32,So tell me what makes this certificate not primarily for the purpose of use in the prosecution of an individual?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,1955.791,1958.826,"Your Honor, in -- in this case, no."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2010.426,2014.478,Does he do any testing except for the police?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2014.478,2015.344,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2015.344,2017.245,Who else do they test for?

2010.09-10876,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2038.326,2045.849,Are these lab analysts civil service employees?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2050.901,2051.753,"Yes, Your Honor, they are."
2010.09-10876,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2054.086,2070.964,Is there any way in which your office or prosecutors or the police could cause them not to get promotions if they weren't producing the kind of lab reports that the police and the prosecution might like?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2070.964,2072.499,"No, Your Honor, they could not."

2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.28,2099.196,On leave without pay?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2099.196,2099.596,--Uh-huh.
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.596,2101.582,And do we know why it was leave without pay?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2101.582,2102.848,"We don't know why, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2102.848,2105.6,Does the defense know why it was leave without pay?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2120.277,2124.931,"Your Honor, I -- I think that the defense would like to know the answer to that question."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.931,2133.704,"And didn't -- and didn't the prosecution intentionally set it up this way so that this person would not have to testify, so that he could not be cross-examined?"
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2136.27,2137.988,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.037,2164.739,"I don't know what the facts are, but boy, it smells bad to me."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2179.082,2192.39,"--Your Honor, I think that the key here is that if you would not look at the -- at any of the qualities of the declarant in deciding whether the statement is testimonial or not."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.322,2231.847,"I agree that whether it's testimonial does not depend upon whether there's skullduggery or not, but the possibility of skullduggery, even in machine -- machine situations such as this, is a good reason for saying this is testimonial."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2231.847,2255.899,"--Your Honor, I think that's why it's -- it's important that this is a public records case, because that is one of the assumptions that courts have made for hundreds of years with regard to the fact that there is -- there is a duty by the person who's taking down the information to -- to observe in a regular manner, to record in a regular manner, and so that's important here."
2010.09-10876,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2255.899,2262.485,"That was the principal thrust of your brief, that this isn't testimonial at all."

2010.09-10876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2315.953,2322.857,--Does the analyst know whether he's being asked to do one for the prosecution or the defendant?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2322.857,2325.457,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2344.686,2345.953,"Oh, so they would know the difference, right?"
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2345.953,2354.959,"They -- I think that the same information would be on the form whether the defendant submitted it or whether the -- or whether the prosecution submitted it, and--"
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.959,2356.928,"Well, not the same information."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2360.713,2361.982,--Your Honor--
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.982,2368.886,"So if the police submitted it, the -- the person doing the -- the test would know that the police submitted it, I assume."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2368.886,2378.658,"--If you look at the form, Your Honor, it would have the same information, but we're not -- we're not here today arguing that the analyst wouldn't know that the police submitted this form."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.931,2418.117,Why is a key question whether this was an interrogation?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2438.696,2441.529,"Your Honor, the analysis would be somewhat different."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.048,2446.85,It would be different because interrogation doesn't make any difference.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2453.087,2460.942,"--Your Honor, we -- it appears that it does make some difference with regard to Michigan v. Bryant, and it's new to all of us."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.942,2473.85,"If it were an interrogation, the factors mentioned in Michigan v. Bryant would be relevant, presumably, but since this wasn't an interrogation, I don't see how that has any -- any relevance whatever."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2473.85,2493.514,"Well, the relevance, Your Honor, I think, is since it's not an interrogation, then -- then you have to look at, and I think the Court has set this out, you have to look at the nature of the evidence and to make a determination as to whether the evidence that's being presented is merely a substitute for live, in-court testimony."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.206,2536.443,"Well, he'd look at the report and say, gee, I don't remember; you know, I do a lot of these reports."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2555.387,2581.639,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and so that's why the analysis of whether this is testimonial or not is such an important analysis, because if the -- the reasoning that the Court has had for all of the hearsay exceptions, for excited utterances or, in this case, for a public record, would look at whether or not that evidence was the best evidence to support the truth-finding purpose of the trial."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2601.885,2607.789,So why did you give the data to the analyst at trial?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2623.714,2631.654,"--Procedurally, in this case, Your Honor, this -- the trial at the District Court level occurred before the Court's opinion in Melendez-Diaz."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2642.324,2643.443,That's that as well.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2660.22,2661.905,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2661.905,2664.023,"Is it -- you're looking for that testimony, correct?"

2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2773.742,2774.694,It was not.
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.744,2776.827,Is it often contested?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2779.279,2787.283,"--I'm not aware of it being contested often, Your Honor, I -- and this form I think is one of the things in New Mexico that really helps with that."
2010.09-10876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.073,2801.109,"Yes, but the reason I asked the question is because I don't think it is normally contested."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,2812.5,2820.587,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I think that the distinction is that in this case the -- the analyst is not essentially a party to the action."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.045,2843.602,"General, I know your State takes a different view of it or you wouldn't be here, but aren't there are a number of States that -- that do provide the testimony of the technician, who do require the technician to come in and -- and testify?"

2010.09-10876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3157.837,3158.337,--General--
2010.09-10876,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3158.337,3180.825,"General, we seem to be describing -- this case seemed rather particular, that is, there was no objection by New Mexico to having an analyst show up, Razatos; so -- so he had to travel however long he said."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3216.796,3231.493,"Your Honor, one of the problems in New Mexico would be since -- since the court believed that -- that that report was -- was admissible, if they did a second sample and -- and tried to submit that it would be cumulative evidence, and probably would be kept out by -- by the rule in New Mexico in that case."
2010.09-10876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3244.268,3253.389,"Well, let's say that this Court holds that the Confrontation Clause requires the presence of the actual analyst to testify about the sample."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3265.024,3277.725,"It's not the rule, Your Honor, although one of the things that we pointed out is that -- is that the State always keeps two samples, that the defendant has the right statutorily in New Mexico to -- to have a sample retested at a lab--"
2010.09-10876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3277.725,3289.673,But I'm saying that analytically that does not bear on the question whether or not the sample that's introduced by the State requires the -- the analyst to be present.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3292.017,3293.265,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3293.265,3296.467,That may -- that may show that the confrontation rule is a silly rule.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3304.464,3304.979,Yes.
2010.09-10876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3304.979,3306.539,--by the presence of another sample.
2010.09-10876,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3306.539,3312.287,I -- I don't follow that because we have a substitute now.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3340.509,3360.127,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, in -- in your hypothetical, if -- if the State knew far enough ahead of time that they -- they would not be able to submit the -- the -- that analyst's results, they could always -- because the blood sample continues to exist, they could always retest that and -- and have another witness who could do that."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3390.972,3395.16,"General, I -- I don't want to eat up your -- your little remaining time, I think you can answer yes or no."
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3401.06,3402.093,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.093,3402.982,Why?
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3402.982,3416.135,"I think that you have to do the analysis in each kind of statement that you're looking at, Your Honor, to determine whether or not the statement that's -- that's being made and that's being proposed for trial is a substitute for live in-court testimony."
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3468.876,3470.174,Certainly not.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3470.174,3471.878,And -- and--
2010.09-10876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3471.878,3489.793,"But you -- you -- you think the result would be a -- the same if we could develop a machine that you put the bullet in and -- and -- and -- that's been fired from this gun, and the murder bullet, and the machine goes, blah, blah, blah, and it spits out, you know, 99 percent, 99.9 percent match, that would be okay?"
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3489.793,3491.15,"--May I answer the question, Your Honor?"
2010.09-10876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3491.15,3491.462,Sure.
2010.09-10876,1,25595,gary_k_king,,3491.462,3500.365,"In -- in that case, if -- if the machine were able to do all of that, the machine essentially is giving you the best evidence, yes, I believe that that would be the case."
2010.09-10876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3500.365,3502.162,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-10876,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3505.114,3506.564,Thank you.
2010.09-10876,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3556.622,3558.248,"Not under oath, though, that's the only difference?"
2010.09-10876,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3558.248,3571.975,"Not under oath if a certification is actually different than an oath, that just makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said that it would be implausible that trial by affidavit would be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would be okay."
2010.09-10876,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3571.975,3577.926,Do the rules of criminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New Mexico say it should be prima facie evidence?
2010.09-10876,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3577.926,3579.489,They say much the same thing.
2010.09-10876,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3611.676,3613.785,"Well, it depends on when they do it, of course."
2010.09-10876,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3623.764,3625.047,And I think that -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-10876,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3657.518,3658.469,"--Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-10876,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3658.469,3659.285,"In other words, the State just brought the wrong witness."
2010.09-10876,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3659.597,3659.878,"Thank you, counsel."
