1982.81-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.478,We'll hear arguments next in Bank America Corporation against the United States.
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,63.063,65.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.422,271.707,Do you mean uninterpreted or uninterrupted?
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,271.707,276.593,"Both, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.885,1062.889,"Mr. Simon, was this debate argument that you are now presenting also presented at the Court of Appeals?"
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,1062.889,1063.639,"Yes, indeed."
1982.81-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.525,1074.196,You didn't lose faith in it because you lost there.
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,1076.129,1083.285,Since 1914 the Congress has repeatedly modified Section 8.
1982.81-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.102,1121.125,"In this exchange, Mr. Simon, did any member advance or advocate the position now asserted by the government in this colloquy that was going on in these exchanges?"
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,1121.125,1121.775,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1170.455,1177.942,"In other words, Mr. Mann wanted to alter it to provide what the government now contends for?"
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,1177.942,1178.825,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.135,1406.406,"Mr. Simon, what liability does an interlocking director subject himself to by remaining on a board if the government is correct in its--"
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,1406.406,1408.025,"None whatever, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1437.028,1443.328,"--Well, doesn't that detract from your argument of 60 years of no prosecution or no construction by the government?"
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,1453.97,1464.509,"Oh, Justice Rehnquist, there are a number of cases where both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have sued to force somebody off a board."
1982.81-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.006,1472.515,"What is it, a declaratory judgment, is it, or--"
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,1472.515,1475.467,"No, sir, it's just a suit for an injunction to enjoin--"
1982.81-1487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1475.467,1476.084,--Injunction--
1982.81-1487,0,46195,william_simon,,1476.084,1477.669,--the man from serving on both boards.
1982.81-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.993,1724.678,"Very well, Mr. Simon."
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1726.644,1730.914,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1487,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1855.745,1861.633,"I take it, Mr. Kneedler, there is no disagreement with anything you have said so far?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1861.633,1863.085,"That's... that's correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1982.81-1487,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1863.085,1864.718,All right.
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1864.718,1883.787,"In this case, the petitioners, as Counsel has indicated, stipulated that the banks and insurance companies involved in this case are corporations engaged in commerce and that they are competitors, principally, in the extension of real estate and mortgage loans."
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.383,2000.037,"Well, how much weight does that really bear in a closed case, Mr. Kneedler?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2011.618,2018.381,"Well, I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that this Court has treated it as a starting point of analysis, and that's the... that's the point that I am making here."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.893,2045.711,"Well, it seems to me Justice Rehnquist's point is especially significant when, what is it, 60 years has gone by with one position on the part of the government in this area and now the government changes its position."
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2045.711,2048.944,"Well, I would like to address that point, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.78,2071.603,"Well, I wasn't referring to affirmative statements, I was talking about passivity, nonaction."
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2071.603,2090.131,"--Well, as this Court noted in the W.T. Grant case, which is the previous case it's had before it under Section 8, the government in the... in the decades immediately following the Clayton Act did not pursue enforcement, unfortunately, perhaps, in any area of Section 8."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.264,2116.498,"In the situation you are talking about, you are dealing with a new and what was then regarded as a revolutionary concept of law."
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2124.937,2127.889,"--No, that's... that... that's correct."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.889,2130.758,We've all had 60 years to think about it.
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2130.758,2135.02,"--Well, as I say--"
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2135.02,2136.958,60 years in this context.
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2136.958,2144.129,"--Well, the... as I say, the... there was not enforcement action under... under most circumstances under the Clayton Act."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2170.447,2180.485,"Is there a standing committee of either house or of both houses on focusing directly on antitrust matters, or a subcommittee of--"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2180.485,2183.671,The respective Judiciary Committees would--
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2183.671,2186.289,"--It would be a subcommittee of the Judiciary, would it not?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2186.289,2187.139,--Right.
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2189.325,2201.466,At least I recall 20 or 30 years ago Senator O'Mahoney was chairman of that subcommittee and was very active in surveillance of problems of this kind.
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2202.585,2205.833,--I don't know specifically on this.
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2206.8,2209.082,I mean generally oversight of the--
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2209.082,2210.985,"--Yes, I... yes, I think the Antitrust--"
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2210.985,2211.391,--antitrust laws.
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2211.391,2211.524,--Committees do.
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2242.043,2246.595,"Mr. Kneedler, do you know when the Antitrust Division of the department was created?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2246.595,2249.732,"I am sorry, I do not, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2369.441,2393.89,"Well, what, just by hypothesis, if a treble damage plaintiff alleged that the defendant took an action and that there were 10 out of the 30 directors were interlocking directors that were barred by the thing and if they hadn't voted in favor of the resolution, it wouldn't be carried, and this resolution was what led to the policy that is injured."
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2399.711,2411.656,"--Well, conceivably, although... although we were... it's our view that in almost every such situation there would be... it... there would be... or it would be necessary to prove an independent violation."
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2415.126,2419.108,You say that by itself couldn't constitute the antitrust violation?
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2419.108,2427.86,"--I don't want to rule it out entirely, but it seems to me that it would not, because the interlock itself does... is not an active sort of thing that injures someone else."
1982.81-1487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.086,2454.501,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, apart from the antitrust laws, is there any risk that if it were decided that all these directors had been acting unlawfully in serving as directors, that some of their corporate acts might be subject to challenge?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2454.501,2456.094,I would think not.
1982.81-1487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.608,2461.714,"And that would be a question of state law, I suppose."
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2461.714,2462.7,--I... I should think so.
1982.81-1487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.2,2466.235,You... you're sure they're perfectly safe?
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2466.235,2470.02,--I--
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.658,2505.126,Does it provide for all deliberate speed?
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2507.193,2525.763,"--Something along those lines, as the... as the Court... as the Court's decision last term in Romero Barcello, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act case, that indicated that the... an appropriate solution could be an injunction ordering the... the parties to come into compliance."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2581.592,2606.891,"Well, your position, or to put it this way, does your position assume that, going back to, let's say, 50 years ago when Senator Robinson of, I think, Arkansas and Wright Patman of Texas, and O'Mahoney and Norris of Nebraska were all very active in this surveillance of antitrust laws."
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2612.141,2613.277,I--
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2613.277,2617.312,Did these interlocking directorates escaped their notice all that time?
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2617.312,2627.001,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think... well, even if the... even if these interlocking directorates came to their attention, again I would make the point that just because they exist does not mean that they violate the statute."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.655,2638.392,"Yes, but they must have been all pretty well aware of Congressman Mann's position."
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2638.392,2647.046,"Well, we... we don't have any... we don't have any indication of congressional reaction in the... in the ensuing years."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2702.631,2726.664,"Well, is it possible that, to take the more recent one, Senator O'Mahoney's subcommittee on antimonopolies and some other... and the broad range, that those men who were acutely familiar with these fields were not conscious that there were thousands of interlocking directorates of banks and other companies?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2726.664,2735.084,"--Well, I... there... there have been these staff reports that have called it to the attention of Congress."
1982.81-1487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2804.997,2820.757,"Before you get to that, do you think... do you think there is any merit to Mr. Simon's argument that this really isn't an exemption, it's a question of how you define the offense, because if you said all corporations except banks in the first clause, that wouldn't be an exemption, would it?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2820.757,2827.88,"--Well, I... I... I regard that as essentially a semantic difference."
1982.81-1487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.026,2858.649,"But it's quite different from a separate statutory enactment, like an exemption from the... for labor or an exemption for the insurance industry, the McCarran Act or something of that kind, isn't it?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2858.649,2887.251,"--Well, it's... it's... it's different in the sense that they were enacted at different times, but I think that it's... the analysis is the same in the sense that the... that the exemption for which the petitioners are arguing cuts against the grain of the... of the principal prohibition, which based on the legislative history and the broad political support that gave rise to it was... was... reflected a congressional intent broadly to attack these interlocking directorates."
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3396.224,3400.642,"Well, why would you say that particularly in the light of the language and the structure of the act?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3407.857,3417.871,"--No, I... I would concede that that reasonable persons can differ as the... as the two... as the two courts below have indicated, the Federal Trade Commission--"
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3417.871,3421.657,"Well, then why wouldn't you put some reliance on this sort of a discussion?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3421.657,3426.561,"--Well, I am not--"
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3426.561,3427.544,What it says--
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3427.544,3437.785,"--I am not saying... I am not saying that it should be ignored, but what... what should be... I think what the Court's task in a case such as this is through... to reconcile the competing... the competing policies and to... and to--"
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.785,3440.971,"--Well, Congress has reconciled those, I take it?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3440.971,3442.406,--That's... well--
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3442.406,3450.009,You want to rely on a bunch of general presumptions and not address what congressmen thought about this particular clause.
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3450.009,3461.298,"--Well, the... but the presumptions that I am speaking of are not judge-made rules, they are guides to the interpretation of the body of antitrust... of antitrust statutes that--"
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3461.298,3465.602,Is there... is there a provision in the antitrust acts that says they shall be liberally construed?
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3465.602,3471.006,"--No, but that... that is thought to reflect the intent of the Congress that enacts those statutes by--"
1982.81-1487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.006,3475.058,"Well, where... I... you say the presumption of liberal construction is not a judge-made rule?"
1982.81-1487,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3475.058,3476.743,"--Well, I... I mispoke."
1982.81-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3534.163,3534.796,Very well.
1982.81-1487,2,46195,william_simon,,3538.074,3540.679,"I have just one comment, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1487,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3555.879,3557.33,Thank you gentlemen.
