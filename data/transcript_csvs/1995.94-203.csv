1995.94-203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.798,"We will now hear argument in Number 94 203, Morse v. The Republican Party of Virginia."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,10.629,11.918,Thank you.
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.878,109.852,"Ms. Karlan, may I inquire, your brief suggests possibly three different theories of why section 5 might have been violated, and the first is that the 45 fee affects the process of selecting the nominee, and the second is that being a delegate to the convention is an elective party office, and third is the threat that the change from a primary election to a nominating convention required preclearance."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,123.863,126.865,"Well, Your Honor, they were properly presented below."
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.693,159.148,"The change from a primary to a convention, was that... it was not part of your complaint?"
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,159.148,161.429,"--No, Your Honor, it was not part of our complaint."
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.429,162.458,You talked about it.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,162.458,163.289,That's correct.
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.301,186.163,"Well, the court below did not deal with those... with the second and third so called theories?"
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,186.163,187.195,"No, Your Honor, it did."
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.77,204.436,But do you think it dealt with the issue of whether the change itself from a primary to a convention required preclearance?
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,204.436,210.849,"--It said, Your Honor, that nothing connected with the convention, including implicitly the decision to hold one, is covered--"
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.849,212.091,And certainly not expressly.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,214.062,225.479,"--No, Your Honor, but under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, we were entitled to conform the pleadings to the proof, and had this case not been done in the expedited manner in which it was done, we could have amended the complaint."
1995.94-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,275.783,281.026,"Ms. Karlan, may I ask you a preliminary question... at least, I think it's preliminary to that."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,301.962,321.873,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, a political party under the circumstances of this case is a State actor in the same way that the Fifteenth Amendment by its terms simply guarantees the right to vote against abridgement or denial by a State, and has been held to cover political parties when they're engaged in the public nominating function."
1995.94-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.873,336.173,"I can see that... you... you're referring to constitutional... decisions under the Constitution like Terry and Smith v. Allwright, but here we have a statute, and the statute addresses State or political subdivisions."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,340.067,343.921,"There is no definition of State in the statute itself, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.719,389.531,"Ms. Karlan, how can that be?"
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,416.649,425.545,"Your Honor, section 5 of the Voting Rights Act would not cover the decision to form a party as discriminatory on the basis of race, but the Nineteenth Amendment--"
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.545,426.887,Their selection of a candidate.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,426.887,437.513,"--The Nineteenth Amendment, Your Honor, would say that if that party performs the public electoral function of nominating a candidate for United States Senator, they would be covered by the Constitution."
1995.94-203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.513,446.769,"May I ask if the Virginia statutes draw a distinction between new parties such as Justice Scalia's feminist party, and established parties like the Republican Party and the Democratic Party?"
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,446.769,448.011,"Yes, Justice Stevens, but--"
1995.94-203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.011,449.743,What is the difference under Virginia law?
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,449.743,468.824,"--Under Virginia law, a political party within the meaning of the Virginia statute only comes into being if at one of the last two Statewide general elections some candidate of that party received 10 percent of the votes cast for Statewide office, so that the party to which Justice Scalia refers would not itself be covered."
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.334,470.456,Unless it was successful.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,470.456,471.656,"--Ultimately, yes."
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.656,474.738,"And won election, and thereupon it would have to be, I suppose, disbanded."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,474.738,482.525,"Under the Nineteenth Amendment, which is not at issue in this case, yes, Your Honor, which says that no State shall abridge or deny the right to vote on account of sex."
1995.94-203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.525,500.217,"Well, but the question is whether or not this is a State or a political subdivision, and it seems to me in light of the two cases Justice Ginsburg mentioned, Terry v. Adams and Smith v. Allwright, that you have a difficult position to maintain."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,512.993,513.874,"Well, but--"
1995.94-203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,513.874,516.087,--and that's what you want... and you want us to say the latter.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,516.087,535.959,"--Well, but Justice Kennedy, the provision under which the exclusions in Terry and in Smith v. Allwright were found discriminatory was a provision that only applied to the States, so Congress could reasonably assume that if it was State action for a political party to bar someone from a preprimary in which there was no governmental involvement whatsoever--"
1995.94-203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.959,540.393,I am assuming that State action cases are correct.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,545.727,548.278,"--No, Your Honor, this language is not limited."
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.372,563.989,The court held political parties were covered in those cases when election as the nominee of that political party was effectively election to the office.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,563.989,565.169,"--No, Your Honor--"
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.169,567.82,That's quite a different situation from what one has here.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,567.82,568.09,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,580.738,585.641,"No question about that, but those cases did not purport to be interpreting this language."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,591.728,602.965,"Well, Your Honor, if I may draw a historical point not in the record, in 1965, the States that were covered by the Voting Rights Act were all States in the solid South, which was solidly Democratic."
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,627.472,635.446,"Well, Ms. Karlan, the Attorney General has adopted a number of regulations pursuant to section 5 and the provisions of the Voting Rights Act."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,640.73,647.675,"I believe that they are all valid, yes, Your Honor, and they do provide that when political parties perform the State--"
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,647.675,651.318,And you rely on those regulations to make your case?
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,651.318,661.713,"--They certainly support our case, but even if those regulations were invalid, our case would go forward, because our claim is that this is a primary election in the same way that the behavior in Terry is a primary--"
1995.94-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,661.713,668.028,"Do you think that absent those regulations, your position would be sustained here?"
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,668.028,669.39,"--I would hope so, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.459,691.673,"Ms. Karlan, you say that this would not have been... it would have been a dead letter if it couldn't have been applied against the Democratic Party in the South in the era when it was enacted."
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,695.987,703.541,"Your Honor, I only have the list of the number of times where objections were lodged, and that was about a dozen."
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.155,709.766,How recent is that dozen?
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,709.766,711.538,"That was in 1982, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.538,714.2,"1982, a good deal after the South was--"
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,714.2,715.609,"No, that was--"
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.609,716.841,--in the situation that you described.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,716.841,723.316,"--No, Your Honor, that's a list of all of the objections imposed as of the date 1982, not objections in the year 1982."
1995.94-203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.316,723.817,Just 12.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,723.817,724.916,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,724.916,727.237,"Ms. Karlan, may I go back to the textual argument?"
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,739.825,740.736,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,740.736,740.856,--basically what you're saying?
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,779.121,785.015,"The reason it's in there, Justice Souter, is because section 5 of the Voting Rights Act only applies to particular places."
1995.94-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,794.903,795.624,Ah.
1995.94-203,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,795.624,796.225,--are covered by the statute at all.
1995.94-203,1,37685,paul_bender,,882.951,893.74,"Thank you, Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.627,976.322,"Well, Mr. Bender, I can understand an argument to the effect that if the State permits a party to change from a primary election to a convention method, that that action by the State in allowing that change is something that in and of itself could be challenged under section 5, but I'm not sure that's what was done here."
1995.94-203,1,37685,paul_bender,,985.549,996.546,"I think the question is whether, under State law, a party or any other group has a right to put a candidate on the ballot in a preferred position if they maintain a certain organization."
1995.94-203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1007.485,1009.095,"Well, back up a minute."
1995.94-203,1,37685,paul_bender,,1021.263,1023.904,"--Yes, if the State... if State law did that--"
1995.94-203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1023.904,1026.476,Do you think that question is before us in this case?
1995.94-203,1,37685,paul_bender,,1026.476,1028.809,--I don't think that question is before you in this case.
1995.94-203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.055,1084.168,"Mr. Bender, what do you mean by a preferred position?"
1995.94-203,1,37685,paul_bender,,1092.832,1094.573,I think that case would come out the same way--
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1506.388,1510.652,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1550.817,1557.792,"Mr. Getchell, do you concede the validity of the Attorney General's regulations here?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1557.792,1564.939,"Not if they are construed as the Attorney General would have them be construed, because I think that would raise grave First Amendment issues."
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1564.939,1572.171,"Well, the regulations seem to extend the application to political parties in some circumstances."
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1578.025,1588.624,"There are certain actions performed by the political parties which are clearly delegated public electoral functions, involving exclusively--"
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1588.624,1589.586,"Well, could you answer my question?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1593.018,1593.599,--It can be.
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.599,1594.42,Under the statute?
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1594.42,1594.889,It can be.
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1622.189,1641.37,"Well, that's a curious line to draw, because where the State is conducting primary election activities by way of administering them, I assume that any change can be challenged by a suit against the State itself, so the line you would draw is a little curious, I would think."
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1641.37,1648.656,--I think the line that I have drawn is the one that the Attorney General sought to draw in the regulation.
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1656.421,1656.741,No.
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1662.765,1665.396,--It does not reach political parties on its face.
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1676.065,1678.115,What jurisprudence are you talking about?
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1678.115,1685.178,"--I am talking about Williams v. The Democratic Party, which this Court summarily affirmed in 1972."
1995.94-203,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1735.291,1744.788,"Well, Mr. Getchell, is it fair to say that it is only exercising that function, on your view, if it is in fact using traditional State machinery?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1744.788,1745.489,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1745.489,1759.477,"So that in... it is fair to say, I take it, then, on your view that although there are some circumstances in which the party would be covered, there are no circumstances in which the party would be covered which could not also be subject to a challenge directly to the State itself."
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1759.477,1760.668,"I believe that to be the case, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1760.668,1760.839,Okay.
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1766.872,1773.758,"Well, if it were viewed as a direct qualification for voting in the primary, it presumably would be."
1995.94-203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1786.386,1802.766,"--But if the convention, as I understand it, is effectively a substitute for the primary, they both serve the same function in selecting candidates who will appear in preferred positions on the ballot, the function is identical, is it not?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1804.939,1818.207,"I would commend to Your Honor the law review article by a Professor Weisburd that we have cited several times in our briefs, where he makes the political science point that they're quite different animals."
1995.94-203,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1843.645,1850.607,"In your view, then, would this 45 fee stand on the same level as, say, the requirement of passing a literacy test?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1850.607,1851.688,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1897.51,1901.771,So you're saying the difference in that and a literacy test is that yours is a more reasonable requirement?
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1901.771,1902.742,I don't see--
1995.94-203,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1902.742,1905.004,But we're asking about whether or not this--
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1905.004,1905.424,--I--
1995.94-203,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1905.424,1910.577,--the hypothetical literacy test is subject to challenge under either the act or the Constitution.
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1910.577,1911.498,--I may have misunderstood the hypothetical.
1995.94-203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1925.768,1926.739,So in your--
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1926.739,1927.36,It would be suicidal.
1995.94-203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.36,1935.204,"--In your view... this is what I... I mean, the... it's a difficult question, I realize, but I put the obvious question to you."
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1950.975,1952.174,We agree that's covered.
1995.94-203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.174,1952.535,All right.
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1981.455,1986.158,They... I think they very definitely wanted to avoid any collision with First Amendment Rights.
1995.94-203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1986.158,2002.36,"So you're saying they didn't want to cover the possibility that the Democratic Party in the South, or the Republican Party, would say, oh, we no longer can insist only whites vote at the primary, so what we'll do is, we'll do exactly the same thing but call it a convention."
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2002.36,2003.048,I am saying--
1995.94-203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.048,2008.424,"You're saying they didn't want to cover that obvious situation, despite Terry v.... you know, the cases that seem quite similar."
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2008.424,2015.296,"--I am saying simply, Justice Breyer, that they didn't cover it."
1995.94-203,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.497,2018.589,Maybe they wanted to but didn't think they had the power to.
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2018.589,2022.692,"--Well, I believe they would have very grave constitutional problems."
1995.94-203,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.692,2033.709,"Right, and the evidence that they didn't want to cover it, even though there was a Supreme Court case right on point which said that it was covered under the Constitution, the evidence that they didn't want to cover it is what?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2033.709,2038.174,I would submit that it is first in the plain language of the statute.
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2093.949,2107.319,"Well, Mr. Getchell, what about the change that Justice Breyer asked about from the conduct of a primary election to holding a party convention instead?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2112.903,2122.508,"That challenge, 1) may I say with respect to that question that we submit that no such change was made, that this--"
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2122.508,2137.616,"If there were a change, a party says, okay, the statute will reach us if we exclude people under the primary so we want to change to a convention system, would that change be subject to challenge--"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2137.616,2138.988,--I believe--
1995.94-203,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2138.988,2139.489,--in your view?
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2139.489,2151.767,"--I believe that the statute that permits, in the State's view, a party to call upon it to conduct a primary, when that statute is changed, that is subject to preclearance."
1995.94-203,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.625,2196.256,May I ask--
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2196.256,2196.987,What we do is not.
1995.94-203,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2196.987,2198.019,--May I ask you a question?
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2202.18,2205.402,"I think it's good law, but I think--"
1995.94-203,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.402,2209.956,"Well, how do you do... and the word involved there was State, in the Fifteenth Amendment."
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2218.252,2224.746,--I would say that Terry v. Adams and Smith v. Allwright are extremely fact specific.
1995.94-203,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2245.88,2247.711,But what about the preprimary?
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2250.493,2254.045,--That is subject to the same analysis.
1995.94-203,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.888,2263.692,"I know you cite the professor's article, but which opinion that was written in that case supports your analysis?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2263.692,2285.926,"The opinions, of course, in both Smith v. Allwright and in Terry v. Adams I believe were plurality opinions, and basically the State action for most or all of the justices noted the fact that it was a one party State, that the nomination was tantamount to election."
1995.94-203,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.991,2295.783,"Well, would your position be different in this case if Virginia was a one party State?"
1995.94-203,2,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2295.783,2302.886,"--If Virginia were a one party State, it would be subject to suit under the same theory under the Constitution."
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3274.922,3276.995,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
1995.94-203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3351.593,3354.754,"If they paid for it themselves, yes, if it wasn't a State run primary."
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3354.754,3362.989,"That might be correct, but Your Honor, the freedom of association point might be the same even if they did, and this court clearly has never taken that broad an approach."
1995.94-203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3363.78,3367.653,I think the freedom to associate is not the freedom to have the Government pay for your association.
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3370.926,3371.885,--That's correct.
1995.94-203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3423.91,3427.981,I assume that a State cannot limit the ballot to labor union members.
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3427.981,3429.614,That's correct.
1995.94-203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.614,3432.335,Can a political party limit the ballot to labor union members?
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3434.826,3436.927,That runs a primary election--
1995.94-203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.927,3438.72,"No, no primary, just as a convention."
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3438.72,3440.16,--And that receives--
1995.94-203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3440.16,3442.092,"They say, you can't get into the convention unless you are a union member."
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3442.092,3444.684,--And receives a place on the ballot above all other parties?
1995.94-203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3444.684,3449.276,"It's successful on the first election, and therefore is automatically listed on the ballot in later elections."
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3449.276,3450.928,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3454.661,3455.531,Why don't you know?
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3462.486,3468.179,"--I would have to know what the State involvement in that political party's placement on the ballot is, and I don't know what that is, Your Honor."
1995.94-203,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3468.179,3471.1,What is it here... you keep saying preferred position--
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3471.1,3471.721,Yes.
1995.94-203,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3471.721,3473.082,--of the Republicans or the Democrats.
1995.94-203,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3474.684,3499.108,"Under section 24.2 613 of the Virginia Code, political parties receive placement on the ballot above... lexically above all other candidates, and as Mr. Bender referred, there's a function called roll off, which means as you move down the ballot, fewer and fewer people are still voting, and it turns out that being the number 1 candidate or number 2 candidate on a ballot gives you some substantial bump up in the number of votes you receive."
