1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.198,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-97, Northwest Airlines, Inc., versus the County of Kent."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,50.115,53.097,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.612,139.382,That would be the private right of action point?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,139.382,139.662,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.662,142.983,"And that is one of the questions presented in the petition, is it not?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,142.983,144.085,"It is not, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.038,152.471,Very well.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,152.471,157.864,"Nevertheless, we realize the Court may elect to reach it, so we have briefed the matter in our reply brief."
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.88,248.924,"Mr. Smith, how many other Federal statutes are there that confer ratemaking responsibilities upon Federal courts?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,256.199,257.469,"I think not, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.469,261.122,"You're saying what you're entitled to are reasonable rates, which are going to be determined by Federal courts."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,264.744,274.521,I think the court is often in the business of determining whether or not impositions made by a State in the form of user fees are reasonable.
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.071,292.671,You don't allow any profit in your assertion of reasonableness.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,303.56,304.75,I think that's right.
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.041,309.053,"In normal ratemaking, you're allowed a fair return on your capital."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,309.584,327.176,"--Not under the AHTA, Your Honor, because under the AHTA Congress recognized that the vast bulk of the revenues that fund airports are going to come from the Federal Government through taxes paid by passengers, and Congress wanted no further additional fees to be imposed on users of airports except those that would be absolutely--"
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.176,327.566,But the reason--
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,327.566,330.777,--necessary to keep... and to keep the airport self-sustaining.
1993.92-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,332.479,333.26,"--So you'd allow depreciation, would you?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,333.26,334.74,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1993.92-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,334.74,336.58,Is depreciation absolutely necessary?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,336.58,345.906,"They can recover their costs, Your Honor, and to the extent they had costs that they had to expend to purchase assets to serve users."
1993.92-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,347.688,350.861,And can they retain some of those costs for future construction?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,350.861,360.646,"--I think they can, Your Honor, so long as they are costs absolutely necessary for additional assets or for replacement of assets."
1993.92-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,360.646,382.501,"Well, the airport is saying here, you know, we're facing construction fees on reasonable projections of... you know, multiple millions of dollars, so there's nothing for example, terribly impressive about this surplus of $9 million, if they could anticipate future expense to that extent in, as you put it, recovering their costs."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,389.156,395.709,"Because, Your Honor, here they accumulated surpluses far beyond airport needs."
1993.92-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,397.671,402.323,"Well, airport needs judged at what point, at what time?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,402.323,420.756,"--Defined even by the airport itself, Your Honor, after they had met all of their costs, all of their debt service, and had purchased every conceivable future capital expenditure that they could think of in their wish list all the way through the end of the decade, this airport still has substantial surpluses left over."
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.44,431.752,"Weren't those surpluses generated by payments from the concessioners, not from the airline?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,431.752,432.783,"Part of them were, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.783,435.986,"I thought it all was, basically."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,435.986,436.407,"No, Your Honor--"
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,436.407,440.508,"I mean, the reason they have a surplus is the payments from the concessioners."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,440.508,465.736,"--No, Your Honor, that isn't so, because if they had fairly allocated costs at this airport it would then have become apparent that the surpluses are coming from the airlines, and if they hadn't attempted to recover their assets two and three times over through this mythical mortgage of pretending there was an 8-1/2 percent mortgage attached to assets they had acquired, they were recovering surpluses from the airlines through the mythical mortgage--"
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.736,467.456,Isn't it true that under--
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,467.456,468.047,--something on the order of $1 million a year.
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.047,477.804,"--under the Federal law, whatever surplus is there can only be used for airport purposes, it can't be diverted to general State coffers?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,477.804,487.568,"That is correct, Your Honor, but as the Solicitor General points out in his brief, revenues may not be accumulated indefinitely or in unlimited amounts, and what has happened here is--"
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,487.568,489.992,"If that's true, that's a violation of a different statute."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,495.446,497.035,"--No... well, we did below, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.035,499.267,It's a violation of that statute that you're describing.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,499.267,501.45,"We believe, Your Honor, that when--"
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.45,502.168,Or perhaps a violation.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,502.168,517.288,"--when Congress imposed the requirement of reasonable fees, it did so in the light of the requirements of the grant assurance provisions, which all parties here have agreed ought to be taken into account in determining the meaning of reasonableness in the AHTA."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.288,523.412,Is it essential to your case that there be a finding that there has been an unreasonable surplus that violates section 2210?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,523.412,524.102,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.468,544.607,"And I wonder if there was any duty to... the duty in that section is to spend the money on airport improvements, and they... you're not alleging they've spent the money on anything else, and then the Government says, you also can't accumulate too large a surplus, but I don't know that you've alleged they've accumulated too large a surplus, have you?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,544.607,549.8,"We have alleged, Your Honor, that they have to have some evident purpose for the surplus."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,551.552,553.261,In order to avoid the violation of that statute.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,553.261,569.164,"--In our view, Your Honor, the reasonableness of requirement of AHTA must be read in light of the AAIA, and its requirements that the airport only earn enough to be self-sustaining but not so much as to create financial windfalls."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.214,578.32,"If there were no section 2210, they could go into the business of selling parking spaces and so forth and make all the money in the world and not use it on the airport."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,585.133,586.815,"--I think that's not right, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,594.879,598.242,"Now, Evansville was a dormant Commerce Clause case?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,598.242,598.552,--Right.
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,599.862,606.407,And you think that the dormant Commerce Clause analysis means that you achieve this result?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,608.86,610.791,"--I think, Your Honor, the requirement--"
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,610.791,614.695,That strikes me as a very tough argument to make.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,614.695,616.044,"--Well, let me try to persuade you otherwise."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.962,650.889,"But Evansville was dormant Commerce Clause, and certainly your principal case here isn't under the dormant Commerce Clause, is it?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,650.889,665.606,"No, the principal case, Your Honor, is under the AHTA, which was adopted by Congress in light of the Evansville decision expressly, and the AHTA was intended by Congress to go even further than this Court had gone in its dormant Commerce Clause."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,665.606,666.818,What's your authority for that proposition?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,666.818,670.821,"Oh, the legislative history, Your Honor, of the AHTA, which is cited in our brief, makes clear--"
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.821,675.042,"But... you know, we have a section of the statute here."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,676.945,701.83,"--Well, Your Honor, the meaning of the word that's here at issue is the word AHTA, and we believe that the Court should interpret the meaning of the word AHTA was adopted, and that purpose was to strengthen the requirements of Evansville, and if Evansville would not have permitted the surpluses that have been developed by this airport and we--"
1993.92-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.83,703.793,Where does Evansville say you can't have surpluses?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,703.793,713.357,"--Well, Your Honor, I started to read from Evansville... we say that what this airport has done violates Evansville because that case says at 404 U.S. at 720,"
1993.92-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,729.529,736.234,"But you're using a case that was... in which the airport succeeded in retaining its charges, right?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,738.536,740.366,--No.
1993.92-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.862,752.193,That's what I mean.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,752.193,753.064,--Yes... sorry.
1993.92-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.064,759.068,"The airport won the case, and you're using that case to say, but in this case the airport loses."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,759.068,770.818,"Yes, because the Congress said in letting the airport win, the Court didn't apply as strict prohibitions as it should have, and the Congress went further in the AHTA."
1993.92-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,770.818,772.999,"And said, no head tax."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,772.999,775.459,"It said a lot more than no head tax, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,786.927,797.525,"Mr. Smith, now, you could... your client could have gone the administrative route, I guess, here--"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,797.525,798.375,Presumably so.
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.375,801.096,--to make its complaints about these charges.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,801.096,809.272,"Yes, Your Honor, that contention is made here, but we believe Congress didn't require us to do that, and certainly didn't make it administratively exclusive."
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,809.272,812.213,"And in any event, no effort was made here to go administratively."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,812.213,813.114,"None was made, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.335,834.448,"He already decided one case, at least, involving the reasonableness of fees, didn't he?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,834.448,835.999,--The Secretary?
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.999,836.46,Yes.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,836.46,837.501,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,857.212,867.721,"In your view, does the Secretary have the authority to make any more refined or precise allocations than does a court when you bring an action before the court rather than the agency?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,867.721,875.385,"He may, Your Honor, but the very policies that the Solicitor General describes that are the views of the Secretary are very much our own."
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,877.606,882.49,"From your standpoint, a court can do whatever the agency can do, and vice versa, in this area of allocating?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,882.49,884.702,"--Perhaps not, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,893.348,906.496,"The point of my question is, is to the extent the Court thinks that what you're asking for is simply too cumbersome and precise for courts to be involved in, if there's an equivalency, then it follows that the agency can't be involved in it, either."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,906.496,917.753,"--Well, Your Honor, as I say, we are not in this case, contrary to what the airport says, asking this Court to become involved in the intricacies of ratemaking."
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,925.928,933.272,"When, when we decide the adequacy of a surplus and allocations between fuel taxes and other sorts of charges, it seems to me that's very close to ratemaking."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,933.272,940.377,"--Your Honor, with regard to allocation, we would merely ask the Court to require the airport to come up with some kind of allocation."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,940.377,943.078,"Well, all we can do is decide this case, Mr. Smith."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,966.264,973.87,"We think the uniform system that's described in the Secretary's policies, as stated in the S.G.'s brief, are the same ones we are espousing."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.87,985.617,"You can have the same standards, but if you turn them over to 93 different district courts to apply, you're probably going to get a lot more differences than if you have one administrative agency applying them."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,985.617,986.719,"I would suggest not, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.205,1014.537,You say all we're talking about is applying the Evansville standards.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1023.413,1045.477,"That is true, Your Honor, and when the judicial action is brought, of course, the courts are required, as both the Sixth and Seventh Circuit recognized, to determine what Congress intended when it used the word ""reasonable"" in this statute, and both of them, in fact all of the many courts that looked at the issue, have agreed that what Congress was doing was in fact strengthening the prohibitions of the Evansville decision."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1046.218,1051.239,That may be one reason why we should decide there isn't any private right of action.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1051.239,1058.556,"--Well, of course, Your Honor, we don't think you should decide there isn't a private right of action unless that's what Congress contemplated."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1058.556,1059.607,"Well, naturally."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1062.029,1062.668,Yes.
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.668,1072.215,"Before you get to that, even your statement that it's clear from the legislative history that Congress was strengthening the Evansville standards, I mean, that leaves a lot of running room."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1092.068,1098.091,"Well, except for the fact that this Court itself was in substance, in Evansville itself, deciding what were reasonable fees."
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1098.091,1103.246,"Well, that may have been an erroneous approach under the dormant Commerce Clause."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1111.982,1125.8,"Your Honor, I would suggest to you that in all of your Commerce Clause decisions where fees or taxes or impositions by a State are being imposed on Commerce, you are in effect deciding... you do this in the Complete Auto--"
1993.92-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1125.8,1133.914,"Well, isn't the Court looking more at whether there's a discrimination or an excessive burden on interstate commerce?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1135.756,1149.846,"--That is true, Your Honor, and we believe, in fact, we have an excessive burden on interstate commerce in this case for the reason that I've said, because we have an airport not fairly allocating its costs and producing revenues far in excess of costs."
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1149.846,1164.996,"Do you know any case where we validate a discriminatory tax, discriminatory as to out-of-State participants, on the ground that the revenue is recovered by some other tax that's imposed on local entities?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1166.677,1170.268,Are you talking about the justification that's been offered for the--
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1170.268,1170.509,Yes.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1172.339,1173.43,--I don't think--
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1173.43,1177.923,Do we compare two or three different taxes to see the total burden on all of the participants?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1177.923,1179.345,--I don't think this Court has ever--
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1179.345,1180.266,Correct me if I'm wrong.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1180.266,1186.03,"--Well, I don't think this Court has ever approved what happened here on the discrimination point, which was essentially robbing--"
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1186.03,1186.468,But has the Court--
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1186.468,1186.909,--Peter to pay Paul.
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1186.909,1198.656,--ever entertained an analysis of a whole State's tax system to determine the burdens imposed upon interstate and... in-State and out-of-State participants?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1201.25,1226.836,"I think that's right, Your Honor, but I would suggest to you that inasmuch as the AAIA prohibits all manner of unjust discrimination among users, it wouldn't matter whether it was an interstate... interstate or intrastate commerce situation, that here, by undertaxing general aviation, they've made up the money they say by overtaxing the concessions, and of course, as the Court knows, the concession fees here are paid for by the passengers."
1993.92-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1245.399,1259.658,"Well, it seems to me that your argument is valid under the standard, conventional Commerce Clause analysis if you show a discrimination between general aviation and the commercial aviation, but when you then have the concessions, and you start balancing revenues, it seems to me that's a very strange dormant Commerce Clause argument."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1259.658,1265.692,"Well, but we believe there is discrimination just by looking at how they treated general aviation as compared with the airlines, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.692,1266.882,"Mr. Smith, I'd like you to back up on one point."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1266.882,1267.432,Surely.
1993.92-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1267.432,1274.427,Why do you equate general aviation with intrastate commerce and commercial with inter?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1289.228,1308.268,"There was not explicit evidence on that issue, Your Honor, you're right about that, and the reason there was not was because the district judge dismissed our Commerce Clause claim at the beginning, and if we prevail here that we were entitled to have at least raised a Commerce Clause contention, we believe we would be entitled on remand to adduce the kind of evidence that you're talking about."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.268,1322.608,"Well, did you allege in your Commerce... the Commerce Clause section of your complaint that the general aviation was intrastate and the airport was... airlines was commercial?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1322.608,1323.82,"That was our position, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.82,1325.299,"I said, did you allege it?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1325.299,1327.182,"I believe that we did, Your Honor, but I'm not certain."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1327.182,1336.859,"Because certainly the... I don't see really why you're entitled to a remand just because the district court dismissed your complaint, unless you brought that out in your complaint."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1336.859,1356.273,"Well, I guess I would argue, Your Honor, as you know from our second presented question here, that if, in fact, we were entitled to raise our Commerce Clause claim, which was dismissed prior to trial, had he correctly allowed us to proceed on the Commerce Clause claim, we would then have attempted to adduce the kind of evidence that Justice Ginsburg is referring to."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.273,1359.693,What was the basis for the district court's dismissal of your Commerce Clause claim?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1359.693,1369.33,"I think it was that he thought because Congress had taken some action in this area that is, under the AHTA... we were precluded from bringing a Commerce Clause claim."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.33,1371.972,"It wasn't, then, as you understand it, a dismissal on the merits?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1371.972,1373.113,"Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1379.228,1387.683,"Did you concede, and do you now concede, that under the statute the distinction between burdens on intrastate and interstate commerce are irrelevant... is irrelevant?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1387.683,1389.232,"Are irrelevant, Your Honor?"
1993.92-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1389.232,1389.493,Yes.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1389.493,1399.791,"We do not believe that for purpose of the AHTA, that we have to show, as the airport contends, that there was interstate as against intrastate discrimination."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.698,1427.18,"Mr. Smith, may I ask you a question?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1448.331,1452.625,"Your Honor, if they fairly allocated the costs between the two--"
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.625,1452.825,No.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1471.118,1477.472,"--It would not, Your Honor, because they would still not be fairly allocating costs between the users."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1492.931,1496.594,"These costs you're talking about, are they costs in the terminal, or are you talking about runway maintenance, or what are you talking about?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1496.594,1504.398,"--When we talk about unfair allocation, we're talking only about the air side costs as they benefit the concessions, and that they create the customers for the concessions."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.398,1507.322,"By air side costs, you mean the nonoperational stuff?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1507.322,1511.413,"Exactly, Your Honor, all of those costs that produce the takeoff and landing facilities."
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.413,1520.159,"Well, if they totally eliminated that, they just closed all those concessions but continued to operate the same runways and charge you the same... well, they couldn't do that, because they'd have to have the terminal then, I guess."
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1520.159,1520.59,They would.
1993.92-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.59,1527.474,The thing that puzzles me is that I don't understand you to be challenging the reasonableness of the charges for what you actually use.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1527.474,1529.536,"But we do, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.117,1547.809,"Mr. Smith, are you going to say something about private right of access?"
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1547.809,1549.05,"Yes, I was going to, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1549.05,1549.341,I was very interested in that.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1560.457,1564.16,"It would, because we won in part below, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.16,1564.511,I--
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1564.511,1568.271,You could not... because the Sixth Circuit ruled in our favor on a portion of our--
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.271,1568.722,--On the CFR costs.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1568.722,1569.112,--Exactly.
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.112,1571.104,That's the only item to which it would expand it.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1579.901,1580.03,"Well, but--"
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.03,1580.63,Is that true or false?
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1580.63,1591.339,"--That's false, because the Sixth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, and that entire judgment is now before the Court, and the Court, if it now reaches the private right of action issue, cannot affirm this judgment."
1993.92-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.537,1603.09,That issue's fairly well joined.
1993.92-97,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1603.09,1604.499,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1606.419,1607.801,"Very well, Mr. Smith."
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1609.252,1637.34,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-97,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1672.163,1678.048,"If the airlines refuse to pay the fees, they would be sued in court, would they not?"
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1684.049,1685.231,They might very well.
1993.92-97,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1685.231,1691.075,"Okay, so there's no way to insulate these issues from court review."
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1691.075,1696.108,"Well, we think that proceeding would normally be brought in State court."
1993.92-97,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1703.464,1725.156,"Oh, I grant you that, but just in sort of making the calculus of what Congress might have assumed, Congress certainly did... presumably started with the assumption that there was at least some circumstances in which these issues would be litigated as between private parties and in the kind of action that we've got here, except that it would be brought by the airport on the airlines' refusal to pay."
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1725.156,1751.576,"We think the Congress assumed, or intended, that these issues would be dealt with primarily by the Secretary, and... for instance, we believe that a State court faced with this issue might very well say one of two things, either that it would defer to the Secretary's determination of reasonableness, to the extent that was the issue, or that it would simply refuse to hold the fees unreasonable unless the airlines could produce evidence from the Secretary that the Secretary believed them to be so."
1993.92-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.63,1762.442,"They must do that, or just... they'll be nice guys and will do it?"
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1762.442,1765.566,We have no position on whether a State court would be required to do that.
1993.92-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.588,1775.692,Are there cases in which State courts apply the doctrine of primary jurisdiction with respect to a Federal agency?
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1777.272,1778.945,"I'm not aware of a specific case, Your Honor, no."
1993.92-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.945,1779.255,"I'm not, either."
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1790.751,1800.008,"We think that's an open question, yes, and we also think that, as I said, it arises no matter what the decision is on the private right question, and that the question should be looked at independently."
1993.92-97,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1819.049,1826.855,I should think the airlines and the Congress would be quite amazed that the enactment of the anti-head-tax statute took away a Federal defense in State courts.
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1826.855,1849.16,"We think the defense remains in one guise or another, and for instance, we think it would be quite appropriate for an airline to pay this tax under protest and then either sue for a refund or, for instance, go straight to the Secretary at that point, having paid the tax, and ask the Secretary to entertain a reasonableness challenge."
1993.92-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.3,1877.059,"Mr. DuMont, what's your response to the assertion that none of this is properly before us because if we acknowledged your contention we would expand the relief below and therefore this can't be entertained?"
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1877.059,1880.462,"Well, as you said before, Your Honor, that issue is fairly joined."
1993.92-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.862,1911.373,The remand has not been challenged?
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1911.373,1916.505,"The remand has not been challenged as it relates to crash, fire, and rescue costs."
1993.92-97,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.505,1918.027,How do we determine that?
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1918.027,1923.671,The... because there was no cross-petition filed on that particular issue.
1993.92-97,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.671,1936.479,"But if we were to say there is no private right of action, then the respondent would lose the benefit of the... or the petitioner would lose the benefit of the remand on that issue."
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1936.479,1938.392,"We don't think that's necessarily true, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.022,1965.158,"Even if we were to say there's no private right of action, nonetheless the case would go back to the district court for deciding the proper allocation of the CFR fees?"
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1965.158,1972.292,"Assuming the parties are not able to resolve that issue amicably in light of this Court's decision, it would go back for remand on that one particular issue."
1993.92-97,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1972.292,1981.298,"Well, if we were to decide this, that there's no private cause of action, is that jurisdictional, then, for the district court?"
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1985.121,1987.224,"We don't think so, again, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.549,2017.064,"May I ask you a question about your argument on the merits, assuming it's here for a second."
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2039.618,2044.831,I'm not aware of a formal proceeding that has been brought under the AAIA on that issue.
1993.92-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.831,2055.768,"So there's really no law on this issue about whether a surplus can sometimes be too large, or something, or they can review it after the fact, because that statute speaks in terms of conditions for a monetary grant, as I understand it."
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2055.768,2058.382,There is no decisional law on that issue.
1993.92-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.003,2077.092,But those would be standards that would apply--
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2077.092,2077.994,--the unlimited accumulation of surpluses.
1993.92-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.994,2086.87,--in advance to future grants of money to... are there any proceedings where a particular airport authority has been punished in any way or sanctioned in any way for failure to comply with that statute?
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2086.87,2088.342,I'm not aware of any.
1993.92-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.014,2093.505,"Before the money is delivered, yes."
1993.92-97,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2093.505,2098.828,"Before the money is delivered, or without the necessity to resort to a former adversarial proceeding before the Secretary."
1993.92-97,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.332,2181.372,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2183.415,2187.488,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.393,2244.296,"You say, Mr. Hunting, that the crash, fire, and rescue charges are not at issue?"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2244.296,2246.787,"They are not at issue, and if I could explain further--"
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.787,2258.395,"You agree that no matter what happens here, you've lost on that, and the district court should, on remand, decide that issue as though there is a private right of action."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2258.395,2259.737,"--Yes, but I need to define loss."
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.352,2268.663,Right.
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2268.663,2270.723,We did not appeal that decision.
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.5,2292.907,And will not interpose the absence of any private right of action even if that were to be the conclusion of this Court.
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2292.907,2295.07,I am authorized to so represent.
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.72,2328.64,"Do you further represent that you cannot do it, even if you wanted to, or are you just being a good fellow?"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2328.64,2332.583,"I believe that I could not do it, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.583,2342.09,"Well, but you certainly can't represent that the district judge when he looks at the case and reads our opinion that can argue... we may say there's no cause of action here... might say, well, there's nothing for me to do, then."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2343.64,2345.583,I would not--
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2345.583,2349.024,"Even though you urged him otherwise, faithfully to your representation to us?"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2349.024,2355.418,"--I think among the permutations that could arise from the unusual circumstance we have, that could be one of the permutations."
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.98,2362.133,"But if that happened, the petitioner would lose the benefit of a portion of his judgment."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2362.133,2385.227,"--In that event, if the district judge were to abstain, or to decline to take the case, or to defer it to the agency, under any one of those somewhat similar scenarios it would go to the agency, and we would then expect to abide by whatever the agency decision was on the allocation of CFR costs that are imposed under FAA rules and regulations."
1993.92-97,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2385.227,2392.223,"But the agency then... the agency would not be precluded by what the Sixth Circuit determined in this case, would it?"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2393.723,2415.718,"Well, I think in a sense that all the Sixth Circuit decided was that it could not be 100 percent allocation to the commercial airlines, so I would submit to this Court that the agency would at least be bound by the narrow decision and the law of the case as it relates to this particular action, that the CFR costs could not in fact be 100-percent allocated to the commercial airlines."
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.718,2419.591,But the law of the case would be there never was a private cause of action in the first place.
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2421.893,2422.732,"We recognize that, and I--"
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.732,2424.124,That's the law of the other part of the case.
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2424.354,2443.345,"--I will be candid to acknowledge that it's with some reluctance that... having prevailed at the lower court that we've raised the issue, but we raised the issue at the trial court level dealing with the private cause of action as well as exhaustion of administrative remedies and other related concepts of deference to primary jurisdiction."
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2443.345,2444.858,"No, but you did not cross-petition on it."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2444.858,2452.671,"We did not cross-petition, and we are not seeking to expand relief that could be obtained by the airport or relief that would be detrimental to the airlines."
1993.92-97,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2650.22,2655.134,"Apart from that, is there a reason why the break was given to general aviation?"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2655.134,2657.346,--There are several reasons.
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.13,2714.772,Do I understand you to be arguing it would be too difficult to collect a landing fee from a private aircraft?
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2714.772,2715.223,No.
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.928,2729.053,"I understand that, but then I thought you went on to say because you don't know what the schedule is you couldn't collect a uniform fee from the general aviation--"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2729.053,2731.786,"With general aviation, there is... these are not scheduled landings."
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.786,2732.116,--I understand that.
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2732.116,2733.595,So it is--
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.595,2735.037,Every time they land the tower knows--
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2735.037,2736.146,--The tower knows.
1993.92-97,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.974,2747.784,--It's certainly not impossible.
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2747.784,2748.956,"No, it is not impossible."
1993.92-97,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2748.956,2749.747,But you're saying--
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2757.49,2763.334,I don't believe that it's any intentional decision to prefer this particular category.
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.18,2820.783,"Mr. Smith doesn't concede that, does he--"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2820.783,2821.253,"No, he does--"
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.253,2825.043,--that the concession fees are not covered by the AHTA?
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2825.043,2831.088,"--He does not concede that, no, and I did not mean to suggest that he did."
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.275,2873.906,"Well, I don't know how... I think it's a good argument, frankly."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2894.8,2898.784,We... it could be considered a charge on the persons traveling.
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.215,2904.577,"--Oh, really?"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2905.276,2906.969,It would not--
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.969,2907.52,Directly or indirectly?
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2907.52,2909.149,--Directly or indirectly.
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2909.149,2910.381,"Other charge, directly or indirectly?"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,2916.376,2941.381,"I... there certainly could be a mandatory aspect of the question you ask, but I do not believe that the charge for that facility is covered by the Anti-Head-Tax Act, and I would suggest, Your Honor, that perhaps the simplest analysis of whether concessions are included in section 1513(a) of the Anti-Head-Tax Act is to analyze the argument of the airlines."
1993.92-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2997.457,3003.591,"Mr. Hunting, I'm perplexed as to why the Secretary hasn't gotten involved in this thing more."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,3023.005,3046.801,"I would suggest something that I think is outside the record, but yet I think is certainly known, and that is that in many instances with other airports there have been leases that could be of duration, 10, 20, or 30 years, so that these charges have been established in one form or another by negotiated leases that cover long periods of time."
1993.92-97,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3158.263,3168.349,"Are you then taking issue with Mr. Smith, who said because it was cut off so early in the district court they didn't have a chance to show that general aviation coincides with intrastate traffic?"
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,3168.349,3168.979,I am.
1993.92-97,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3204.302,3218.671,"Is it your position that the airlines can't be in a deficiency position coming to court, that they have to pay and complain later, is that... it's only a refund that they can get."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,3226.946,3231.661,"If I could explain to you specifically what we have done in our instance, I would hope that would answer you."
1993.92-97,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3268.574,3270.577,I mean for the future.
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,3291.919,3299.654,"We are saying that the resort in the first instance for the airlines, if they are to challenge reasonableness, is to go to the agency."
1993.92-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.988,3323.33,"Thank you, Mr. Hunting."
1993.92-97,2,44957,william_f_hunting_jr,,3323.33,3323.661,Thank you very much.
1993.92-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3323.661,3326.323,"Mr. Smith, you have 2 minutes remaining."
1993.92-97,3,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,3326.323,3327.124,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-97,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3429.05,3430.823,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
