1986.85-1630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,43.499,"Mr. Saylor, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,43.499,46.562,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.322,181.009,Was there ever a judgment that the use of secret testimony was illegal?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,181.009,181.712,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.719,208.28,To the district court?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,208.28,217.964,"--To the district court, I'm sorry, to consider petitioner's claim of entitlement to immunity based on the statement of the law articulated by the Third Circuit."
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.476,243.299,What if the district court... what did the district court hold on remand?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,243.299,245.032,--That the officials were immune.
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,248.469,252.311,"Well, what it it had held that they were not immune?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,257.168,258.293,"Correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.293,273.835,Because there would have been a judgment already... it would have been required by the court of appeals' holding or opinion for the district court to say that the use of the secret testimony was violative of due process?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,273.835,283.377,"On remand, Your Honor, the court of appeals instructed the district court to enter summary judgment for Helms unless it found the officials to be immune."
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.377,284.174,"Right, right."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,284.174,285.454,And it also--
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.454,289.453,"So that, the district court had nothing more to do with the law?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,289.453,294.701,"--That's correct, except to determine whether that law was clearly established at the time of the--"
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,294.701,295.404,"Exactly, exactly."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,301.339,301.886,--Correct.
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.902,311.163,You say that isn't equivalent to his having obtained a declaratory judgment?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,311.163,312.882,"Not even close, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.208,329.894,But if no immunity... you enter summary judgment--
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,329.894,333.331,"On the damage issue, not a declaratory judgment."
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.331,341.641,--As a predicate to... before you order damages you have to find that somebody has done something wrong.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,341.641,343.797,You have to determine the law applicable to the facts.
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,343.797,345.374,And the court of appeals determined it.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,345.374,345.858,Right.
1986.85-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,345.858,346.608,Okay.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,346.608,350.091,"Favorable decision on the law, a far cry from declaratory judgment."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.403,361.276,"On that point, General, will you just refresh my recollection."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,368.196,373.523,"To convict him of prison misconduct, Your Honor, based on his involvement in a prison riot."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,373.523,377.755,"So, his prison record included in effect a finding of guilt of some kind of prison misconduct?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,377.755,378.162,Correct.
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.162,381.598,"And wouldn't that clear his record, though?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,386.378,390.907,"Your Honor, Helms had asked for three forms of relief."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.892,393.47,Right.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,393.47,402.858,"He asked for declaratory judgment, and he asked for an injunction enjoining prison officials from doing certain things, but also to expunge his record."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.858,403.623,Correct.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,403.623,405.996,He never got an injunction.
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,415.992,427.16,"Well, he abandoned it, but isn't the effect of what the court of appeals held... I mean, I can't imagine they still have on his record the fact that he is guilty of a crime for which there is no evidence, or do they?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,427.16,428.347,I don't know.
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.347,436.657,"I mean, even if they weren't ordered to take it out, wouldn't one, if later on it came up for review, say another charge or something, let's see how many prior violations do you have."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,441.435,442.607,"I think that is a fair statement, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.607,444.012,Isn't that of some benefit to him?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,444.012,448.136,"No, because he didn't get an expungement."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.246,453.604,"Because it wasn't a formal order of expungement, but as I understand you it was tantamount to an expungement?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,453.604,454.245,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,462.962,464.805,We are not communicating.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,464.805,466.164,--I don't... a statement of the law--
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.164,467.726,We are not communicating.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,478.114,478.802,--I am sorry.
1986.85-1630,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.419,498.107,"That statement of law might be wrong, might it not?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,505.025,505.619,--That is correct.
1986.85-1630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,520.318,521.832,Is he incarcerated again?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,521.832,525.145,"I saw a reference to that in respondent's brief, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,532.096,533.658,He is back in what?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,533.658,535.579,"He is back in prison, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,535.579,538.469,We will resume at 1:00 o'clock.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,554.118,557.242,"May it please the Court, Justice Stevens asked a question."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.657,580.282,"Well, I guess he's back in now."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,580.282,588.077,"That's my understanding, but he was reincarcerated after this litigation had been concluded, even the fees portion, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,588.077,599.949,"So, what you are saying is, even if one could construe the proceedings as removing the stigma of conviction, whatever it is, it really wouldn't have made him a prevailing party because he had no interest in the nature of his prison record after he was released?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,599.949,600.526,"Correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.466,634.966,"Well, that won't really happen."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,650.634,651.369,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,651.369,653.008,I think that's right.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,654.959,658.333,"Well, we could have petitioned for certiorari."
1986.85-1630,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.333,659.301,"Well, we wouldn't have taken it."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,659.911,662.754,In effect it couldn't have been appealed.
1986.85-1630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.754,670.611,"Of course, we took one part of the case on petition for certiorari when it was not final."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,670.611,672.735,"Yes, Your Honor, the administrative custody issue."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.098,781.364,May I ask one other question.
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,782.972,783.55,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,783.55,789.454,"And when we reviewed the custody issue, had he already been released from prison?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,789.454,791.688,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.812,797.859,I guess we... did we review a moot case then?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,802.2,805.075,"No, Your Honor, because his claim for damages was still clearly alive."
1986.85-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.075,811.058,"--But the administrative custody issue, did that involve the claim for damages or was that injunctive relief?"
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,811.058,811.464,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.243,814.634,"Right, okay."
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,818.477,822.867,Was it--
1986.85-1630,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.867,825.006,Was it less than final?
1986.85-1630,0,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,833.704,834.564,--That's correct.
1986.85-1630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,847.855,851.667,"Thank you, Mr. Saylor."
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,853.964,864.21,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.399,1015.461,--directed the entry of a declaratory judgment in his favor--
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1015.461,1020.99,"Well, then it would have ruled that he was entitled to relief and I think we would have a substantially different--"
1986.85-1630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.99,1028.971,"--No, no, but no other... is a declaratory judgment by itself without any claim for damages a basis for a fee?"
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1028.971,1031.579,--It could be a basis for a fee.
1986.85-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.379,1074.423,"Mr. Wallace, I am right here."
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1091.464,1095.132,"Exactly so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.396,1106.191,"But before you get them all out here, he got more than a declaration of law."
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1111.721,1117.781,That is... one could call it a declaration.
1986.85-1630,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.457,1148.91,I think that overstates it a little.
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1162.078,1167.092,--It remanded the case for a determination of the--
1986.85-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.092,1176.432,"And is it not true that it is also a judicial statement that could have been made the subject of a petition for certiorari to this Court if you wanted to review it, if Pennsylvania wanted to."
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1176.432,1177.713,--It could have.
1986.85-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.713,1182.979,And there would have been no jurisdictional objection even though it would have been non-final and as a matter of discretion we probably would have denied it.
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1182.979,1189.82,It is equally true that a petition for certiorari before a judgment could have been filed before the court of appeals had ruled at all.
1986.85-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.193,1199.285,"But they did in this very case, at that very time--"
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1199.285,1207.455,"The Court did... in this very case with respect to an issue that it concluded warranted review, but that is a rather exceptional circumstance."
1986.85-1630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.877,1214.765,"--Well, all we did was we granted certiorari from a judgment of the court of appeals."
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1214.765,1215.718,That is correct.
1986.85-1630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1215.718,1221.388,"And before it was final, but there is no need for finality from the federal court."
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1221.388,1222.419,That is correct.
1986.85-1630,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.824,1251.408,"If the same thing happened in a court system, in a state court system and the same thing happened at the intermediate state court level and then it went down to the court of first instance, there would have been no way unless the Supreme Court of the state had... and was as liberal as we are on interlocutory appeals, there would have been no appeal of right of that dictum, in any case."
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1263.716,1291.345,"That is correct, Mr. Justice, nor would there have been any right of review from this Court in the hypothetical case I have posited where it was purely dictum by the court of appeals which was affirming the rejection of his claim but which I think is the functional equivalent for purposes of whether he was a prevailing party because he got no more and no less than he would have gotten in that situation."
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.345,1298.062,And they should have given a declaratory judgment?
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1298.062,1304.576,"Well, then he would have prevailed to that extent, because the--"
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1304.576,1305.528,Wouldn't he be entitled to--
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1305.528,1309.776,"--The court would have ruled that he was entitled to a declaratory judgment, then."
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1309.776,1311.479,--Would he then be entitled to attorney's fees?
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1311.479,1316.791,He would at least be entitled if he met the--
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.791,1318.539,"So, the magic words are, he should have granted?"
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1318.539,1322.585,--The court of appeals--
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1322.585,1324.022,The court said that he was entitled to it.
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1328.552,1329.99,"--Well, they--"
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.99,1331.49,Are we quibbling on words?
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1331.49,1349.561,"--No, Mr. Justice, because by the time the court of appeals ruled, he was not in jail and there was a serious question about whether a declaratory judgment should issue on the supposition that he might commit another crime and go back to jail sometime in the future."
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1357.778,1362.089,They said he was entitled... they didn't say injunctive relief or declaratory judgment.
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1362.089,1362.902,That's right.
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.902,1364.682,But he was entitled to relief.
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1364.682,1367.087,"Well, they didn't say he was entitled to relief."
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.617,1372.899,"It surely is, in words."
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1372.899,1378.913,"Well, they said his right had been violated and he'll get damages unless there's immunity."
1986.85-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1380.303,1382.74,I don't read it that way.
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1399.452,1400.187,Yes.
1986.85-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.542,1418.337,"You don't think if he had asked for it, that he could have had that order expunged, the misconduct?"
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1418.337,1432.971,Probably not because he was no longer in jail and the only basis on which his case would not be moot would be for the court to be willing to assume he might commit another crime and go back to jail.
1986.85-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.971,1435.502,"Or he might be asked to fill out an employment application on,"
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1445.499,1447.264,I don't think so.
1986.85-1630,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.264,1450.434,"Mr. Wallace, what about the opportunity for gamesmanship?"
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1478.407,1486.233,Someone can be a prevailing party if the defendant has taken voluntary action that moots out his claim.
1986.85-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.165,1508.227,"But he was paroled and that is what mooted his claim, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1511.694,1512.772,Yes.
1986.85-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.772,1515.63,And I take it that was... they didn't have to parole him?
1986.85-1630,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1515.63,1522.159,"Well, but those standards have nothing to do with whether he had a pending claim."
1986.85-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.065,1530.016,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1531.656,1546.011,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.349,1681.004,You are talking about expressed language of legislative history?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1681.004,1681.535,--Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.723,1684.426,And not--
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1684.426,1691.049,"Words, ""important matter"" in the course of litigation are the specific words that I am referring to."
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1691.049,1698.094,"--So, now we talk about expressed language in the statute but about expressed language in the legislative history?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1698.094,1703.781,"Well, the reason we have to go back to that, Your Honor, I believe is if we look at the statutory language."
1986.85-1630,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.406,1748.418,"Well, that may well have been what the Committee in question had in mind."
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1762.742,1765.632,"Yes, I think the word is in fact that ambiguous."
1986.85-1630,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.632,1767.693,"--""Prevailing party in litigation""?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1767.693,1768.35,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.35,1771.129,I wouldn't have thought that.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1810.332,1819.485,"Well, I don't think it invites lawsuits because what in fact invites lawsuits is the fact that someone's constitutional rights have been violated."
1986.85-1630,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.133,1849.384,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1851.337,1871.049,"The damage concept in that regard, it's the concept of attorney's fees is a shifting of cost and I answer you this way because the issue of damages is divorced from the decision that Congress made as to the shifting of cost."
1986.85-1630,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.108,1890.448,"But the doctrine of official immunity, I think means that an officer when he performs his duties shouldn't have to worry about having to pay a lot of money out of his own pocket."
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1906.363,1913.471,I think the simple answer to that was the answer that was given by this Court in the Pulliam versus Allen case.
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.576,1934.758,The very fact that the conclusion does prove troubling is some reason to look closely at whether Congress really mandated it.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1946.832,1960.967,"Well, I don't believe it is in fact that illogical, because what you have is, you have an expressed desire by Congress that in these certain situations where these policies have been furthered, we are going to shift the costs."
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.994,1980.227,And the Congress exercised that power by saying that a prevailing party should recover attorneys' fees.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1980.227,1980.602,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.602,1982.086,But that's what Congress said.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1982.086,1982.539,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.539,1989.709,"And you're asking us to draw what may seem to some of us quite an illogical conclusion from it, and you are saying that Congress directed us to do it."
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,1992.927,2010.187,"No, I agree that in fact, if you read the statute, that very little guidance is going to be given to the Court and that's why I have gone to the legislative history as really the only other alternative we have to, you know, receive guidance from Congress on this issue."
1986.85-1630,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2010.187,2026.257,"Mr. Vesely, if the court below had decided the question of immunity first and had found that the officers had immunity for their actions, I suppose you wouldn't be here claiming attorney's fees?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2026.257,2026.679,That is correct.
1986.85-1630,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.24,2043.564,"Well, why should the result be any different if at the end of the line they determine there is immunity, but in the meantime have something to say about the merits?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2045.736,2048.626,I am not sure I understand Your Honor's question.
1986.85-1630,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2048.626,2058.949,"Well, suppose at the end of the line when the case is all over and done with, the court decides the officers are immune."
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2058.949,2059.637,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2059.637,2069.4,But in the process of doing that makes comments in the course of the opinion about the merits of the underlying violation.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2071.726,2089.83,"I think in situations where they have... you have to remember that the nature of how the judgment was... I think in situations where they have in fact made a judgement on the merits as to the constitutional violation, yes, I think in every one of those circumstances attorneys' fees should be awarded regardless of concepts of immunity."
1986.85-1630,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.83,2090.985,What do you mean by a judgment?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2099.671,2103.857,"Well, the dictum then wouldn't be a judgment on the merits."
1986.85-1630,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2109.403,2112.138,But all these are live cases of controversy.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2118.634,2119.009,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.009,2121.399,"And the officer comes back and says,"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2162.341,2163.355,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.355,2166.354,And I suppose it isn't any bar to a declaratory judgment.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2166.354,2171.26,I believe that both those were involved in the Pulliam case.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.26,2179.789,And the court of appeals here said that this complaint included a claim for a declaratory judgment.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2180.21,2180.554,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.535,2196.673,So even if there had been a holding of immunity that wouldn't have entered the case?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2196.673,2197.095,No.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.137,2219.228,But what do you think wasn't mooted out by his release?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2219.228,2221.227,What wasn't mooted out?
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.227,2221.696,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2221.696,2224.82,His damage claim was not mooted out.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2224.82,2230.819,Was not mooted out by his release?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2230.819,2238.456,"Yes, and this Court has repeatedly held that you can receive a declaratory judgment as a predicate to a damage claim."
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.456,2245.282,You almost have to... you almost have to whether you call it a declaratory judgment or not.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2250.749,2267.851,"Yes, you do, but it is possible, one of the ways that that could be avoided would be, even if... a 12-B motion, I would think, would be the way around it, to basically say under the facts... even if we assume everything he said is true, he would have qualified immunity."
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.851,2280.894,"Well, what if a plaintiff in a case similar to this sues for damages and says, my rights have been violated by these prison regulations or prison practices and I want a judgment for damages."
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2299.059,2300.793,"Yes, I believe they can."
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.793,2301.808,Under what theory?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2307.338,2317.694,"No, I don't believe that that's... for one, if we consider that to be a declaratory judgment, the Declaratory Judgment Act specifically says that declaratory Judgments are reviewable."
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.154,2345.853,"So, then we are going to expand the class of appealable orders from the district court by virtue of the potential for attorneys' fees?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2345.853,2349.305,"Well, I don't necessarily think... I am not saying we expand that."
1986.85-1630,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.241,2410.188,"You would also agree, wouldn't you, that you are going to have more appealable orders under your theory than under your opponent's theory, officials are going to be able to appeal more often and will probably be motivated to appeal more often?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2410.188,2415.435,"Well, I... the reality is, I would have to say yes."
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.245,2550.51,"When this case was here before, he had already been released from prison?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2550.51,2551.446,That's correct.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.446,2559.178,And his only interest at that time in the case was the fact that there was a damages claim pending?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2559.178,2559.6,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.6,2568.097,He could at that time get no personal benefit out of the declaratory judgment phase of the case?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2568.097,2568.987,Well--
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.987,2578.312,"I think we noted, didn't we, at that time that the court of appeals had said that the secret testimony violated his rights?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2578.312,2578.765,--Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.765,2580.499,And then we remanded?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2580.499,2581.062,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.062,2584.624,Because that issue was still in the case and it might be a ground for damages?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2584.624,2585.124,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.124,2602.899,"Well, but at that time, if his only interest was in the damages, how could he have gotten any benefit out of just the fact that the court of appeals had made this declaration?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2602.899,2608.895,"Well, the simple answer to that, Your Honor, is I don't--"
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.895,2610.536,Do you have to get to the catalyst argument?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2610.536,2626.531,"--I don't find the vindication of my constitutional rights as not of personal benefit, and I think you have to... to go along with the opposition's argument you have to make that determination that the thing that Congress, in fact, created this statute--"
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.531,2631.871,"Well, why isn't the answer to that, that... supposing there hadn't been a damages claim in the case?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2631.871,2634.73,--Suppose there had not been?
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.73,2635.355,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2635.355,2636.011,Yes.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.011,2637.931,Wouldn't the case have been moot?
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2637.931,2639.821,"Yes, it probably would have, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2639.821,2648.069,"Well, whether or not the vindication of your constitutional rights as a personal injury, it would have been moot, the case would have been over?"
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2648.069,2648.724,It was not in this case.
1986.85-1630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.724,2659.736,"Well, only because the damages were still alive, but aside from the damages, the declaratory judgment phase was really a dead issue."
1986.85-1630,2,40677,robert_harold_vesely,,2659.736,2665.248,"Well, it's dead to the extent that it had already been decided."
1986.85-1630,3,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,3272.556,3292.656,"Briefly, Your Honor, in drafting the fee statute Congress struck a balance, and that is clear from the legislative history, between encouraging civil rights suits to vindicate rights, on the one hand, and fairness to the defendants that have to pay attorneys' fees on the other hand."
1986.85-1630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3367.754,3374.626,Suppose... the new regulations were the result of his lawsuit?
1986.85-1630,3,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,3405.521,3409.457,"Under the facts of this case... can I answer that in two parts, please, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.316,3413.112,I know you don't want to accept part of my--
1986.85-1630,3,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,3413.112,3414.283,--I will answer your hypothetical first.
1986.85-1630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.283,3414.737,--All right.
1986.85-1630,3,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,3414.737,3427.857,"Yes, if the State changes its practices in response to a lawsuit so that the effect of that change or cessation is to moot plaintiff's claim, I think plaintiff is a prevailing party and entitled to fees."
1986.85-1630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.857,3430.903,"Well, I know, but you still haven't answered my question."
1986.85-1630,3,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,3449.365,3455.364,"That's correct, because he wouldn't have benefited nor would have any party who he represented, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3467.093,3483.946,"So, even if he was the cause of the new regulations he gets no attorney's fee if he is released... if he is released prior to the adoption of the regs, or at the same time?"
1986.85-1630,3,43311,thomas_g_saylor_jr,,3483.946,3484.805,"Correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1630,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.805,3487.243,Thank you.
1986.85-1630,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3487.243,3489.681,"Thank you, Mr. Saylor."
