1991.90-1126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.131,"We will hear argument next in No. 90-1126, Barbara Norman v. Dorothy Reed, and 90-1435, Cook County Officers Electoral Board v. Dorothy Reed."
1991.90-1126,0,40162,robert_e_pincham_jr,,44.359,47.792,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.233,109.365,"Mr. Pincham, is it the same party?"
1991.90-1126,0,40162,robert_e_pincham_jr,,112.887,113.659,"Indeed it is, Your Honor."
1991.90-1126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,145.692,149.682,How do... how do we know that it was the same party?
1991.90-1126,0,40162,robert_e_pincham_jr,,149.682,151.064,The record is--
1991.90-1126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.064,161.781,"All the record says, if I recollect it, is that the city Harold Washington Party had no objection to the use of the name."
1991.90-1126,0,40162,robert_e_pincham_jr,,161.781,163.894,"--Actually it went further than that, Your Honor."
1991.90-1126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.991,209.654,Was that evident to those who had to make the initial judgment--
1991.90-1126,0,40162,robert_e_pincham_jr,,209.654,210.576,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,210.576,213.888,--as to whether the party had the proper number of signatures?
1991.90-1126,0,40162,robert_e_pincham_jr,,221.472,223.014,"Yes, indeed it was."
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,987.569,990.901,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1146.448,1154.503,"Mr. Gillis, is the question concerning that rule one of the ones included in the petition for certiorari?"
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1154.503,1155.852,I believe it was.
1991.90-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1167.102,1171.604,"Now your client, which as I understand it, is the Board of Elections--"
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1171.604,1171.794,Right.
1991.90-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1174.555,1194.759,"--held or decided that the Harold Washington Party candidates did not qualify for the... is it the Sanitary District Offices... where the suburbs elect, and they simply represent the suburbs only."
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1194.759,1202.044,"--Well, that issue did not get by... that was not decided by the Illinois Supreme Court, so I do not believe that issue is before the Court."
1991.90-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.977,1212.52,"Well, the Supreme Court of Illinois didn't upset that determination, did it?"
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1212.52,1213.432,No.
1991.90-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.354,1226.071,"Mr. Gillis, it may well be a harsh rule, but what is wrong with a State rule that does not require you to run on a slate?"
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1250.577,1259.353,"I think to run with a political party, to run with other persons of a like mind set and a like platform, is a political advantage."
1991.90-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.674,1276.684,"Well, that may be, but it seems to me a State can say, you know, voters are going to be misled."
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1295.931,1299.514,I really see no State interest in requiring a complete slate.
1991.90-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1303.007,1304.739,That's not my hypothetical.
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1317.81,1332.959,"--Well, one vice to that is Moore v. Ogilvie, which if you required them to get a complete slate in both the city and the county, a party could be quite popular and show a modicum of support in one district, but not in the other."
1991.90-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.59,1336.552,You're not listening to... I am not requiring them to get a slate.
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1347.22,1359.067,"--I think it's... I'm sorry, I think it violates the requirement that if a person... party qualifies in one district that they should be on the ballot as happened in this case."
1991.90-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.376,1379.794,"Well, isn't it true also that in this case, the petitions, at least the ones at the beginning of the appendix, for the 19 candidates, were the 19 that were elected either from Chicago or county wide."
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1383.668,1384.299,That's right.
1991.90-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.468,1387.268,So there wasn't any danger of the kind of confusion.
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1395.586,1395.964,"--No, I am."
1991.90-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.065,1397.235,You are.
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1405.48,1414.085,"Yes, because only 7,008 signatures were brought forth and the board found that that does not show a modicum of support."
1991.90-1126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1416.168,1423.302,"Would 25,000 signatures have been the required number in the suburban area for suburban candidates?"
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1423.302,1423.462,--Right.
1991.90-1126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1424.333,1438.15,"Mr. Gillis, you know, I simply can't find in the questions presented, in either petition, a question on the whole slate question."
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1443.106,1451.852,"When the supreme court... I'm sorry, I may have used a shorthand, but when the Supreme Court held that by failing to qualify in the suburbs--"
1991.90-1126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1451.852,1452.663,The Illinois Supreme Court?
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1452.663,1461.02,"--The Illinois Supreme Court's order said you failed to get enough signatures in the suburbs, then you're off the ballot entirely."
1991.90-1126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1465.352,1474.418,"Well, that may be, but I guess what we're looking at here, as far as I know, are the questions presented in these blue petitions."
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1482.705,1498.387,"Well, it is wrapped up in the issue about whether it's constitutionally permissible to take the complete... to take the Harold Washington Party off the ballot."
1991.90-1126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1503.669,1507.172,Which question do you say covers it?
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1507.172,1516.208,The first one: whether it's constitutionally impermissible to knock the Harold Washington Party off the ballot.
1991.90-1126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1536.34,1539.853,"Well, that would... you were reading from your argument, not your question."
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1539.853,1541.405,Yes.
1991.90-1126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1541.405,1542.445,I think that's part of the confusion.
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1542.445,1556.526,"Going to Justice Steven's point about the name, that is displayed in a transcript of August 21st at page 25, and August 24th at page 4."
1991.90-1126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.259,1600.415,"Well, what would be your position on a State law which required a complete slate within say, just the city of Chicago?"
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1606.738,1608.661,I don't think there's any State interest.
1991.90-1126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1614.585,1623.951,Is it because it's not indicative of the existence of a viable party that it can field candidates for all of the ballot positions?
1991.90-1126,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1623.951,1628.456,--I think it's discriminatory against new political parties.
1991.90-1126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.652,1710.314,"Thank you, Mr. Gillis."
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1713.018,1717.609,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.949,1803.732,"May I ask at that point, is that the petition at page 4 of the joint appendix?"
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1803.732,1804.643,"--Yes, it is."
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.643,1810.557,And the only names on that are the 19 candidates who either ran from the city or ran county wide.
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1810.757,1810.908,Yes.
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.848,1848.049,--Maybe that's right.
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1855.836,1856.277,That's correct.
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.277,1859.86,"And the second is the group that go the 7,800 or whatever it is."
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1859.86,1860.07,That's correct.
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.07,1863.823,"Now, were they two separate petitions, or are they two parts of the same petition?"
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1863.823,1865.886,"They were submitted as part of the same petition, I believe."
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.886,1866.086,I see.
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1870.791,1871.712,That's correct.
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1879.155,1884.31,--But you would not have been able to make the argument if they'd simply omitted the second part?
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1891.126,1892.265,"--No, I would have a different objection."
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.054,1908.658,For all offices to be filled throughout the State or throughout the area from... throughout the area that you're petitioning from?
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1908.658,1912.962,--For that... for the particular contest that you are petitioning to run in.
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.962,1917.864,In the particular context on page 1 was county wide and commissioners from Chicago.
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1917.864,1922.688,But the contest included the election of commissioners from the city and from the suburbs.
1991.90-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1922.688,1925.67,"Well, it also included running for Governor, possibly, too."
1991.90-1126,2,24884,gregory_a_adamski,,1925.67,1926.121,It didn't.
