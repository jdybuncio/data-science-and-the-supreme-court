1982.8_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.779,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 8 Original, the State of Arizona against the State of California and others."
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,15.021,24.578,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like first to give a brief statement of the background of the case before commencing argument."
1982.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.464,299.077,Did he say it would be res judicata or law of the case?
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,299.077,303.501,--He stated it would be res judicata ware these claims to be made in another proceeding.
1982.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.501,304.971,"Oh, I see."
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,304.971,315.62,"In this particular instance, he referred, to avoid that bar, he states that Article IX of the Court's decree permits the reopening of that issue."
1982.8_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,426.281,438.669,What do you suggest was the purpose in the original report and action of this Court in leaving some of these matters open for adjustments?
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,438.669,468.408,"The adjustment that I believe the Chief Justice refers to would be the boundary adjustments in Article II(D)(5) of the decree, and that is a specific provision that permits the reopening for a specific purpose, and I will indicate that the condition of reopening for that purpose has not been met in this case, but with regard to Article IX, that is... I might call it a phrase of art."
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.705,512.498,"I suppose if the use of Article IX made here is acceptable, one of the states or the lower basin states... basin states, either one could ask to relitigate the division of water--"
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,512.498,514.41,Precisely.
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,537.982,539.995,"--This wouldn't be the last of it, either."
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,539.995,540.814,"Indeed, it would not."
1982.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,633.366,643.972,"Were the boundaries in dispute, all those that had federal lands on one side and tribal lands on the other?"
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,643.972,653.278,"To my recollection, there are federal lands abutting the Indian reservations in the case of Fort Mojave and Colorado River."
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.253,676.584,What did we do with that determination?
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,676.584,695.977,"This Court adopted the irrigable acreage that was computed based on the boundary determination, adopted the water allocated dependent on the amount of acreage so computed, but rejected the findings as to the boundaries as being unnecessary."
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.977,697.457,"Well, we set it aside."
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,701.34,708.215,"This Court did not adopt the boundary findings, though it did adopt the acreage that was calculated--"
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.215,708.546,"--Yes, yes."
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,708.546,709.024,--on those boundaries.
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.024,709.705,Yes.
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,721.924,724.425,This Court did not determine the boundaries--
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.425,726.716,What is II(D)(5)?
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,727.366,753.724,"--II(D)(5) provides in setting forth the allocations of water for the different reservations, that provision states that these allocations with respect to Fort Mojave and the Colorado River Indian Reservation, that the allocations being adopted by this Court that Master Rifkind found were subject to adjustment in the event the boundaries are finally determined."
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.085,776.38,"Well, the Master thought that he was finally determining them, didn't he?"
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,785.725,809.89,"Master Rifkind had attempted to determine the boundaries, and it wasn't good enough for this Court, and I suggest that it wasn't good enough for this Court for the reason that this Court was concerned with the possibility that due to the states' participation, the parens patriae doctrine would bind other parties that might have land claims who were not parties to the suit."
1982.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,942.737,953.286,Have any actions been filed by the states separately to contest the boundaries as determined by the Secretary of Interior?
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,953.286,954.756,Yes.
1982.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.333,1002.057,The states don't claim any interest in the land itself.
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1010.512,1011.664,That is correct.
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.149,1088.894,"We are talking about what the boundaries of the reservations were when the suit was started, aren't we?"
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1088.894,1092.718,We are actually--
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.718,1097.449,We are talking about... What did Master Rifkind purport to find?
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1097.449,1099.63,--He rejected the--
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.63,1101.763,What kind of boundaries?
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1103.343,1110.308,--He essentially found with regard to the two reservations... there are five now that have boundary questions.
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.479,1112.809,Yes.
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1112.809,1125.598,"With respect to the Colorado River Indian Reservation, he found that the intended boundary, the west bank of the Colorado River, was to be the boundary as the river imperceptibly moved."
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.598,1125.979,Yes.
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1125.979,1130.15,The United States took a position that the boundary was a fixed boundary.
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.594,1140.418,"Were these reservations established by Act of Congress, or by executive order, or by--"
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1140.418,1152.116,"--Some by executive order and some by Acts of Congress, and I can't tell you at this moment whether the Colorado River Indian Reservation was one or the other."
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.678,1172.45,"--But you are not... the question isn't whether or not that a reservation that had a... whose boundaries were not in dispute during this lawsuit could now be changed, and the boundaries just expanded."
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1173.822,1177.294,"--It is not the issue in that we have no land interest, and--"
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.294,1180.947,This is what is the accurate boundary at some time in the past.
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1180.947,1200.87,"--It is what the boundary was in the past, but the Secretary of the Interior in actions taken subsequently to the 1964 decree purports to restore lands, adding irrigable acreage, which he would like recognized as always having been part of the reservations."
1982.8_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.87,1201.261,Yes.
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1201.261,1236.343,"Now, we submit that when you consider all the acreage that it is possible to add to the reservations and give them additional water rights to the detriment of the State Parties, we feel that the United States has not met the condition of Article II(D)(5) that there have been a final determination of the boundaries for the purpose of modifying an adjudicated water right, a right of each of these reservations which resulted from a full adjudication."
1982.8_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.223,1421.423,"""Waive"" isn't really quite the right word, is it?"
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1424.535,1425.116,--Over... That is correct.
1982.8_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1497.074,1503.776,"--Counsel, you didn't refer to the case of Maryland versus Louisiana in connection with this intervention issue."
1982.8_orig,0,18336,carl_boronkay,,1509.199,1523.779,"--I believe it is distinguishable on the grounds that the states were already involved, and I didn't see any practical effect to be attained by the sovereign immunity question as to individuals."
1982.8_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.776,1538.111,Mr. Hunsaker?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,1538.111,1547.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as the Court is aware, there are two main categories of land which are involved in this matter."
1982.8_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1688.078,1701.216,"Mr. Hunsaker, to what extent does the larger amount of practically irrigable acreage found by the present Special Master come from examining new technology?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,1701.216,1727.952,"In that regard, there... most of the lands submitted by the tribes comes from the examination of new technology, so-called sprinkler and drip irrigation, and so virtually a large percent, and I cannot tell you the exact percentage now, but a large percent of the lands presented by the tribes themselves at this time comes from those technological advances."
1982.8_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1727.952,1737.419,"Well, is that land that couldn't be irrigated by other traditional methods that were in effect at the time of the previous decree?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,1737.419,1751.658,"No, the testimony in the case would indicate that these lands were somewhat hilly, and they could have been, I guess, leveled, but the economics of doing that may have been prohibitive."
1982.8_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1818.972,1833.673,Are you to be understood as saying that Article IX was not intended to allow a sort of newly discovered issue problem to be raised?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,1833.673,1839.965,"Well, Your Honor, I suppose in the proper context that a newly discovered issue could be raised."
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.421,1872.827,"Why... Assuming the tribes are properly in the case, why should the tribes be bound by the previous decision?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,1874.78,1881.724,They were parties in that the United States represented them at the hearing before the Special Master Rifkind.
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.849,1910.848,"Assume... Is there some claim in the case that the United States breached its trust, or did not properly represent the tribes at that time?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,1910.848,1917.981,"--Your Honor, that claim was discussed during the case, but we submit that the Special Master did not make any finding in that regard."
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.452,1943.516,But the preclusion of the tribe would depend upon... in this case would depend upon the adequate representation of the United States in the original decree?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,1943.516,1944.167,--That's right.
1982.8_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.883,1975.827,"Mr. Hunsaker, if the Court were to determine that the omitted lands issue recommendation of the new Special Master is erroneous, would the Court then have to remand on any question of conflict of interest as far as the tribes are concerned?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,1975.827,1981.403,--I believe that there is insufficient evidence.
1982.8_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.424,2008.1,The Special Master really... he wouldn't have gone to the questions of law of the case unless he had felt the Indians would be bound under some principles analogous to res judicata.
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2008.1,2010.081,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1982.8_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2334.634,2336.733,You say should have been.
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2339.826,2353.336,"--Your Honor, we... Mr. Chief Justice, we presented motions to the Master at a pretrial hearing that we be allowed to hear these issues before him."
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.606,2418.726,Have water rights been generally settled?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2423.181,2424.823,"Mr. Justice White, they have not."
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.371,2428.304,Is there some general adjudication in progress?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2428.304,2434.508,"--There is a general adjudication on some of the reservations that is in process, not on all."
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.779,2454.541,"Well, were they... were the adjudications going on in... the general adjudications going on in the state courts?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2454.541,2455.873,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.873,2461.165,What has the Ninth Circuit decision got to do with that?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2461.165,2461.696,"Well, their... Okay."
1982.8_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2503.793,2507.707,You mean the order of reference is the subject of the appeal?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2507.707,2508.748,I am sorry.
1982.8_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2509.147,2515.261,"The referring by the Federal District Court to the state courts, is that being challenged in the Ninth Circuit?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2515.261,2523.258,"Yes, Your Honor, and in addition to that, the question of the Constitution has been presented."
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.258,2541.667,"Well, whatever the standard was in this... in this case, it wouldn't necessarily prevent a different standard being applied in other proceedings with different parties, would it?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2541.667,2544.699,"Mr. Justice White, we have--"
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.699,2550.235,Especially if the different standard you are insisting upon originated in this Court.
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2550.235,2563.393,--We have great concerns that the state courts or the Federal District Court would feel bound by the standard set forth by this Court because it was instigated by the state courts.
1982.8_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.393,2563.823,"Well, which standard?"
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2565.245,2568.766,"Well, that's the thing that we feel there is some uncertainty about."
1982.8_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2704.554,2707.636,Which reservation was it proposed to grow grapes on?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2710.828,2729.592,"Well, I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that it is proposed essentially now on all reservations, because of the problem of drip and sprinkler irrigation which I talked about, but there was considerable evidence in particular about that on the Fort Yuma Reservation."
1982.8_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2729.592,2731.132,--That would be right by Yuma?
1982.8_orig,1,39441,ralph_hunsaker,,2731.132,2733.055,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.8_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2771.23,2772.93,Thank you.
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,2777.942,2795.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the tribes relied on the government's brief on the boundary dispute issue, and so I intend to defer that question to Mr. Claiborne, and proceed with the question of the omitted lands and the other issues raised by counsel for the states."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.569,2853.854,To what extent do you mean that the states admit the so-called gross error to which you refer?
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,2853.854,2875.575,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I say that because they admitted that 80 percent of the land claimed by the United States is practicably irrigable today and 50 percent of the combined claims of the tribes in the United States are irrigable today, and that is what their experts admitted in trial."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2928.293,2932.084,What you are arguing is just that the government was greedy enough the first time around.
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,2932.084,2939.589,"No, Your Honor, I wouldn't put it that way, and Special Master Tuttle didn't put it that way."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.589,2940.248,No.
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,2942.651,2959.551,"All that the tribes are asking for is to apply the same standard that was applied in the original case, practicably irrigable acres standard to determine what water should be allocated."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2959.551,2969.687,"Yes, but I asked you about what sort of a gross error it was that you claimed should allow this matter to be reopened after all these years."
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,2984.927,2993.963,"Your Honor, we are not merely saying that hindsight, that now because of hindsight it is apparent they made a mistake."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.899,3023.282,"Do you think in any other kind of a case, say, where there wasn't a Special Master, but just litigation between ordinary private parties, one party could come in 15 years later simply because it was an equitable decree and there had been a provision to allow reopening and saying under law of the case I now find that I want to reargue things that were settled 15 years ago?"
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3023.282,3026.755,"Not in the usual case that was 15 years old, Your Honor."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3053.643,3055.435,Why do you say that?
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3071.003,3078.019,"--Well, I suppose one thing it gets back to, Your Honor, is Article IX, which expressly provides for reopening."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3098.193,3098.753,But--
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3098.753,3100.032,--Pardon me.
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.032,3100.794,--Go ahead.
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3100.794,3109.339,"And they submitted this, Your Honor, on January 11th, 1963, long after the issue of equitable apportionment went out of the case."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.071,3123.479,Do you contend that Article IX would allow any party to reopen any question if they found that they simply hadn't made as strong claims as they now thought they should have?
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3123.479,3124.351,"No, Your Honor."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3124.351,3135.186,"Then how do you distinguish your claim from that of, say, the states, who might feel, as they apparently do, that had they asked for more, asked for it in a different way in '63, they would have gotten it?"
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3135.186,3165.258,"You can only justify reopening under the law of the case doctrine, which is this case... we are trying to reopen the same case... if you can find a gross error, where the other party had not changed his position and relied to his detriment, and as I will point out in a minute, none of the three parties which claimed to show reliance demonstrated it in the record."

1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3174.623,3175.755,"Right, Your Honor."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.416,3195.097,All other principals are bound by the acts of their attorneys.
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3197.639,3203.142,"Well, as Judge Tuttle pointed out, the Indians weren't even there by their own attorney."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.142,3203.933,"Well, but, so you don't think--"
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3203.933,3204.765,They were there by the government.
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.765,3207.115,"--Yes, but certainly under Heckman they are bound."
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3207.115,3212.138,"They are... Well, now, Heckman didn't discuss the issue of whether or--"
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3212.138,3214.06,Do you assert they are not bound?
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3214.06,3219.072,"--I... Yes, we allege inadequate representation, and we stick by that."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3219.813,3223.416,"But the Special Master didn't find in your favor on that, did he?"
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3223.416,3224.877,"--No, but he didn't find against us."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3267.944,3279.622,"Your definition of any grievous error, I suppose, is any claim that might have been made but wasn't, that you could open up any portion of the decree under that standard."
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3279.622,3286.087,"No, I would say you couldn't, Your Honor."
1982.8_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3885.818,3888.95,"You don't have to rely, then, on 1362."
1982.8_orig,2,34071,lawrence_a_aschenbrenner,,3888.95,3890.671,"No, Your Honor."
1982.8_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3912.194,3913.176,Very well.
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3922.603,3936.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before turning to the boundary lines, it might be useful to say one or two words in addition to what has been said by Mr. Aschenbrenner about the omitted lands question."
1982.8_orig,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4027.98,4044.922,"Do you think, Mr. Claiborne, that that language would normally be used to aid the parties in the event of some substantial change in the supply of water in the river, or something of that kind?"
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4044.922,4046.133,"Justice O'Connor, that--"
1982.8_orig,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4046.133,4054.459,Rather than to reopen it for issues which were litigated by the parties at the time of the original decree?
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4054.459,4089.33,"--Justice O'Connor, certainly such provisions do typically address the question of changed circumstances, and for that reason they are appropriate in order decrees where predictability is not always as certain as it might be, but it also authorizes here the correction we suggest of mistakes and omissions, at least if they can be shown to be of sufficient magnitude to justify the exercise of the Court's discretion."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4361.739,4389.827,"Mr. Claiborne, suppose the case, the issue is reopened, as you suggest it should be, and suppose that there is a later case that indicates rather clearly that the standard used by the Court and by the Special Master in this '64 decree has now been changed, or that it should no longer be applied."
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4397.183,4400.716,"--Justice White, I make two answers, or perhaps three."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4418.748,4426.622,Any stranger than inviting relitigation of the very issue that was litigated in the first place?
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4426.622,4429.174,"I think so, Justice White."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4429.174,4430.225,"Well, you must."
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4431.425,4446.996,I should have said parenthetically that I do not concede that there is presently from this Court any different standard with respect to the measurement of water properly allocated to Indian reservations.
1982.8_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4552.925,4560.361,I suppose we are equally free to construe the existing Article IX to prevent the sort of reopening which the government has tried to make here.
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4560.361,4564.643,"Justice Rehnquist, I cannot say the Court is not free."
1982.8_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4568.887,4572.7,Certainly not to strain the doctrine of law of the case.
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4572.7,4598.645,"If I may turn to the question of boundaries, I should say first that the boundary adjustments in this case would entitle the tribes with respect to the acreage which had been restored to their reservations to a total of about 127,000 acre feet of diversions from the--"
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4598.645,4600.756,Why do you call it restored?
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4620.02,4621.91,"--Mr. Justice White, no."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4629.434,4630.736,"Well, that isn't restoring."
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4630.736,4643.366,"Restoring in the factual sense that these areas had been deprived of reservation status in the interim, and now they have been restored to their reservation status--"
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4643.366,4651.04,"Well, how were they... how were they deprived of reservation status in the interim?"
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4651.04,4655.324,"--Most importantly, by being deprived of allocation of water."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4655.324,4664.837,"Well, had the Department of Interior treated these lands as being outside the reservation?"
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4664.837,4671.822,"The Department of the Interior had been ambiguous about the status of these boundary lands, and so Master Rifkind found."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4708.638,4713.37,"Well, if there was ambivalence, the latest position of the Interior Department doesn't remove it."
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4717.782,4720.085,"Justice White, no, the--"
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4720.085,4721.936,"Well, it is just the only... the latest step."
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4724.169,4733.063,"--The problem before was that there were solicitor's opinions looking one way, and there were other administrative actions looking the other way."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4767.326,4771.728,"Well, unless it changes its mind in the next Administration."
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4771.728,4779.904,"We have no reason to anticipate such a change, Justice White."
1982.8_orig,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4779.904,4786.317,"Mr. Claiborne, has it been finally resolved as to the Fort Mojave Reservation as well?"
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4786.317,4789.009,"It has, Justice O'Connor."
1982.8_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4849.68,4851.059,"Mr. Claiborne, can I just interrupt on this?"
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4858.746,4864.238,"Justice Stevens, I say at least they are presumptively correct."
1982.8_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4864.238,4865.889,But that doesn't win the case for you.
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4869.962,4879.409,"We don't have to, Justice Stevens, I think, take the position that they are not subject to challenge in the judicial proceeding elsewhere."
1982.8_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4879.409,4881.941,But they are not subject to challenge--
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4881.941,4896.701,"For the time being, they are presumptively correct and must be given effect for that because administrative decisions in the absence of a vacation by a court are entitled to--"
1982.8_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4896.701,4908.027,"--But in this proceeding, for the purposes of determining the respective water rights, are they not immune from challenge under the Master's decree, and your opponents were not given an opportunity to challenge?"
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4909.838,4923.508,"--We do say, Justice Stevens, that in this proceeding, in this Court, in light of the Court's own ruling in 1973, there is no occasion to review these decisions."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4929.952,4933.645,"Well, Mr. Claiborne, what is your... the United States' position in these other forums?"
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4948.354,4961.342,"Justice White, as was correctly stated, I think, by Mr. Boronkay, the United States has in the proceeding filed in the Southern District of California submitted a motion to dismiss alleging--"
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4961.342,4969.978,"So you are saying... your position is that these determinations are not subject to review anywhere, here or in another forum."
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4969.978,4979.805,--I hope I do not have to... I disown the motion to dismiss which has been filed by the United States in the district court.
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4987.609,4989.261,"Well, suppose they had prevailed."
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4992.391,4993.193,"--Yes, we would."
1982.8_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5010.164,5013.005,But the United States is in this Court litigating.
1982.8_orig,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5025.042,5025.983,--I appreciate that.
1982.8_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5317.606,5323.931,"Thank you, gentlemen."
