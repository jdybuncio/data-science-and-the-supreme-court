1959.391,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.13,"Number 391, George B. Parr et al., Petitioners, versus United States."
1959.391,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,11.351,17.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.391,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,271.616,272.976,Is that the District Court told the Court of Appeals?
1959.391,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,272.976,273.963,The Court of Appeals.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2543.723,2548.001,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.391,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2549.889,2552.35,Are you the Wilkey at the trial?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2552.35,2555.135,"Yes, indeed."
1959.391,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2555.135,2557.548,I -- I've been greatly puzzled.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2572.366,2573.283,Mr. Justice Douglas --
1959.391,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2573.283,2575.079,How -- how can that be explained?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2575.079,2596.142,"I intend to explain that fully and if you say that you were stirred to read that over and to find out that they did not exist, that is a mild statement as to how I felt when I found out that the grand jury statement in the court -- in the -- before the grand jury the mail fraud case did not exist."
1959.391,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2603.046,2604.079,Well you did -- you did.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2608.643,2625.512,"I stated three times that I had the grand jury transcript on Mr. Heras' testimony in my possession and -- in my office, not in the courtroom, and I meant the mail fraud grand jury and on the third time, I specified that it was the mail fraud grand jury."
1959.391,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2628.136,2630.515,Were -- were those at any time in existence?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2630.515,2632.176,"No, sir, never."
1959.391,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2632.176,2634.694,"Were they -- were they in -- in existence, but destroyed or --"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2634.694,2635.458,"Oh, no."
1959.391,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2638.491,2646.701,How do you happen to take the testimony of some witnesses not testimony of other witnesses before a grand jury?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2653.956,2664.448,"Let me assure you that the selective basis was not intentional in regard to not having a transcript of the witness, Heras', testimony."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2676.312,2680.623,"I don't want to delay it, but who conducted the grand jury?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2680.623,2684.268,"Mr. Bottler, my assistant, who is at the table here and I."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2684.268,2684.63,And you.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2687.784,2688.83,"Yes, I was."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2688.83,2691.342,During the entire evidence?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2691.342,2692.196,Before the grand jury?
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2692.196,2693.123,Yes.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2693.123,2693.434,No.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2702.528,2707.468,"Then who -- was -- was the stenographer, the regular court's stenographer or grand jury stenographer?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2707.468,2719.755,"The stenographer was one of the regular court stenographers, who was either habitually or occasionally employed before the courts here in the United States courthouse."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2730.61,2735.725,Why did he sit in the grand jury room with reference to your seat?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2735.725,2744.97,"I think, we generally put the court reporter right beside the witness where he could hear the witness' testimony clearly."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2752.154,2754.052,"Across the table, did you have a table?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2754.052,2754.629,Yes.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2755.429,2755.455,You have --
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2755.455,2756.238,Across the table.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2756.238,2761.459,"Like a grand jury room, usually as there was a table, the grand jurors were on both side of the table?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2761.459,2761.799,Yes.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2764.678,2768.225,Did you sit at the end or on the side of the --
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2768.225,2770.295,"I -- I forgot, sir."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2773.151,2776.032,But the other man sat right across from in the stenographer?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2776.032,2776.984,"The court reporter, yes."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2776.984,2777.671,Court reporter?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2777.671,2779.163,That is correct.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2931.424,2945.728,"Mr. Wilkey, I -- I don't want to disturb you but that fact that disturb me most frankly, is the fact that if all had occurred you knew you had these statements and that was the reason you did not have the reporter."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2962.648,2966.706,"You mean, I -- you -- you don't understand how I failed to recall?"
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2966.706,2968.394,"Yes, under those circumstances."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,2969.141,2979.418,"Mr. Justice Black, I, myself, have no independent recollection, of course, as to why I made the error in the courtroom."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3010.45,3024.143,Do you -- do you now remember definitely that you did not take it that much because you already had the statement or is that -- do you remember that definitely?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3024.143,3037.322,"I can't remember that definitely but by going back as to what happen in the circumstances, I'm satisfied that that is true and there -- that was the reason we did not record them."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3076.395,3078.866,I can -- I can understand that.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3091.717,3096.346,"He appeared before the grand jury on March the 6th, 1956."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3264.208,3272.619,Did the man have the kind reputation that has been asserted here if he had at that time?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3272.619,3276.167,Only in part and on a small part.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3287.252,3302.546,"Well, Mr. Wilkey, before you get to that, may I ask if the time that he appeared before the grand jury in this case, had he made those two conflicting affidavits one of which was admittedly false?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3302.546,3302.807,Yes.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3304.851,3305.156,Yes.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3305.156,3307.549,And that I want to mention that along with the others.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3307.549,3344.787,"Well, I was going to -- I was going to ask you this, if you had a -- have a witness that you're going to rely on at a trial and you find that that witness in the same proceeding or collateral proceedings has made two affidavits, so the facts one of which is admittedly false, is it not common prudence to -- to have his testimony at the grand jury recorded so you will -- you will have something, at least, for yourself to rely on, if you have to impeach him?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3344.787,3348.857,"Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, we did it once."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3350.607,3351.079,"Well, no."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3352.114,3352.923,Yes.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3352.923,3375.012,"Are this -- this you're indicting -- you're indicting some people in this proceeding and you are taking the testimony of an important witness and you know that in the same subject matter, he has made two affidavits, one which, he admits to be false."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3393.379,3403.124,"I certainly would, if his previous, erroneous or false statements had been concerned with the subject matter that we were inquiring about."
1959.391,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3553.503,3558.316,"What was the subject matter, Mr. Wikey, of the conflict -- and that you state?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3558.316,3566.757,The subject matter of the two statements which are exhibits -- defendant's Exhibit 213 and 214 and are printed on the record.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3676.595,3683.466,"What volume are those statements, does the (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3683.466,3684.804,Those two statements are --
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3684.804,3690.159,(Voice Overlap) get it.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3690.159,3693.042,"I had it here just a moment, Mr. (Inaudible) --"
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3693.042,3702.657,Maybe someone else could get it while you proceed.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3704.021,3706.751,"Well, they are in the record and I'll get first to you later."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3706.751,3707.132,Somewhat (Voice Overlap) --
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3707.132,3714.103,"Well, Mr. Wilkey, when he was on the stand then, he didn't stand on his second affidavit."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3720.983,3731.759,"Exactly, which he had told us and which we knew or believed to be true by facts not known to other people at the time for those affidavits."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3731.759,3734.865,Did he testify that way for a grand jury?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3734.865,3737.616,He was not asked about that I believe.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3776.633,3783.615,"So, he twice repudiated his testimony though, in his second affidavit, he repudiated the first affidavit --"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3783.615,3785.013,He -- he repudiated part of the first.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3785.013,3790.914,"-- and -- and on the -- on his testimony at the trial, he repudiated the second affidavit?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3790.914,3793.019,"He went back to the first, Mr. Justice."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3793.019,3794.962,"Well, isn't that t a repudiation?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3794.962,3795.716,"Yes, it is."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3795.716,3797.082,"Well, that's all I ask."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3797.082,3798.8,He said that was the truth of the matter.
1959.391,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3873.647,3874.911,Mr. Wilkey --
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3874.911,3874.971,Yes.
1959.391,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3874.971,3885.512,"-- can I ask you please, had both those statements been made before he testified before the grand jury in 1954, taking --"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3885.512,3887.616,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.391,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3897.219,3899.984,And you did testify before the grand jury in 1954?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3899.984,3900.601,That is correct.
1959.391,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3900.601,3904.402,And both the statements were maybe prior to that time and then exist as to that time?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3904.402,3905.831,That's right.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3914.423,3923.117,Why -- why was the grand jury not entitled of no -- connection with the charge against people?
1959.391,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3928.429,3928.593,And this --
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3928.593,3931.897,-- against that witness -- against that defendant.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3938.359,3939.233,"Well, it is relevant --"
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3939.233,3940.316,I don't believe it.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3940.316,3941.561,-- to his credibility.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3959.718,3961.431,"Well, was he an important witness?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,3970.354,3971.664,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4002.386,4003.926,How long did that take?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4003.926,4007.199,And that took less than a day.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4023.334,4025.326,"Well, he was a very important witness, I just (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4025.326,4025.984,He was one --
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4025.984,4030.425,I -- I -- I'm asking that question for this reason.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4042.282,4043.88,I certainly do.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4044.372,4049.234,Why was the grand jury not entitled to that evidence?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4049.234,4049.298,Well Mr. --
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4049.298,4055.498,And this man was this person that -- drawn personally against him?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4055.498,4059.472,I don't know that the grand jury was not entitled to it.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4062.21,4063.596,"Well, it was not relevant."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4076.284,4077.683,Absolutely.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4079.183,4094.751,"I don't mean to say by that innocent here, but I -- I mean introducing evidence that -- against a man from an important witness and that was known to be would -- would reflect on his credibility for this severeness."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4094.751,4105.515,We did not conceal anything about Heras' culpability in this -- that from the grand jury or from the trial jury either.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4106.395,4116.968,"(Voice Overlap) I just understood you -- I thought I understood you to say, you knew at the time you brought it before the grand jury that he had made these false statements against one of these defendants."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4121.546,4124.72,I could've put it in.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4221.305,4232.173,"Mr. Wilkey, at the time that he testified before the grand jury, did you have any understanding with him that if he did testify, he would not be prosecuted?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4232.173,4234.103,Absolutely not.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4234.285,4247.025,The -- then was there any explanation to the grand jury or any suggestion to the grand jury that he be not indicted?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4247.025,4260.289,"The indictment which we eventually drew and presented to the grand jury labelled Heras and the witness -- not a witness, she wasn't called as witness, before this trial, she may have been the jury."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4268.788,4274.383,"The grand jury declined to indict Heras, is that what you mean?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4274.383,4275.305,Yes.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4279.763,4280.233,Yes.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4282.472,4282.548,The only --
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4282.548,4292.021,-- did the grand jury know -- did the grand jury know that he had made these false affidavits before that?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4292.021,4293.049,These two --
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4293.049,4293.133,Yes.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4293.133,4293.712,-- their FBI statements?
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4293.712,4295.053,The two we've been talking about.

1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4296.162,4304.872,"Alright, now, when he testified in the grand jury, you say he testified the same as he testified in court."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4330.464,4356.521,"Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I can only say in reconstructing, while I think was my conduct there that I simply did not go into these two statements because they weren't relevant to any of the matters there being concerned."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4387.597,4392.799,Did you see any reason why he should not be indicted when the others were?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4392.799,4393.928,"Yes, for a good reason."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4393.928,4395.323,What -- what was the reason?

1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4499.662,4503.204,But you did name him in the indictment as one of the conspirators.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4503.204,4506.359,"That's right, for the period of time he was in the conspiracy."

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4519.263,4524.86,I don't -- I don't know how we would've done that.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4537.96,4551.476,"Well, I suppose you alleged that he was a conspirator between such and such dates, the same dates that you -- that you -- you alleged the defendants were in a conspiracy, did you not?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4551.476,4556.98,We alleged that the conspiracy existed from a certain date until February 1954.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4556.98,4558.302,Yes.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4559.681,4559.694,And we -- yes.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4559.694,4564.64,And we've alleged that various people were members of that conspiracy.

1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4638.073,4638.112,I -- I'm sorry.

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4640.086,4644.624,You asked me if I made any suggestion to the grand jury that they not indict Heras.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4644.624,4645.183,Yes.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4645.183,4652.582,"I said in answer to -- to that, that we prepared the indictment which named him a coconspirator, but did not name him as a defendant."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4664.754,4666.002,And they used him as a witness.

1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4670.09,4671.25,Alright.

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4706.832,4707.026,Yes.
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4756.889,4758.872,You mean in the privacy of your office you analyzed --
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4758.872,4759.568,"Yes, yes."
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4759.568,4772.298,"Did you then make some kind of analysis or summary of what the evidence -- what prosecutable offenses were made out by the evidence, what were not to the grand the jury?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4772.298,4775.305,"I have no recollection, sir."
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4779.379,4779.848,Yes.

1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4794.942,4809.574,"You happen to know what -- what was your practice, if you had a practice of having youre statements to the grand jury in summary or explanation of what the evidence disclosed or manifest, was that taken down by a stenographer?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4809.574,4812.31,"No, I don't recall it ever being done and --"
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4812.31,4822.399,Did Heras adjure the conspiracy or did -- or did you just not have enough -- have recent acts on his part?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4822.399,4834.848,"Well, in all frankness, I don't think that Heras have adjured the conspiracy.I think in July 1951, the conspirators adjured him."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4836.849,4838.548,And may -- they held that on him?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,4838.548,4842.532,They -- they cut him out of anything to do with it entirely.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5297.824,5311.953,Mr. Wilkey would you mind -- would you mind telling us what the distinction is between this case and the hypothetical case that Mr. --

1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5318.253,5319.415,I think it's important that we get --
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5319.415,5320.348,It -- it is.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5320.348,5321.529,-- to that for --
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5321.529,5325.823,On the -- on the mail fraud.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5400.654,5401.202,That's right.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5401.202,5401.411,Yes.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5401.411,5401.948,Yes.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5401.948,5404.808,"Now, we have not only that."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5439.325,5457.609,"Suppose -- suppose I -- I change his hypothetical case just a little and suppose there were two girls in that doctor's office and they said, “Well, we'll induce more people to -- to pay money into the cash by cash than by -- than by check."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5479.175,5480.209,"Yes, it would."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5480.209,5483.533,"Now -- now, would that be mail fraud?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5483.533,5493.25,"As I understand your example, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it -- if they -- it would be that the patient comes in the office and pays by cash."
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5500.811,5513.472,"Well, I -- I just changed his -- his case by saying that they induced people to put more money into the -- into the cash funds instead of paying it by check, it came through the mails."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5524.819,5525.513,I think I have your example now.

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5527.582,5530.84,You have posed the situation in which there is a fraudulent scheme.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5530.84,5531.132,That's right.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5531.132,5533.23,With no use of the mails to execute it.
1959.391,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5533.23,5533.287,Well --
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5533.287,5535.609,So there'll not be mail fraud.

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5535.826,5541.851,"Because the -- the money coming in, it brought in the checks and the mail is not (Voice Overlap) --"

1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5562.594,5599.667,"If you comingle -- if you comingle the two funds that the Chief Justice question's possible, you comingle the two funds namely, they get a lot of patients to leave their X dollar behind, but some patients they -- they bill and they get a -- an amplified fund and the funds go -- and the money that comes in through the -- through the checks in the mail, they have a full control of depositing the checks and getting them cashed on the bank."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,5599.667,5606.469,I -- I don't think that that has in it the elements of a mail fraud scheme.

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6007.083,6011.231,Because the bookkeeper is not in control of the store.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6012.068,6015.75,"Well -- well, suppose it was the manager of the store?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6015.75,6017.17,Well do you have a different case.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6017.17,6031.305,"In other words, the manager, who sends out the bill is perfectly ligitimate, and -- through the mail -- and stealing from his company, would be guilty of violating a mail fraud statute, in addition to theft and embezzlement."

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6084.127,6091.07,"The evidence shows uncontradicted, that in 1953, a whole string of taxpayers were left off the tax rolls."
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6092.563,6094.541,"Well, did they send them bill?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6094.541,6095.661,They certainly did.

1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6284.09,6284.617,What was the relation --
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6284.617,6285.534,-- the mail fraud statute.
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6285.534,6291.262,"What was the relation between the $700,000 part and the $400,000 that you've just mentioned?"

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6293.955,6310.817,"The evidence on budgetary figures showed that between Benavides and Freer, the revenues were split exactly equal and the budget in each case was almost exactly $200,000 for the two schools that made $400,000."
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6326.964,6330.566,"By tax revenue, you mean, the money they got in from sending out bills?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6330.566,6331.612,"Yes, plus --"
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6331.612,6339.474,"Well, you know why -- why was more money received in the $400,000 amounting to the budget of the two towns?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6339.474,6349.986,"We say, because the petitioners' plan and did appropriate it to their uses and that they were operating this public business for their own benefit."

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6363.781,6367.816,To provide the (Inaudible) for the conspirators to enjoy.
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6367.816,6375.708,"But then, it isn't a case of sending out compulsory legally required taxes?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6375.708,6380.815,"It isn't, Your Honor, because they have the option to put the rate anywhere they want it."
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6384.275,6397.198,"So that they meant -- they manipulated the tax system in order to have revenues out of which to spoon out or to -- to spoon out moneys for their own feeding, is that right?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6397.198,6397.957,Exactly and there's had to be --

1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6398.601,6398.805,"Now, where is that part?"

1959.391,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6401.338,6401.862,What's that?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6405.214,6405.859,Right.
1959.391,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6414.923,6429.243,"Are you telling us this that when they manipulated the tax bill, they immediately divided it without regard the requirements except to be sure that they got something above requirements in the way of tax receipts."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6435.476,6460.704,"Exactly, only if you'll look on Government Exhibit 1 on page 137 to 138, you'll see that your exact figures are that the tax rate was raised from $1.50 for the year ending August 1950 and on Government Exhibit -- well that's the rate in -- in August 1950 and on Government Exhibit 4 and about page 132, the tax rate is now $1.75 which was the legal maximum."

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6473.783,6473.927,Absolutely.
1959.391,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6473.927,6478.171,-- that they didn't raise it for the purpose of giving in the surplus which they could steal?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6478.171,6479.122,Absolutely.
1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6497.637,6504.127,"In other words, when Mr. Black and I get our tax bills, we get bills that are fixed by law."

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6668.772,6669.79,-- the money was appropriate.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6669.79,6675.494,"Quite a different thing from what you argued a while ago, the assessment goes up, the assessment goes up frequently."

1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6678.14,6680.894,Tax Assessor raises the assessment.
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6701.525,6703.298,There are two things said.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6706.314,6710.595,"Well, are you challenging the law of Texas as unconstitutional or the way they fix the taxes?"
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6710.595,6711.403,By an oath.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6732.162,6736.736,"What you're saying now, as I gather, and maybe that's the cost of this."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6749.928,6752.419,They set it -- we are -- we are not explaining.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6752.419,6754.941,Did they set it contrary to the law of Texas?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6754.941,6755.187,No.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6756.682,6761.711,Did they send out a single bill that was more than the law of Texas made legal?
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6761.711,6763.383,"No, because they were out of control of --"
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6763.383,6766.41,"Well, I'm not talking about who had control."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6785.798,6800.54,"Our -- we do not presume to say whether the tax rate should have been lower or the school budget should have been higher, because that would be at matter of judgment, if the judgment were harnessed."

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6825.993,6826.112,That's --
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6826.112,6829.558,-- collaterally attacking -- you're collaterally attacking the tax assessment.

1959.391,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6830.891,6851.631,"Or just saying -- are you saying that having power to fix a rate within a statutory limit, they fixed it not from the point of view of procuring taxes, to serve the public, they fixed it with a deliberate scheme to get money, go for chance within the legal limits in order to funnel it into their pocket."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6851.631,6853.168,"Absolutely, and that's our --"
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6853.168,6877.698,"When we get through, when you have time, would you send us references in the record, to the charges does it show us, so that we can see that the case was tried, indictment charged that case was tried on that basis, were submitted to the jury on the basis that you're charging them with fraud and that they assessed higher than they should have."
1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6877.698,6878.06,Fraudulent.
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6878.06,6880.17,And they get money for themselves.

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6887.728,6888.614,And --
1959.391,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6888.614,6891.009,Was any such thing submitted to the jury?

1959.391,1,36906,malcolm_richard_wilkey,,6922.428,6937.198,"We'll be glad to send you those references, but I want to say now that we didn't take in position here or at the trial that the rate had to be so and so or that the budget for the school had to be so and so."

1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7195.351,7196.874,"No, Your Honor."
1959.391,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7197.879,7200.965,May I rephrase what I understand to be the claim of the Government?
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7200.965,7201.625,"Yes, sir."
1959.391,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7201.625,7217.451,"Not that the rate was excessive or bloated, but it was so fixed at such a rate that money would be forthcoming out of which, they could take what they schemed from the beginning to take."
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7217.451,7219.639,I understand that to be in Mr. Wilkey's contention --

1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7220.103,7221.014,-- Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
1959.391,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7221.014,7222.401,-- for things that bloated.
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7222.401,7222.763,"Yes, sir."
1959.391,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7254.577,7277.557,"Would you regard -- and if there was such a scheme to do that, if there was a designed scheme to fix the rate, held be it, it might be a legal rate to fix a rate to the end, that the school purposes maybe satisfied thereby, but also some cream maybe skimmed off and then the mail was used."
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7284.392,7299.746,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, let me answer you this way, if the indictment alleged what you have just said and the evidence supported it and showed that the amount of money raised in each fiscal school year, was so clearly excessive and beyond --"
1959.391,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7299.746,7300.906,That was not my question.
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7300.906,7301.407,"Yes, sir."

1959.391,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7305.849,7306.805,Alright.
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7306.805,7307.203,"No, sir."

1959.391,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7421.401,7428.886,As the consequence of dividing the rateables into the requirements?
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7428.886,7433.223,Either the tax rate has to be adjusted or the valuations and usually ---

1959.391,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7435.471,7436.885,-- tax rate of $1.75.
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7436.885,7437.477,"Yes, sir."
1959.391,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7437.477,7452.758,"But assume you had rateables with requirements which dividing the latter by the former, would give you a tax rate of $1.25, well within the statutory -- the statutory limit, is that the way you arrive in a tax rate in Texas?"
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7452.758,7456.58,"In sometimes, but in exceptional cases arrived at that way."
1959.391,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7470.304,7479.789,"Well, this is -- this is because in order to raise as -- an amount this close as possible to the needs, you then apply the maximum tax rate?"

1959.391,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7498.996,7499.941,-- for that year.
1959.391,2,43365,t_gilbert_sharpe,,7518.789,7519.553,It could be.
1959.391,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7520.212,7521.203,"Now, in that -- in that circumstance --"
