1992.91-7328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.808,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-7328, Leonel Torres Herrera v. James A. Collins."
1992.91-7328,0,42621,talbot_dalemberte,,52.866,55.401,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1849.574,1858.514,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.972,2009.293,"You don't disagree with the proposition, I take it, that innocence is paramount?"
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2011.178,2016.297,Innocence is paramount to--
1992.91-7328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.297,2020.183,"Well, that's the proposition we're supposedly debating here."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2026.354,2029.539,--Certainly innocence is paramount.
1992.91-7328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.61,2046.668,"What's at issue here is whether that proposition shall become a provision of the Federal Constitution, meaning that Federal courts shall always have to sit in judgment of whether innocence has been adequately determined."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2049.12,2049.886,Right.
1992.91-7328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2071.866,2077.12,The defendant can bring later educed evidence before the governor of Texas?
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2077.12,2078.639,Definitely.
1992.91-7328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.639,2080.772,Has this been presented to him yet?
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2080.772,2088.928,My understanding upon an inquiry to the governor's office is that they have presented a request for a reprieve.
1992.91-7328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.889,2121.216,"If the Board of Pardons were to deny the request I assume it's because the Board of Pardons thinks that the individual is guilty, or not?"
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2128.822,2130.522,"Yes, they would be."
1992.91-7328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.522,2131.488,They would be?
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2131.488,2131.857,Yes.
1992.91-7328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.857,2133.19,Does that happen?
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2133.19,2135.392,That has not happened in my knowledge.
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.927,2143.379,"Of course the Texas Board of Pardons hasn't set aside a great many death sentences, has it?"
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2143.379,2144.947,"No, they haven't."
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.947,2147.366,It's not one of their favorite activities.
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2147.366,2162.309,"I think that that, and that is a criticism that of course has been levelled at the clemency process, is that it, you don't often see a death sentence being set aside."
1992.91-7328,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2182.622,2184.272,I know a few--
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2191.395,2192.278,No.
1992.91-7328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2242.095,2256.855,"That, the third way can be, it can be submitted to the clemency board or whatever simply on the basis of the request of the defendant and the defendant's counsel in a capital case?"
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2256.855,2257.738,That's correct.
1992.91-7328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2257.738,2258.89,I didn't understand.
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2262.074,2273.014,"What was done here was a request for the 30-day reprieve to allow them to develop additional evidence to, you know, to make a thorough request for clemency."
1992.91-7328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2278.684,2282.12,"I suppose, you know, you're ready for the tough questions."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2301.717,2306.187,"--No, Your Honor, there is not."
1992.91-7328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.889,2313.357,It would not be violative of the Constitution then to execute the person under those circumstances?
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2313.357,2317.745,"--No, it would not be violative of the Constitution under those circumstances."
1992.91-7328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2396.244,2400.565,And the governor is more accountable to the electorate than are the courts.
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2403.517,2411.254,"I would say in Texas, given the fact that we have an elected judiciary, that's a hard call."
1992.91-7328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2411.254,2413.29,I was thinking of the Federal courts.
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2413.29,2415.742,"Yes, definitely."
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.633,2438.755,"Ms. Griffey, your argument on this point is really much like the argument that the state made in the Ford case on executing a person who is not competent to know what's happening."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2438.755,2445.844,"It is, Your Honor, but there are several factors that distinguish the Ford case."
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.329,2477.131,Of course the same was true of Jackson against Virginia.
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2493.825,2497.127,"Well, of course Jackson v. Virginia is a due process case--"
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2497.127,2502.364,"But there was a minimum standard of evidence that was required, which was created in that case for the first time."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2502.364,2515.589,"--But it is the state's position that the due process rights that are derived from the due process clause are limited to the procedures that adhere to the process by which a defendant is brought to trial, tried, and sentenced."
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.589,2525.111,"Correct, but under the Eighth Amendment, as your opponent has stressed, we have had several procedural rules that are more stringent in the death context because the court has said death is different."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2536.418,2551.928,"Yes, I do, and I agree though that the heightened requirement of reliability in the capital context is designed to assure the reliability of the sentencing process."
1992.91-7328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.109,2581.697,Are you defending the decision below on the grounds that the court used?
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2581.697,2583.164,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1992.91-7328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.583,2595.291,"Well, the court said this evidence wouldn't, wouldn't be heard because it wasn't, didn't go to some constitutional, show some constitutional violation."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2596.257,2611.551,--That's my contention and my contention is that unlike Ford the Eighth Amendment does not dictate a constitutional violation in this case and that no constitutional violation can be derived under existing due process analysis.
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.269,2626.66,"Of course the very issue in the case is whether, if there is sufficiently persuasive evidence, and assume it's just everyone would agree that it establishes innocence, but his trial was fair, the jury just made a mistake."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2635.766,2637.534,"--That is what I'm saying, Your Honor."
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.534,2639.318,"But that is the issue, isn't it?"
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2647.14,2652.211,"I think that's the issue and I think that no, it would not."
1992.91-7328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.935,2669.672,The fact that a mistake was made and a man may be executed does not raise a constitutional issue?
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2687.634,2707.797,"--The way I understood the issue was that a death penalty couldn't be imposed upon someone who you had latter day evidence that raised an issue as to actual evidence, as to actual innocence, although perhaps you could impose a sentence of life without the possibility of parole upon that person."
1992.91-7328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.797,2709.247,How did the court of appeals go about it?
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2714.718,2724.157,They just said that there was no constitutional violation in this case and that newly discovered evidence relevant to guilt was not cognizable in the absence of a constitutional violation.
1992.91-7328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2816.167,2819.887,"Counsel, could you discuss Johnson v. Mississippi briefly?"
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2858.946,2868.201,"In that case the invalid conviction was being offered only to, relevant to the sentencing determination."
1992.91-7328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2876.657,2880.842,"Well, in a sense this case is an a fortiorari case then."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2888.865,2901.106,"Under that analysis, however, any error that accrued to the trial would become an Eighth Amendment error, and I don't think that that is the analysis that has been employed by this Court."
1992.91-7328,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2915.849,2920.669,"Well, we have said that the Eighth Amendment applies to the guilt determination phase."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2925.621,2926.657,Yes.
1992.91-7328,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2990.33,3004.323,"Ms. Griffey, you have made it clear, I think you have made it clear that it's irrelevant to your position whether or not there is any post trial procedure for recognizing newly discovered evidence and irrelevant whether or not there is any executive clemency."
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3021.619,3034.526,"It is clear that the state has no obligation as a constitutional matter, although they routinely do, to provide for direct appeal and state collateral review."
1992.91-7328,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3034.526,3035.294,Uh-huh.
1992.91-7328,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3054.006,3071.317,"I believe that the constitutional minimum, so to speak, would be that you could abolish Federal habeas and that the only avenue of relief to review the constitutionality of a conviction would be a direct appeal to this Court by writ of error."
1992.91-7328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.919,3076.705,"Thank you, Ms. Griffey."
1992.91-7328,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3079.321,3095.331,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.418,3240.639,"But there really aren't, the rule didn't apply to very many capital cases when it was adopted, did it?"
1992.91-7328,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3240.639,3250.661,"--It applied to cases such as murder, treason, it applied to such cases that you don't ordinarily see, but wrecking a train that results in death."
1992.91-7328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.065,3262.2,What's the last death sentence that the Federal Government has imposed?
1992.91-7328,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3262.2,3263.219,--Imposed?
1992.91-7328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.219,3263.735,Yeah.
1992.91-7328,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3263.735,3270.223,"Well, the last one that was imposed by a jury was imposed I believe either in 1991 or in 1990."
1992.91-7328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.542,3277.492,I used the wrong word.
1992.91-7328,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3279.91,3289.116,"--The last one carried out was in the 1960's, but there were death sentences carried out by the Federal Government after this rule went into effect in 1944."
1992.91-7328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3406.11,3408.31,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
