1985.85-568,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.356,We'll hear arguments next in Nantahala Power against the Utilities Commission.
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,11.808,14.85,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.495,162.936,"Where is Tapoco located, Mr. Lee?"
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,162.936,168.71,"A short distance over the North Carolina-Tennessee border, in eastern Tennessee."
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,168.71,170.202,How far from the border?
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,170.202,175.926,"I would say, Justice Rehnquist, on the order of 50, 60 miles, but I could be off by a few yards."
1985.85-568,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.988,308.193,"Well, Mr. Lee, what's the filed rate that the North Carolina Commission is bound by?"
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,308.193,319.339,"The filed rate in this instance was the New Fontana Agreement, supplemented by the 1971 allocation."
1985.85-568,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.621,322.101,The apportionment agreement?
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,322.101,326.044,The apportionment agreement was filed as a supplement to the NFA.
1985.85-568,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.044,334.372,"Well, how could the North Carolina Commission have followed the actual allocation of entitlements--"
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,334.372,335.521,When it hadn't been made?
1985.85-568,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.521,336.522,--Yes.
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,339.264,341.257,I appreciate the opportunity to clear that up.
1985.85-568,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.624,409.209,"So it's your view that North Carolina was bound by that apportionment agreement, even though FERC later changed?"
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,409.209,410.22,That is correct.
1985.85-568,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.238,473.372,"Well, what if Nantahala had gone out and purchased high cost power at a rate on file with FERC, which the North Carolina Utilities Commission subsequently decided Nantahala had imprudently and unnecessarily purchased?"
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,475.512,492.103,"It's different for this reason, that that simply is not the fact in this case, and there was no issue of whether this particular purchase or this particular arrangement, the NFA, in which it got low cost power, was or was not prudent--"
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,621.92,624.623,"Well, why is North Carolina bound by that?"
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,626.545,627.333,"Oh, indeed they were."
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.352,669.351,"Yes, I realize that."
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,683.37,697.77,We submit that the reason that it is the filed rate doctrine is that the NFA as supplemented by the apportionment agreement did make an apportionment of the entitlements.
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.52,747.063,But we're not bound by those state supreme court decisions.
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,747.063,748.445,"--That is correct, that is correct."
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.825,751.894,Why?
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,751.894,753.136,Because of the fact--
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,753.136,754.336,"Well, why on this particular point?"
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,758.28,763.183,"--Well, what Montana-Dakota stands for, of course, is that the filed rates are--"
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.183,769.736,That you can't relitigate in a federal district court the reasonableness of the FPC's ruling.
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,769.736,775.57,"--Yes, and you're right, Justice Rehnquist, this is an extension of the Montana-Dakota, of the Montana-Dakota principle."
1985.85-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.704,883.252,"Well, but I thought the issue you were answering me on was whether North Carolina can sort of pierce this corporate veil in some way, which wouldn't go to that general proposition you just mentioned at all, I would think."
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,883.252,892.057,"That is the question of the procedure that can be used, that is whether it can pierce the corporate veil, whether it can use this toll-in."
1985.85-568,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.677,981.514,"Well, it just, it seems to me that FERC didn't quite act by changing a filed rate or modifying the apportionment agreement."
1985.85-568,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,992.143,997.035,You might quarrel... a quarrel might be had with the language that FERC used.
1985.85-568,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1061.686,1072.966,Mr. Cohen.
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,1706.771,1712.444,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.85-568,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.782,1773.837,Did you put them before us in your motion to dismiss?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,1773.837,1775.737,We tried to.
1985.85-568,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.812,1785.705,You mean facts that aren't in the record?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,1785.705,1786.784,"--No, sir, they're in the record."
1985.85-568,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.987,1965.722,"When you speak of both states, what states are you referring to?"
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,1965.722,1967.152,North Carolina and Tennessee.
1985.85-568,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.873,2277.818,"Well, the Appellants of course say that this was all concluded in the proceedings before FERC, that it's too late for you now."
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2277.818,2284.362,"They're talking about a wholesale exchange arrangement, Senator... Senator."
1985.85-568,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.362,2287.193,Justice.
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2287.613,2292.906,Justice Rehnquist.
1985.85-568,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.863,2364.203,"But the position of the Appellants is that by the sort of rate structure and redefinition of rates that your Commission put on Nantahala and Tapoco, you have in effect disregarded the wholesale allocation."
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2364.203,2367.834,"Yes, I'm aware of that and I want to respond to that type of rationale right now."
1985.85-568,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2570.157,2581.525,"Mr. Crisp, do you agree that the Commission must apply the filed rate that FERC has on file for wholesale power--"
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2581.525,2583.998,Let me say this to you.
1985.85-568,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2583.998,2585.108,--in computing the retail?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2585.108,2589.251,We are in whole agreement with the Narragansett case.
1985.85-568,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2602.552,2605.561,"Well, what is the filed rate here in your view?"
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2605.561,2618.17,"Well, a filed rate, among other things, is a rate that has been filed and has been accepted, or at least permitted to go into effect, by the Commission until and if it's changed by the Commission."
1985.85-568,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2618.17,2626.305,"Well, is it your position that the agreements on file were not filed rates?"
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2626.305,2627.296,"Yes, ma'am."
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2804.172,2807.534,"Mr. Crisp, maybe you'd straighten me out."
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2814.58,2820.754,The two groups were Alcoa and the publics of North Carolina and Tennessee.
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.845,2824.708,They're not parties in this case.
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2824.708,2828.217,"No, they're not, not elsewhere... but the fight, and I did get off of this."
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2828.217,2831.78,"Well, what right do we have to pass upon them if they're not here?"
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2831.78,2833.002,"Well, you don't."
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.002,2834.362,Why aren't they here?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2834.362,2835.623,And that I'm saying to you is--
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.623,2836.675,Or are they here?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2836.675,2838.425,"--that they are here, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2860.892,2861.393,I thought you represented the state?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2861.393,2862.493,I beg your pardon?
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2862.493,2865.184,I thought you represented the state.
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2865.184,2869.318,"Mr. Thornburg, the Attorney General, is here and he represents the state of North Carolina."
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2873.461,2879.195,"Well, I read here Nantahala Power Company against the state of North Carolina."
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2879.195,2880.074,Et al.--
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2880.074,2880.725,That's a mistake?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2880.725,2881.616,--Et al.--
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2881.616,2882.898,That's a mistake?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2882.898,2883.966,"--No, that's not a mistake."
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2883.966,2884.948,The state is here?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2884.948,2885.338,That's correct.
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2885.338,2886.308,You represent the state?
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2886.308,2886.769,"No, sir."
1985.85-568,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2893.664,2894.205,I give up.
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,2894.205,2898.326,"Now, the battle that I alluded to, and I'm sorry I deviated from, was this."
1985.85-568,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3201.205,3204.677,"Well, if the Supreme Court of North Carolina considered their federal questions--"
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,3204.677,3206.358,"Yes, and I'm not saying, sir... I want to make that clear."
1985.85-568,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.6,3209.149,"--Well, why are you bringing this up?"
1985.85-568,1,44311,william_t_crisp,,3209.149,3211.43,"I'm bringing it up solely for this reason, sir."
1985.85-568,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3361.658,3368.253,"--Do you have anything further, Mr. Lee?"
1985.85-568,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3368.253,3369.284,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-568,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3369.284,3372.356,You have two minutes remaining.
1985.85-568,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3372.356,3385.314,"What the Appellees are asking this Court to do, and the only thing they're asking this Court to do, is to perform the function of deciding what is a fair and just allocation of these entitlements."
1985.85-568,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3513.608,3515.399,"Thank you, gentlemen."
