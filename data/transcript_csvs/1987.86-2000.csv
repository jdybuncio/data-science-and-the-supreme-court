1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,11.34,33.255,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case looks to the Thirteenth Amendment and its implementing legislation, principally Section 1584, Title XVIII of the U.S. Code, which makes it a crime for any person to knowingly and wilfully hold another to involuntary servitude."
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.226,223.313,"Mr. Reynolds, do you think the government could win at trial without a broad definition of this statute and without the use of psychological testimony?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,241.935,253.813,"--Justice O'Connor, I think that we certainly feel that we could prevail in this case without the psychological testimony."
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.225,276.77,"Well, one thing that is a concern, of course, is that these are criminal statutes."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,276.77,277.669,--Right.
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.669,317.185,"And presumably we have a rule of lenity, and the concern that one has in interpreting it broadly is, what do you do about services performed by someone because of the attraction of a loved one or the charisma of a spiritual or a political leader, or for example an adult child who may work for years taking care of an invalid parent out of fear that they will be cut off without an inheritance if they don't?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,323.46,329.306,"Well, that obviously is the difficulty that the lower courts wrestle with."
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.32,338.811,Do we know what servitude is?
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,338.811,361.066,"--I think that servitude is, as I understand the elements of that statute, it would include that a person is made to work for a defendant, to provide services for that defendant against his will, that that defendant has to specifically--"
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.066,365.45,"Well, the against the will component would seem to me to go to what is involuntary."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,367.674,376.53,--Servitude would be to perform services for the defendant who is exerting the coercion.
1987.86-2000,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,376.53,377.513,Any kind of services?
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,377.513,385.246,"Well, I think that it contemplates largely in the employment relationship."
1987.86-2000,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,385.246,387.858,Like shoveling manure.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,387.858,388.988,I am sorry?
1987.86-2000,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,388.988,390.53,Like shoveling manure.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,390.53,393.071,That would certainly be within the--
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.071,395.903,"Well, I used to have to do that as a youngster."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,399.466,417.349,"--Well, first the definition of servitude under the Thirteenth Amendment is one that has been traditionally recognized and was at the time to exclude certain relationships, such as the parent-child relationship."
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.273,486.578,"Well, what about the adult child who doesn't want to have to take care of an invalid parent but feels compelled to do so?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,486.578,498.715,"--Well, I think that again you have got to have... that would address the state of mind of the person who was providing the services."
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,517.298,529.096,But you would acknowledge there could be facts that would fit within it if the parent indeed was exerting some kind of psychological pressure on the offspring to make them do it.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,529.096,534.899,I think that there has to be... I am not sure psychological pressure alone would work.
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.346,580.58,"Mr. Reynolds, do you agree with the instruction that the District Court gave?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,580.58,590.057,I think that generally the instruction that the District Court gave on those elements are acceptable.
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.057,596.271,"So you don't think a new trial was necessary, that the Court of Appeals should have affirmed."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,596.271,614.184,"Well, there is another element of the case that went to the testimony of... psychological testimony that we did not bring to the Court that was thrown out by the court below, which is why you would have to have a new trial."
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.184,622.728,"Well, I thought they ordered a new trial because the District Court's definition was too broad."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,622.728,624.811,"Well, they did."
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.653,641.206,You think the Court of Appeals should have affirmed the conviction?
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,641.206,644.211,"That's right, I think it should have affirmed the conviction."
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,644.211,650.214,And hence the instruction is perfectly... was a proper one.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,650.214,650.994,Was a proper instruction.
1987.86-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.544,657.43,"Mr. Reynolds, let's get back to Justice O'Connor's question about the meaning of servitude for a moment."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,673.7,681.277,I would not think that that would be servitude for purposes--
1987.86-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,681.277,681.768,Why not?
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,681.768,696.05,"--Well, I don't think that that is what the statute contemplates as requiring that a specific service be provided by the individuals who are hazed."
1987.86-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,696.05,696.27,"Well, supposing you are--"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,696.27,701.004,That is a membership requirement to get into a fraternity.
1987.86-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.004,703.506,"--Yes, but that would be involuntary."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,709.282,728.185,"Well, I think that... oh, I see what you... I guess technically one could say that would be servitude, although I think if it is a hazing thing it is an aberrational... I mean, it is not to hold them in service to do work for a term which I think would have to be more than a--"
1987.86-2000,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,728.185,731.096,How could it be servitude when you pay for it?
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,736.801,741.024,--I guess the question went to before they got in.
1987.86-2000,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,742.133,745.236,You pay the dues when you apply to a fraternity.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,789.287,790.939,--I think it has to be more than unattractive.
1987.86-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.534,801.885,"Well, why not limit it to death or beating or some physical harm?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,816.17,842.335,"--I think, for example, that you could hypothesize a case involving hypnosis where somebody was hypnotized and told when they woke up they were going to have the kind of conditions of these two men here and perform whatever tasks they were asked to perform and would indeed be in servitude involuntarily by reason of hypnosis."
1987.86-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.209,877.11,"--What do you mean, so intolerable?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,892.763,898.786,"--Well, and that goes to one of the elements of the offense, which is the state of the mind of the victim."
1987.86-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.361,906.492,So that could qualify then.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,908.295,941.637,"--I think there are situations that could qualify, for example, where a religious... in a religious situation where the leader of the cult believed that beating of children or adults was the reflex response to ensure that they would indeed adhere to him and his edicts, that that could indeed get to the point of being, and kept them, kept people basically in that kind of condition--"
1987.86-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.637,944.258,What about depriving me of my father's love?
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,960.653,967.898,"--There again, I think that you are addressing only one feature of the element of the crime."
1987.86-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.831,1003.244,I think you are going to destroy a lot of family businesses in this country.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1003.244,1031.411,"Well, I think that the... again, I am not sure that that... I don't think that that does follow, because I think what that suggests is that the specific intent factor that is necessary in the criminal case, and the intent factor for the state of mind of the victim are a lot more casual than they are under this code."
1987.86-2000,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.411,1037.516,"Mr. Reynolds, shouldn't we leave a lot to the wisdom of the prosecutor?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1045.361,1048.064,Certainly the prosecutor--
1987.86-2000,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1048.064,1050.135,"They just wouldn't bring a case like that, would they?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1050.135,1052.408,"--I agree with you, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1987.86-2000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.958,1085.26,"Mr. Reynolds, can I interrupt you and go back a minute to your discussion of servitude?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1102.853,1104.934,I don't think so.
1987.86-2000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.862,1137.489,You think it would still be servitude if the terms of employment were perfectly normal and legitimate.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1144.852,1146.114,--I don't disagree.
1987.86-2000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.114,1147.894,Although I am not sure they have anything to do with voluntariness.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1147.894,1158.021,I don't disagree that it is stronger if you are not paying somebody and keeping them in the situation then there is certainly more reason to--
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.021,1168.129,"I suppose in terms of voluntariness, the worse the conditions are, the more likely it is that somebody would want to leave."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1178.796,1193.575,"--I think that that certainly is in the balance, and what you have to do is weigh that against what it is... what the pressures are on the other side that are being exerted by the defendant to compel them to stay."
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1221.826,1224.988,"Or threatened state-imposed legal coercion, I thought--"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1224.988,1225.385,That's right.
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.385,1227.398,--which may have been present here.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1227.398,1231.459,I think this has reference to--
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.459,1232.41,With mental institutions.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1232.41,1232.931,--the peonage situation--
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1232.931,1235.565,"Well, it didn't say that."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1235.565,1236.204,--Justice O'Connor.
1987.86-2000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.204,1238.287,It didn't say that.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1238.287,1246.542,"I think that is what the legal coercion would amount to, where somebody owes a debt and is being held to pay off the debt."
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.542,1257.18,"If you threaten someone with invoking the law to institutionalize them, that is certainly legal force, isn't it?"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1257.18,1265.856,"I think that if you... well, if you were... that is coercion."
1987.86-2000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1281.556,1294.977,"I take it, Mr. Reynolds, that you would not accept the same definition in this case as you would in a criminal case for the law of duress."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1313.106,1316.529,On the side of the victim?
1987.86-2000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1316.529,1317.079,Yes.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1317.079,1359.499,"Well, more... it is not very far from that, but it is... what we are arguing here is that it has to be... that the victim has no tolerable choice, that effectively choice has been removed to do anything but what he is being compelled to do, that on the... either that he has lacked... has a lack of capacity to make any choice, and that is one of the features that is at play in this case, given the mental retardation of these individuals--"
1987.86-2000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1359.499,1359.749,That is just a subjective component.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1365.235,1365.825,"--No, I don't think so."
1987.86-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.654,1415.369,But the jury always is going to have some sort of evidence from which they can deduce intent.
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1427.669,1430.012,--The definition of involuntary servitude?
1987.86-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.012,1443.41,"The definition of both servitude and involuntary, particularly if there is no reasonable man standard for Justice Scalia's hypothesis when the father wants the son to keep working."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1456.419,1459.822,"Well, I think that that is not unusual, though, in criminal law."
1987.86-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1485.227,1497.208,"But with kidnapping and other crimes you have objective factors that have to be present as well as the intent, and here there seems to be quite a dearth of objective factors."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1508.455,1511.429,You have to hold someone to involuntary servitude here.
1987.86-2000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.429,1524.025,"--Yes, but what you are talking about in a typical kidnapping statute is a physical restraint, and here obviously your definition embraces something a good deal more than a physical restraint."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1524.025,1531.321,"Well, in the kidnappping statute you have to hold them against their will."
1987.86-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.265,1564.098,"What differs in all of those cast, though, is what I suggested earlier."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1589.906,1593.807,But that then is a failure of all of the Courts of Appeals decisions.
1987.86-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1597.06,1598.632,"Well, that is right, but--"
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1598.632,1604.075,"I mean, the fact is that if you are to... if you reach that conclusion that proves too much."
1987.86-2000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.146,1629.641,"--All it proves is that the test can't be whether the person really wills it or not, that your focus on the voluntariness is a focus on something which never exists."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1646.797,1696.489,"I guess at one level one could say that, although taking this case, where you have two individuals who view the world in the same eyes as children of age seven to ten, and who are convinced as to no choice but to do that which the authoritative figure instructs them to do, add to that all of the other indicia of coercion that are in this case, and it seems to me that it is easy to conclude that here these individuals believed that they had no other choice than to stay in the circumstances they were in, and that that was what kept them there, notwithstanding the kind of living conditions that Justice White mentioned."

1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1713.85,1718.545,"Well, I think that that is a distinction, though, that is important."
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.411,1753.831,"Well, the defendant says, I want you to do this job, and I will pay you a certain amount of money, and I want to keep you here, and I am sure that if you quit you will never get another job."
1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1758.733,1775.313,"I think that in some respects that is the factual backdrop in this case, where this defendant led these two people to believe that if they did not stay here that there was nothing out there, no job, no home."
1987.86-2000,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.214,1779.647,"So in my example, yes, it might be... you might be able to make a prima facie case."

1987.86-2000,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1836.684,1840.876,"--Well, that is close."

1987.86-2000,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,2695.529,2696.62,Where the--
1987.86-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.62,2702.084,"Yes, but what about... does your definition that you are plugging for cover that?"
1987.86-2000,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,2702.084,2702.505,"--Oh, yes."
1987.86-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.267,2707.528,That is legal coercion.
1987.86-2000,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,2707.528,2707.998,Yes.
1987.86-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.998,2713.282,You threaten to get him enmeshed in the... of the state.

1987.86-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.127,2725.889,So the threat of putting them in a mental institution is the same sort of thing.
1987.86-2000,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,2725.889,2727.511,"I would think so, yes."
1987.86-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2727.511,2737.318,"Would the threat to sue him for a debt be that sort of coercion, or does legal coercion have to include the possibility of imprisonment or confinement?"

1987.86-2000,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,2757.323,2759.736,That is--

1987.86-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.191,2781.444,"Now, you either stay here or I am going to turn him in."
