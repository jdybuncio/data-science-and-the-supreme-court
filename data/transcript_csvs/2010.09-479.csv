2010.09-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.808,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-479, Abbott v. United States and the consolidated case, 7073, Gould v. United States."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,13.824,17.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-479,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,89.122,99.81,"Well, if the text of this is so clear, how is it that Mr. Gould and Mr. Abbott proposed different interpretations of this provision?"
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,99.81,104.762,"Your Honor, as a judicial matter, I would note that I think our interpretations are not that far apart."
2010.09-479,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,104.762,106.797,"But they are not the same, are they?"
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,106.797,107.314,They are not.
2010.09-479,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,115.784,122.824,Isn't it -- there is a missing prepositional phrase in this -- in the provision that we are looking at.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,155.711,164.317,"--Your Honor, respectfully, I believe under our interpretation, it -- there is -- you do have to understand something to be in there, but we are not actually reading anything into the text."
2010.09-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.599,210.244,"So that means there would be no punishment, added punishment, at all for the possession of the gun; that is, you have the possession with intent to distribute, no gun involved, and you get ten years mandatory minimum for that."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,215.712,217.564,Yes.
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,235.126,235.743,I'm sorry.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,253.487,256.439,"--That is the -- yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,257.522,263.426,"So you -- you said to Justice Alito that you weren't reading anything in, but you are."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,275.083,276.166,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,276.166,276.783,All right.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,288.407,291.359,"Your Honor, two things--"
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,291.359,292.393,"Which is, I think, Justice Ginsburg's."
2010.09-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.393,293.295,Yes.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,295.645,302.483,"--If I may, and I think it will help in answering your question, Justice Sotomayor, that is correct."
2010.09-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,324.83,325.23,But that is not mandatory?
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,325.23,327.682,--That is no longer mandatory.
2010.09-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.133,347.993,"So you are saying that the gun possession could be accounted for by the judge as a matter of discretion using guidelines, but there is no mandatory at all?"
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,347.993,349.927,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.514,367.12,And I suppose the prosecution can alter the consequence based on what it chooses to bring in a single prosecution.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,393.087,397.241,"Justice Scalia, I think that's correct to an extent."
2010.09-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.997,434.53,Yes.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,436.049,436.566,--Okay.
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,458.579,472.487,"Explain how, because you just said to Justice Scalia that if the mandatory minimum is in a separate charging instrument, then it doesn't affect you at all."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,478.289,479.474,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,480.024,485.628,So what in the language of 924(c) sets forth that limitation?
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,485.628,493.316,"Your Honor, I would say that it is the words ""is otherwise provided"" and the context in which any textual reading--"
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,493.316,499.387,"Well, their ""otherwise provided by law"" could be Federal, State laws."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,509.843,518.866,"--Your Honor, it is -- first of all, the statute begins by directing the defendant -- I mean, directing the district court to any person."
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,534.375,535.894,In relationship to what?
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,554.871,567.346,"--Your Honor, because that -- because the statute as a whole is essentially instructions to the district court on how to sentence the defendant, if at all, for the 924(c)(1)(A) offense."
2010.09-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,598.3,607.49,Don't most crimes of violence and drug trafficking carry more than a five-year sentence?
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,607.49,610.108,"Many of them do, Your Honor."
2010.09-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.569,637.759,So let's suppose somebody commits a rape and a maiming in the same criminal act.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,681.471,682.771,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.771,683.923,That seems--
2010.09-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.923,685.023,I'm not sure that that's right.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,717.094,719.079,Yes.
2010.09-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.079,719.913,Have you looked into that?
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,733.57,745.462,"In answering your question, Justice Breyer, and in answering Justice Scalia's question, my assumption was that there were, in fact, mandatory minimums such that this would play out with one being greater than the other."
2010.09-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.462,747.829,--He's disagreeing with you.
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,761.723,762.706,"No, that's correct."
2010.09-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.706,763.789,"Well, read it that way."
2010.09-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,765.541,773.545,"If that's so, then this gives tremendous power to the prosecutor to decide what the sentence will be in terms of how he manipulates the charge."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,784.253,795.226,"Your Honor, there will be circumstances in which the prosecutor for the Government, based on how it makes its charging decisions, can affect the floor that's created by the minimum sentence."
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,819.323,829.362,"Justice Breyer is reading a bit what your co-counsel is advocating, what Mr. Abbott is arguing?"
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,829.362,830.38,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-479,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,831.33,831.83,No?
2010.09-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.83,832.999,"I mean, I don't know if it makes any difference."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,842.188,853.127,"--No, I'm not aware of that, Your Honor, in part because the except clause is -- there aren't that many instances of the except clause having been actually applied."
2010.09-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.127,857.031,"--There has never been any incentive to do so, until we accept your interpretation."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,859.631,871.707,"There may be -- Justice Scalia, there may be some incentive do so, subject to other constraints, including the -- the usual practice of charging, for instance, most offenses as they come under the transaction in the same indictment."
2010.09-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.188,921.871,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-479,0,21032,david_l_horan,,921.871,924.137,Thank you.
2010.09-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,924.137,932.993,Mr. Ryan.
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,932.993,935.362,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-479,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,981.825,998.102,930(c): A person who kills any person in the course of bringing a firearm into a Federal facility shall be punished as provided in sections setting forth minimums for murder and manslaughter.
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1000.852,1004.22,"It's not clear from the Government's argument, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-479,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.22,1006.137,"I wasn't sure why it didn't list 930, but--"
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1006.137,1017.409,"As I understand the Government's argument, the sentence that -- the only sentence that would count outside of 924(c) would be a sentence specifically for a 924(c)(1)(A) offense--"
2010.09-479,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1017.409,1020.628,"--I know, but its brief does two formulations."
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1021.794,1023.128,--Exactly right.
2010.09-479,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1023.128,1028.465,--anything that affects 924(c); and then in other places in its brief it says the --
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1046.509,1047.445,"That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-479,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1048.195,1050.397,I am focusing on the second formulation.
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1050.397,1051.147,--Okay.
2010.09-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1224.906,1229.56,Where would we look to find the definition of a criminal transaction for these purposes?
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1229.56,1232.177,You could look into 924(c) itself.
2010.09-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1243.716,1251.655,What if there were several 924(c) offenses committed during a rather brief period of time?
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1265.481,1266.697,No.
2010.09-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1277.705,1282.091,"Well, you say different transactions, but I'm looking for the definition of a criminal transaction."
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1289.427,1299.949,"No, it's not, but -- Your Honor, but I don't see how it would be any more difficult to determine the transaction than to look at what would constitute the 924(c) offense."
2010.09-479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1306.871,1317.846,"Mr. Ryan, I thought that you had three positions and now you are talking about the second one, which is any greater minimum sentence arising from the same criminal episode."
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1325.35,1327.368,That is Mr. Gould's position.
2010.09-479,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1334.789,1335.908,--charging--
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1335.908,1343.895,"--Well, the way it would have to work is that there would have to be a previous conviction."
2010.09-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1353.583,1354.95,"Excuse me, before you go on."
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1369.36,1371.193,--I misspoke.
2010.09-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1458.668,1460.268,"Well, it gives broader effect."
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1466.572,1467.524,It gives no--
2010.09-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1467.524,1476.812,--3359(c) which was enacted at the same time as the 924(c).
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1476.812,1478.914,"--Two points, Justice Alito."
2010.09-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1502.53,1503.163,Yes.
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1503.163,1507.249,--it was at that point that the except clause also entered into 924(c).
2010.09-479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1606.514,1619.838,"But you have offered three different readings, so one can't say that this statutory text has a clear meaning, which I think is your first argument -- that it has a clear meaning."
2010.09-479,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1629.011,1630.777,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.946,1659.946,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1664.684,1667.469,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1669.202,1696.469,"Counsel, could I just ask one simple question, the one I started with earlier, which was, which of the two statements are you advocating, that the 924(c) explicitly, or are you saying the ""except"" clause -- and I'm quoting from your brief, in two different places --"
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1709.879,1712.165,--I don't think there needs to be an explicit reference.
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1724.056,1724.773,All right.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1749.138,1749.938,He is incorrect.
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1749.938,1751.004,Okay.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1751.004,1759.594,"First, with respect to the internal structure of 924(c), 924(c) as it was amended in 1998 is a somewhat complex statute."
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1797.752,1798.821,I'm sorry.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1815.58,1817.246,--He gets 20 years.
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1817.246,1818.146,How?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1818.146,1834.725,Because the 924(c) offense.
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1841.445,1847.349,"So if it's a machine gun where there is a 30-year minimum, does he get 40 or 30?"
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1847.349,1848.051,He gets 30.
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.692,1864.542,But that's not -- I can't imagine a single district judge getting that wrong.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1883.855,1894.579,"--That point, Mr. Chief Justice, applies in support of our position, because everyone agrees that the primary function, the first half of the ""except"" clause, does exactly that."
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.618,1906.304,But that would include (b).
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1908.137,1910.422,--Yes.
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.422,1934.537,"So, you know, I think what the Chief Justice says is very obvious when you are just talking about C(1)(a), but it isn't obvious to me that if -- if the firearm is discharged and in addition it's a machine gun or destructive device, that you'd only get the 30 rather than the 30 plus 10."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1934.537,1935.387,Quite so.
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.387,1937.239,That isn't obvious to me.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1940.541,1941.157,Correct.
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1942.357,1945.845,"Well, I guess things are obvious to different people."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1952.415,1968.525,"--I agree with that, but it's important to realize that another issue that a district court judge might confront is whether you should cumulate them so it should be, as Justice Sotomayor's question suggests, that if there are several available that you get 20 because it's a machine gun and 10 because it was discharged."
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2024.178,2029.165,"But your main -- the meat of your argument focuses on 3559(c), right?"
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2048.644,2059.368,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think the effect of the ""except"" clause is the opposite, which is it makes sure that a judge imposes only life and does not add additional sentences."
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2059.368,2060.618,"Yes, exactly."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2061.553,2063.57,"And I agree, from the perspective of a defendant, that may not be most consequential."
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2073.778,2074.311,Okay.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2097.659,2104.73,"--I agree, it's not practically significant to a defendant, although sentences of life plus additional terms or consecutive life are not at all uncommon in the code."
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2110.501,2111.501,What do you do with 930(c)?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2114.369,2115.469,--Yes.
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2128.213,2141.853,"But your answer to me was, you read the ""except"" clause as applying to any higher minimum sentence for possessing, using or carrying a firearm in relationship to a drug offense or crime of violence."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2144.222,2145.605,--Yes.
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2147.174,2151.476,And isn't bringing of a firearm into a Federal facility the carrying of a firearm?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2151.476,2152.059,--Yes.
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.761,2156.428,Where is 930(c)?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2157.38,2164.3,--I don't believe -- it is referred to only in Petitioner Abbott's brief at a page number I don't recall.
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2165.65,2177.857,"No, but I'm still trying to understand your position, which is -- I read what you said to me the 930(c) and I couldn't figure out why you didn't list it."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2177.857,2183.428,--Because 930(c) does not require an actual killing of a person.
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2190.434,2190.951,How?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2190.951,2192.317,By conspiring or--
2010.09-479,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2192.317,2194.303,A person who kills any person--
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2194.303,2195.619,--Or by attempting to do so.
2010.09-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.111,2224.822,"So there are two possible readings now of the ""except"" clause where it says -- the words are the subsection doesn't apply where a mandatory -- where any other provision of law sets forth a higher mandatory."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2327.39,2336.911,"--Well, I think when you place this in the context of the 1998 amendments that enacted the ""except"" clause, it is quite clear that the former is more plausible."
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2425.114,2435.239,"--Wait, but it -- but it does -- it does subject them to less, at least with respect to those -- those enhancements set forth within the subsection itself."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2435.239,2436.222,--That is true.
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.393,2441.76,Why?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2441.76,2452.534,"--Because none of -- in prior 924(c) law, there wasn't a body of law that would have given anybody who would get the benefit of the 924(c) a higher sentence."
2010.09-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.697,2480.767,When -- when did Congress pass the statute that they amended in 1998?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2489.707,2495.111,"Well, section 924(c) in its original form I think was passed in the 1960s."
2010.09-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.111,2497.329,So that's way before the guidelines.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2534.835,2555.13,"On the general approach of Congress under 924(c), it also bears note that in the last 25 years Congress has amended section 924(c) six times, and setting aside for a moment the ""except"" clause, in all of those amendments Congress has uniformly expanded its scope or increased the severity of sentences."
2010.09-479,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2568.556,2577.578,"How do you answer Mr. Ryan's argument that you can read it this way, you can read it that way; therefore, he wins under the rule of lenity?"
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2577.578,2588.6,"Well, this Court's cases make it clear that the rule of lenity comes into play at the end of the analysis only if there is grievous ambiguity after all the considerations of statutory construction have been considered."
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2623.873,2635.915,"But that's a difficult -- you are saying because Congress wanted to get tough on the people that use firearms in this provision, every ambiguous clause should be read in a way that makes it tougher on the criminal defendant?"
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2635.915,2638.45,--I don't -- that would push the argument too far.
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2684.013,2689.065,"With respect to 3559(c) they were in fact being more lenient, not stricter, right?"
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2689.065,2690.667,"--No, I think they were clarifying--"
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2690.667,2697.988,"I thought you said earlier the purpose of this, what it does, is it makes sure that you don't add five extra years on the people who are sentenced to life."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2697.988,2706.861,"--I think it clarifies the relationship, and in fact arguably it could have clarified the situation in a way that would have been beneficial to defendants."
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2740.517,2746.838,"Which is just saying when you get life, or you get 5, just serve life, don't serve the extra 5."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2746.838,2747.354,--Yes.
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.859,2760.411,"That's the only thing that that additional language which says,"
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2767.001,2767.701,--Well--
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.701,2774.655,"That's the only thing it covers, that tiny little thing which has no effect at all, except for the benefit of the busy district judges, you say."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2776.273,2783.844,"--Well, remember that it was -- although it is not hugely consequent actual to defendants, it was a provision that Congress was directly considering then."
2010.09-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.648,2817.631,It's not strongly.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2845.249,2858.408,"Well, I -- there are -- there are other provisions that, like 924(j), which do provide sentences for 924(c) offenses that are codified elsewhere in the code."
2010.09-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.045,2872.735,"I take it in those other sentences there are other thing in the code, and the odd thing about this one is there no other thing in the code except the one we have been discussing."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2882.007,2886.726,--I'm not aware that -- that Congress had some particular pending legislation in mind.
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2938.427,2946.264,Is there any evidence in the legislative history that the reason they put this in was to ensure that people who got life would not get life plus five years?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2946.264,2949.133,--There is no explicit reference to that.
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.12,2983.87,One witness at a hearing?
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2990.29,2991.226,--I don't.
2010.09-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3016.191,3016.957,"No, no, no."
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,3038.487,3038.737,--Two responses.
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.66,3075.41,"Well, wait."
2010.09-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3081.48,3083.516,I did.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,3083.516,3086.801,"--They could not have been, even in the pre-Booker world."
2010.09-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.884,3090.253,Advisory.
2010.09-479,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,3090.253,3099.375,"But the point is that Congress -- if Congress was shifting in the except clause, the question is, what is the nature of that policy shift?"
2010.09-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.336,3124.823,You should pick any other violent or drug trafficking offense that already provides a higher minimum.
2010.09-479,3,32697,james_e_ryan,,3124.823,3126.29,That--
2010.09-479,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3126.29,3140.832,"No, it seems to me the perfectly natural reading to say: Look, we are providing some minimum sentences when this happens, when this is the violent crime and you use a gun, but if you have already got a higher sentence for the violent crime, then this doesn't apply."
2010.09-479,4,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,3140.832,3146.07,"That is a possible policy, to be sure, but one thing: It's certainly not the only reasonable policy."
2010.09-479,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.816,3197.349,Excuse me.
2010.09-479,4,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,3211.309,3212.259,--No--
2010.09-479,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.259,3223.866,"--You are saying that the other side has to say: Well, it's only those that are in this particular criminal transaction, or only those in the particular indictment."
2010.09-479,4,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,3225.402,3236.341,"--I think we do, and the reason we do is because, in our view, this provision operates only when you are talking about prosecution for the same offense in double jeopardy purposes."
2010.09-479,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3264.777,3266.477,--So how is your reading different from Mr. Abbott's?
2010.09-479,4,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,3266.477,3276.435,"--Mr. Abbott has two readings, and our reading differs from each of them."
2010.09-479,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3369.277,3376.696,"As Justice Breyer has pointed out, he can take that into account in figuring out what sentence he would want to impose beyond the greater minimum."
2010.09-479,4,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,3376.696,3378.465,That is true.
2010.09-479,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3425.779,3426.696,"Thank you, Mr. McLeese."
2010.09-479,5,32697,james_e_ryan,,3429.815,3435.385,I would like to make two points on rebuttal.
2010.09-479,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3502.242,3503.775,"Whenever Congress uses a phrase like that,"
2010.09-479,5,32697,james_e_ryan,,3510.562,3514.364,"Possibly, yes."
2010.09-479,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3519.149,3530.171,"Doesn't Congress commonly do that to make sure that something covers any existing statute there might be that would fall within that, without necessarily saying: Well, there are two of them -- if there are two, maybe there are three?"
2010.09-479,5,32697,james_e_ryan,,3534.841,3538.543,"--Yes, Justice Alito, and that is consistent with my point, is that--"
2010.09-479,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3538.543,3543.097,"It is not consistent with your main argument about the except clause, is it?"
2010.09-479,5,32697,james_e_ryan,,3543.097,3548.834,"--Well, yes, it is, because the except clause would also apply to any other provision of law."
2010.09-479,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3548.834,3557.607,"No, but your argument is the except clause has to have some pretty substantial effect, or otherwise, the ""any other provision of law"" part of it -- otherwise, they wouldn't have put it in."
2010.09-479,5,32697,james_e_ryan,,3557.607,3558.424,"Oh, I apologize."
2010.09-479,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3610.623,3611.723,"Thank you, Counsel."
