2012.11-1518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.237,"We'll hear argument next in case 11-1518, Bullock versus Bank Champaign."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,6.937,9.872,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1518,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,75.748,85.437,"Well, before we get to the various candidates for applicable mental state, if there is one, could you tell me what this mental state applies to?"
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,88.891,98.347,"Your Honor, it should apply to both, but it applies -- the act must be accompanied by a culpable mental state."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,118.41,138.655,"Well, what we have here is, I think everybody agrees, that these transactions were not authorized and they were self-dealing to the extent that there was a benefit to Mr. Bullock from the investments that were made."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,156.366,172.745,"Your Honor, we believe that a showing of extreme recklessness at least is required as to the self-dealing, and so we have advocated for the First and Second Circuit standard, which requires either extreme recklessness or conscious misbehavior by the actor."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,172.745,191.875,But is a trustee who is taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life insurance making an investment for the benefit of himself and his mother getting profit from that investment and not sharing it with the other siblings who are also.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,197.443,202.581,"Well, Your Honor, let me go back to the question, first were -- were the loans authorized."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.903,266.438,But what about the two other transactions which were not done at the bidding of the father?
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,266.438,272.526,"Well, Your Honor, they were done at the bidding of the mother and also they were -- they went into the family business."
2012.11-1518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,287.851,306.846,"Well, I mean, it's often the case that -- that children don't want to go into the family business and it's often the case that some of them do and some of them don't and the idea that one of the children who wants to put the money back in the family business is -- you know, you wouldn't think that was wrong when the other children want to take the money out or put it somewhere else."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,307.979,311.947,"Well, it's not unusual to have some sort of conflict about that, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,319.368,322.07,Their preference is that they wanted a piece of the action.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,330.425,338.331,"--That -- that position seems clear now, Your Honor, that -- that background, these loans were made, please, recall, in the '80s."
2012.11-1518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.331,344.835,"I -- I assume the other children did not have an interest in the business, but just the trustee and the mother did."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,346.604,348.17,"That is not clear from the record, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,352.038,355.156,"Could -- could you go back, please, to Justice Alito's question?"
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,449.448,451.065,"--Your Honor, let me -- let me try."
2012.11-1518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.625,487.59,"But I didn't think there's any respect here in which missing, mistake of law, would negate the mental state as to having taken money from the trust, used it in the family business and then paid it back, which I take it are -- we assume, which is a different question I have -- but for present purposes, we are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,496.696,504.55,"Well, Your Honor, the knowledge of the law, knowledge of wrongdoing I think is what -- what you're asking, where does that come into this?"
2012.11-1518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,517.192,518.76,"No, it had nothing to do with recklessness."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,528.148,531.433,"--Well, Your Honor, but he did it without knowing that they--"
2012.11-1518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,531.433,532.433,Were unlawful.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,538.187,550.061,"--Well, Your Honor, in many instances -- not many -- but in some instances, the Court has held that not knowing that a practice is unlawful is a defense to a charge of the crime."
2012.11-1518,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,550.061,562.135,"--My problem is the following, which is let's assume he had taken the money and lost it and he never repaid it."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,608.683,626.145,"Well, Your Honor, the question would be whether or not on the mental state -- and then I'll get to the actus reus element of this quickly -- but as to the mental state, if the mental state is not culpable then it seems entirely inconsistent--"
2012.11-1518,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,626.145,633.564,"Well, that's Justice Breyer's point, which is if you took the money and lost it, what does it matter?"
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,664.87,668.822,"--Well, Your Honor, of course, it does not save you from liability."
2012.11-1518,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,671.357,683.997,"Why should you be discharged if you took -- if you knowingly did an act, the actus reus, with its concomitant mental state."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,685.183,701.809,"--Well, Your Honor, because for dischargeability purposes, because of Gleason v. Thaw, and the rule that -- that bankruptcy discharge exceptions are confined to those plainly expressed doubts, are resolved in favor of the debtor."
2012.11-1518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,717.82,729.295,"Yes, but you see -- should I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have to deal with this issue, and I'd have to say something about it."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,771.222,783.947,"--Well, Your Honor, you're alluding to Cheek v. United States and Rasco v. United States, cases in which ignorance of the law as an exception to the general rule was found to be a defense in those cases."
2012.11-1518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.728,810.097,I have one other question on a different subject that may be more helpful to you or not.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,847.289,848.039,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,859.18,862.565,But there is a shortage of accounts at the end of the day.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,882.878,907.928,"Well, Your Honor, the deletion of the word “ misappropriation ” in 1978 from the Bankruptcy Code by Congress suggests that misappropriations that -- that are on an interim basis that cause -- that do not cause a loss to the trust and are -- are never accounted for is not the kind of action or act that should result in an exception to discharge."
2012.11-1518,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,981.726,984.078,But I guess the question is how do you measure this loss?
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1012.861,1015.48,"Correct, Justice Kagan."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1034.274,1038.409,"But what -- what about the profit from the transactions, the profit that he made?"
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1052.069,1057.807,"--He was -- he was charged with having profited with respect to one or more of the loans, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.807,1060.075,A quarter of a million dollars in loans.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1060.075,1061.792,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.792,1063.711,And that did not go back into the trust.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1063.711,1064.627,It did not.
2012.11-1518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.627,1065.563,As it should.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1073.317,1076.951,"He -- he does for liability purposes, of course, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.472,1097.198,"May I ask you question that is not a technical bankruptcy question, but he -- the objective of filing for bankruptcy was to get rid of this judgment debt, this Illinois judgment debt, right?"
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1097.198,1097.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.698,1107.487,"And the Eleventh Circuit said, you know, we're really sympathetic to that, but the problem is that the bank would not let you sell the collateral."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1130.419,1133.371,"That -- that action has not been brought, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1155.8,1161.454,"Counsel, give me your best answer to the rule that we should write, okay?"
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1229.281,1230.631,--Your Honor--
2012.11-1518,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.631,1241.755,"Because there is a difference between what the trust loses and the gain that the trustee makes, which under normal trust principles the gain has to be disgorged."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1255.932,1262.253,"--Your Honor, the -- the loss to the trust should be measured by the economic loss to the trust between points A and point B."
2012.11-1518,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1275.01,1278.612,"So under your theory, the profit to the trustee is never a measurement."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1278.612,1280.98,--The profit to the trustee would not come into play.
2012.11-1518,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1289.586,1304.263,"Assume that that is distasteful, because for all the reasons the Government argues in its amicus brief, the idea that a trustee could self-deal is the height of a breach of fiduciary duty."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1325.276,1330.413,"Well, for the -- for that worst case, Your Honor, there is embezzlement in the statute."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1345.24,1352.243,"Mr. Byrne, I -- I wasn't finished asking you about the background of this."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1366.67,1374.859,"Your Honor, there is a good bit not in the record on that, and I presume you want me to stick to the record in responding and there is no real explanation for that."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1397.456,1401.091,But it was what the Eleventh Circuit thought was a solution to this problem.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1401.091,1402.176,"It was, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1402.176,1403.443,And were they wrong in--
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1403.443,1414.333,"As a practical matter, Your Honor, yes, and also as a legal matter, because the Illinois courts cannot set aside the order here excepting the debt from discharge."
2012.11-1518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1439.116,1451.774,"The briefs -- the briefs on your side of the case say, well, you know, there is a series of words here: Fraud, defalcation, embezzlement, larceny."
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1485.514,1492.683,"Well, that is correct, Your Honor, that -- that that's the way that this particular version of the Bankruptcy Act is set up."
2012.11-1518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.527,1507.777,Yes.
2012.11-1518,0,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,1513.179,1514.697,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1517.899,1518.716,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1526.672,1529.374,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1537.546,1541.348,Was there a finding of recklessness in the State court?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1541.348,1542.114,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1581.489,1589.429,Is the crime of embezzlement proven if you show recklessness or do you need a further criminal intent?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1589.429,1597.183,"Generally speaking, Your Honor, embezzlement does require some sort of specific mental intent, an intent to deceive or to defraud."
2012.11-1518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1604.254,1606.623,"Well, of course, that's one of the things we are arguing about here."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1607.89,1613.044,"No, Your Honor, it's certainly not conceded, but it's borne out in the history of the Bankruptcy Act."
2012.11-1518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1638.176,1640.212,You think recklessness is required?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1640.212,1641.362,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2012.11-1518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1641.362,1643.397,You think recklessness is required?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1643.397,1643.897,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1646.682,1651.834,"Recklessness as to the law, as to what the law requires of the trustee."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1651.834,1655.871,"Recklessness as to the law, correct, Your Honor, but also as to the act."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1657.305,1658.405,"Wait, wait."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1704.4,1707.352,"No, Your Honor, and I apologize if I misspoke."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.987,1712.42,All right.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1763.02,1770.025,"--Your Honor, fraud, like embezzlement, does require a specific mental intent, but defalcation does not."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.025,1771.458,Why?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1783.616,1787.22,"Your Honor, defalcation must mean something other than fraud."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.236,1789.586,No.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1819.372,1822.308,"--When it's described like that, maybe, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.744,1830.996,I don't understand.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1838.35,1847.439,"--Your Honor, the courts have traditionally ascribed -- most courts have said that defalcation does require some form of reckless--"
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.439,1847.973,Perhaps so.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1850.508,1853.427,"--Your Honor, that's the genesis of this case."
2012.11-1518,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.427,1862.466,"What does it matter -- if the money is missing, what does it matter the reason why in terms of recklessness or intent?"
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1893.237,1900.924,"Possibly in the traditional sense there might not have been a loss, but there was a loss in the context of trust law, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1905.378,1911.115,"Well, the problem is that, yes, there was a breach of the trust."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1930.093,1941.401,"Maybe not in the traditional sense, but in the context of a fiduciary obligation a trustee is not allowed to benefit from his position as trustee."
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.401,1946.22,"Well, the -- why are you giving away that it's not in the traditional sense?"
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1956.009,1956.559,"Correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.559,1960.913,And he made a quarter million dollars that should have belonged to the trust.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,1972.886,1974.636,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1995.334,1998.452,But the question here -- the question here is not whether the trustee is liable.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2002.938,2004.272,"Correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2004.272,2013.545,"And if you look at the other, the other words in this list, fraud, embezzlement, larceny, those are bad acts."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2034.142,2039.946,"It is irrelevant, Your Honor, because a reasonable trustee would not act this way."
2012.11-1518,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2048.468,2056.305,"Well, what about a reasonable trustee who just invests very imprudently, an unreasonable trustee who invests very imprudently?"
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2071.015,2074.534,"If it's unreasonable, it would be, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.534,2083.892,"Is it -- before we leave this conduct, I mean, I understand I was painting you a picture of they're being innocent."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2090.895,2091.545,"Yes, sir."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.545,2098.315,"One principle I used to learn was he who has clean hands can come into equity, but nobody else."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2136.44,2137.542,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2137.542,2138.376,Because?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2138.376,2143.363,"Because, first of all, the bankruptcy court never made any specific finding of facts."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2147.482,2149.167,Did we remand it so they could?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2149.167,2156.854,"--No, Your Honor, because the Petitioner had every opportunity to bring those facts into -- into evidence at the bankruptcy court and he did not."
2012.11-1518,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2192.444,2201.717,So there's nothing in the record that shows why the bank refused to release any of the collateral.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2201.717,2203.319,"No, Your Honor, there is not."
2012.11-1518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2259.653,2266.309,"Well, a number of embezzlers -- not all of them -- many embezzlers fully intend to pay everything back once things turn out all right."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2290.174,2291.724,"It does, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2306.198,2311.683,"And the problem is, as the -- your friend on the other side points out, that there's two problems with this."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2323.74,2334.965,"--But, Your Honor, the subsequent inclusion of the terms fraud, embezzlement and larceny cannot retroactively modify or change the known definition of the word defalcation."
2012.11-1518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2389.352,2396.871,"Mr. Bensinger, if I heard you correctly, you said that the definition was a monetary deficiency arising from a breach of trust."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2402.592,2407.829,"Your Honor, there was a monetary deficiency in this case when the--"
2012.11-1518,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2407.829,2416.183,"Whether there was or was not in this case, but you're conceding that there has to be a monetary deficiency according to the traditional definitions."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2416.183,2416.851,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2427.224,2428.925,So are we fighting about the meaning of loss?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2430.442,2431.61,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2012.11-1518,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2431.61,2433.577,Are we fighting about what loss means?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2433.577,2442.483,"Your Honor, that is certainly an issue that the parties have contested in the briefs before this Court and in the courts below, whether there was a loss."
2012.11-1518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2459.012,2471.752,"So if he made nothing on the deal, and it just turns out he got whatever the -- the trust was getting under its interest rate and gave it back, there'd be no defalcation, because there'd be no loss in the sense of a lost opportunity?"
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2471.752,2475.387,"There would be a defalcation, Your Honor, but there would be no debt in that case."
2012.11-1518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.823,2477.423,I'm sorry.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2483.143,2487.612,"--Your Honor, there -- there needs to be a loss for there to be a debt."
2012.11-1518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2487.612,2488.631,Right.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2492.433,2493.549,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2507.291,2515.964,So taking the money out is sufficient for defalcation even if it's brought back in full and even if there is no lost opportunity.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2515.964,2516.764,"Correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2516.764,2521.282,That's not consistent with the original meaning of defalcation to which you were appealing.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2534.008,2534.791,Your Honor--
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.791,2537.393,You're saying defalcation just means breach of trust.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2538.01,2538.827,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.166,2549.185,"And that's what made it a defalcation, no?"
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2549.185,2550.068,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.068,2552.403,"Well, so then you say there has to be a cutting off."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2559.057,2562.359,"Your Honor, at that point, there was a--"
2012.11-1518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.359,2563.278,Why are you fighting that?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2567.496,2579.637,"--Your Honor, the loss in that case occurs -- Your Honor is absolutely right -- at the time that there is that cutting off, at the time in this case the Petitioner used the trust assets for his own benefit."
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2579.637,2580.87,And then what's the loss?
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2589.676,2590.509,Your Honor--
2012.11-1518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2590.509,2596.013,"The only part they don't have is the extra money that the trustee made, that there is no cutting down of the size of the trust."
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2599.265,2601.75,"--Because, Your Honor, the loss occurred."
2012.11-1518,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2611.775,2612.441,But he did.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2650.15,2658.754,"--Your Honor, the loss that the trust suffered was that its principal was taken away, was it invested by the trustee for his own benefit--"
2012.11-1518,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2658.754,2659.339,Yes.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2679.25,2688.525,"--The defalcation there, Your Honor, would be that the trustee has split his interest, has created a conflict of interest, and that causes a loss."
2012.11-1518,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2692.327,2697.797,I've never heard of a defalcation that didn't result in some monetary loss.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2701.266,2714.256,"In that case, Your Honor, there would not have been a strict monetary loss in that hypothetical had the -- all the proceeds -- had there not been any benefit that the trustee obtained from the investment and use of those funds."
2012.11-1518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2714.256,2716.539,But there is still a loss.
2012.11-1518,1,17427,bill_d_bensinger,,2731.968,2733.568,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2734.168,2743.106,Mr. Gannon?
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2743.106,2745.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1518,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2752.379,2756.099,"Unlike fraud -- fraud, larceny and embezzlement?"
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2756.099,2759.368,Each of those terms does have some mens rea associated with it.
2012.11-1518,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2792.956,2795.741,Because?
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2795.741,2796.91,--Pardon?
2012.11-1518,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.91,2797.66,Because?
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2810.351,2816.888,That would probably be embezzlement and it would be superfluous in that sense.
2012.11-1518,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2828.462,2830.228,"But you didn't cite to the Latin, did you?"
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2830.228,2831.062,--Pardon?
2012.11-1518,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2831.062,2846.507,"But you didn't have the Latin definition, which I take it from my colleague and it was confirmed by my law clerk, it comes from medieval Latin, starting with a sickle and meant to cut down, to cut down, and that suggested reduction."
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2846.507,2852.744,We did quote the Samuel Johnson dictionary and the Webster's 1828 dictionary that have that meaning.
2012.11-1518,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2872.239,2874.841,"Well, monetary deficiency, again, isn't that a loss?"
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2877.726,2890.953,"--Well, there are two questions there and I think that one of the illustrative quotations that the OED uses for that very definition doesn't actually refer to a monetary deficiency, and neither do most of the other dictionary definitions."
2012.11-1518,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2925.457,2926.042,"Well, that's certainly true--"
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2926.042,2926.676,--and he decided--
2012.11-1518,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2926.676,2938.95,"--in an ordinary trust, but isn't there a real question as to this trust, because if this trust would -- the trustee shouldn't have been investing this in the first place."
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2943.168,2947.139,--I don't think that's a fair statement of the way this trust operates.
2012.11-1518,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2977.492,2979.094,Would you just repeat what you said?
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2981.177,2987.447,"--The last part I said, that the parties have offered to lodge the trust instrument with the Court, but my understanding is that it's not in the record."
2012.11-1518,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2995.636,2997.138,That's what I understood.
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2998.722,3013.515,"I believe that that is not the case and that is not even consistent with Petitioner's own position in the State court, where he said he was taking this money and investing it in some alternative thing because he thought that would be safer than leaving the money with the life insurance company."
2012.11-1518,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3081.242,3087.563,"But there is two components of the award, the attorney's fees plus the $250,000 profit."
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3099.871,3103.157,--It's not that there -- it's not the opportunity loss.
2012.11-1518,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.19,3129.123,What about the other argument?
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3132.158,3133.008,--The other argument--
2012.11-1518,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3133.008,3137.31,In your brief you talk about and quote Learned Hand and say it means --
2012.11-1518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.28,3143.197,“ Malversation ”.
2012.11-1518,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.197,3148.184,--then it must be the same as fraud or embezzlement.
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3189.595,3201.402,--My response to that is that the Neal v. Clark decision that's being discussed here is -- and we discuss this in our brief -- is distinguishable in part because its current descendent is not this provision.
2012.11-1518,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3245.347,3249.549,"Could you explain what you mean, before your time expires, in footnote 18?"
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3261.274,3280.671,"--Well, I think when it gets further away from the heartland definition of defalcation, which does -- which, as was discussed in this Court's 1844 decision in Chapman and in the 1841 bankruptcy law, the defalcation was equated with self-dealing in trust assets."
2012.11-1518,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3292.761,3303.467,Where are courts supposed to look to find out what is the border between the heartland of defalcation and the badlands of defalcation and whatever else?
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3303.467,3318.309,"--Well, to be fair, the dictionary definitions are broad enough to include other types of fiduciary breaches, but it's not clear that that means that defalcation needs to be doing all the work here of potentially putting limits on the scope of the exception."
2012.11-1518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3339.073,3339.775,"Well, why not?"
2012.11-1518,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3353.849,3357.536,"Well, we certainly do think that that may well be the ultimate answer."
2012.11-1518,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3362.588,3363.44,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3365.19,3366.206,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-1518,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3366.206,3374.81,Is it your position that he couldn't have invested this?
2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3378.18,3387.452,"Assuming he knew, Your Honor, he could -- his position is and it was -- it was true his position in the State court was that he could have invested it, but--"

2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3388.902,3389.904,--As a trustee for the trust.
2012.11-1518,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3389.904,3390.654,Okay.
2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3393.106,3394.706,"Well, Your Honor, that is--"
2012.11-1518,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3394.706,3405.747,"Because if he could invest it for the trust, why isn't the loss -- isn't it a loss for the trust that he took this opportunity away from the trust?"
2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3405.747,3416.219,"--Well, Your Honor, the -- of course, the Illinois court never decided whether he was right about whether he could actually invest the money other than as -- as specified."
2012.11-1518,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3416.219,3417.221,Let's assume he could have.
2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3417.221,3419.421,If you assume he could have--
2012.11-1518,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3419.421,3421.873,Then why isn't the loss of opportunity?
2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3421.873,3430.895,"--Well, Your Honor, the -- the -- the trust instrument, I think you'll see does not expressly authorize him to do that."
2012.11-1518,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3432.581,3434.866,Let's assume his argument that he could.
2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3434.866,3446.591,"--If the argument is or if the trust provided that he could invest in other things and it made him prudent investments, then there could be a loss to the trust."
2012.11-1518,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3449.193,3453.495,"Then we have to go back to -- to the first issue, whether a mental state is required or not."
2012.11-1518,3,42397,thomas_m_byrne,,3453.495,3454.478,"That's correct, Your Honor."
