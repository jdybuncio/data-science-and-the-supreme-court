1978.77-891,0,19652,carol_los_mansmann,,67.066,68.464,Thank you Your Honor.
1978.77-891,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,133.42,136.306,But -- and the cutoff time is after viability and --
1978.77-891,0,19652,carol_los_mansmann,,136.306,137.688,"Yes Your Honor, that is correct."
1978.77-891,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,137.688,144.537,Is that defined in terms of the length of pregnancy or (Voice Overlap)?
1978.77-891,0,19652,carol_los_mansmann,,144.537,150.779,"No, it is not Your Honor, it's the capability of the fetus to survive outside the mother's womb although with artificial aid."
1978.77-891,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.779,154.72,But it says after viability not after likelihood or possibility of viability?
1978.77-891,0,19652,carol_los_mansmann,,154.72,156.12,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-891,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,177.216,186.027,Does that mean that his judgment and experience must be exercised in terms of reasonable medical certainty?
1978.77-891,0,19652,carol_los_mansmann,,186.027,187.548,Certainly it would Your Honor.
1978.77-891,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,235.169,249.706,Would you say that that language also must be read as meaning that the decision must be based on reasonable medical certainty as medical opinions are always gauged in litigation.
1978.77-891,0,19652,carol_los_mansmann,,249.706,272.941,"Absolutely Your Honor and I think the point I'm trying to make is that by adding the words or if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable, the legislature clearly intended to say to physicians in this type of practice in performing this highly specialized skill, that an objective standard will be placed upon them and that is reasonable medical certainty."
1978.77-891,1,39944,roland_morris,,1442.219,1445.864,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-891,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1702.912,1709.965,Are you speaking of an intrusion on the parents' right or the intrusion on the physician?
1978.77-891,1,39944,roland_morris,,1709.965,1718.93,"I'm speaking of an intrusion on both rights, sir, and of course under Doe, I come before you asserting the rights of the parents."
1978.77-891,2,19652,carol_los_mansmann,,2936.513,2940.684,There was a question that underlay a great deal of testimony in the lower court.
1978.77-891,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3006.818,3007.842,Thank you counsel.
