1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.706,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-367, Carol Ankenbrandt v. Jon A. Richards."
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,55.485,56.67,"Ducote, Chief Justice."
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,56.67,57.287,Ducote... Mr. Ducote.
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,59.872,72.096,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I represent two young girls, one 9 and one 7, who come before you through their mother as their next friend."
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.571,202.731,"Well, we could go further, could we not, Mr. Ducote, in saying what the case is not about, in saying that it is not about a decree of divorce, it is not about child custody, it's not about probate... something like that?"
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,202.731,203.347,That's correct.
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.866,292.741,"Well, but you... in your earlier answers to the chief justice you seem to be saying that well, if it were a family matter, that would be a different question."
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,302.43,310.202,"--Well, one of the questions the court asked is whether or not there is a Federal... a domestic relations exception to Federal jurisdiction."
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.202,310.835,That's right.
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,310.835,324.51,"My position is that if the diversity criteria are met and the amount in controversy exceeds the $50,000 threshold, no matter what the source of the money is, it should be within Federal jurisdiction unless Congress determines otherwise."
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.51,325.712,So you can sue in Federal court for divorce.
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,325.712,336.234,"Well, I don't believe so, because divorce itself has no $50,000 threshold, nor does child custody, nor does child visitation."
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.208,359.516,"Well, what if a husband sues for a divorce and requests a property settlement agreement, saying that the amount of controversy, our property, amounts to several hundred thousand dollars."
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,362.901,380.68,"Unfortunately, at this point, given the fact that the Federal jurisdiction is defined by Congress and Congress is not exempted, that sort of question from the diversity of jurisdiction, I think to be true to the Constitution, yes, the Federal courts would have jurisdiction."
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.68,386.001,"We really don't have to decide that question, do we, to rule in your favor?"
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,397.741,398.676,That's absolutely correct.
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.676,408.866,What about a suit for the partition of real estate in another State?
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,427.911,454.245,"My position is that if the diversity criteria are met and the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000 and the State law that's applicable in the jurisdiction where the Federal court sits allows for that cause of action, the Federal courts under Article 3 and the congressional mandate under 28 U.S.C. section 1332 says that you have jurisdiction."
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.245,471.022,Don't you think that that congressional mandate took into account accepted notions of transitory causes of action and nontransitory causes of action so that it was entirely understood that to get a divorce you could only sue in the court of the State where the people are resident?
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,471.022,480.462,"I think first you have to look at the State law, and whatever the State where the forum sits says about what can be done with property that another State would control."
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.215,535.732,They're not defining their own.
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,556.545,557.914,--I agree.
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.914,562.966,Can a State attorney bring in Federal court a prosecution for a State crime?
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,562.966,594.501,"No, but in the diversity cases... and that's the unique nature of diversity jurisdiction... diversity jurisdiction specifically deals with local causes of action, local concerns, and simply says that because of this... in the Bullone case it's expressed, the concern about local prejudice, and then the... sort of the equal footing that nonState parties should have in that court, that the Federal courts should have diversity of jurisdiction."
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.501,614.315,"In some of our cases, Mr. Ducote, we've said that when Congress enacts a jurisdictional measure it takes it with knowledge of any judicial gloss on it, so to speak, such as Canon v. University of Chicago."
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,642.398,682.292,"Well, the Court... the last pronouncement was in the 1930's on the domestic relations exception, except for Thompson v. Thompson in 1988, when in a footnote the Court talked about the tradition of the domestic relations exception, and what I'm saying... and again, I don't think this is essential for us to prevail in this cause of action, but I think what we have to do is sort of pull that all back together and make some sense out of it and get back to the issue that Congress needs to set out what the parameters of Federal jurisdiction are and what are the exceptions."
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,722.5,730.273,Is there any suggestion that that was done in the light of this Court's statement about the domestic relations exception?
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,730.273,749.985,"--I think it had to do with perhaps some of the other abstention doctrines, Younger v. Colorado Water District, but I think if we're going to have exceptions to Federal jurisdiction, or we're going to allow for abstention of Federal jurisdiction, then I think it should be by congressional mandate and not by judicial activism."
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.985,758.572,"Well, but these cases, speaking of the domestic relations exception, have been on the books... our books for a long time."
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,760.006,766.66,The specific issue in this case has never been addressed by the Court.
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,766.66,794.347,"Absolutely right, and one could easily say that those cases referred to things like seeking a decree of divorce, child custody, other nontransitory causes of action, and that therefore your case is not governed by them, but when you get into the more general area, it seems to me you're arguing for just a rather sweeping clearing of the brush, so to speak, which I'm not sure isn't inconsistent with all our cases."
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,794.347,820.997,"Well, I think the cases of Burrus and Barber and Popovici and De La Rama v. De La Rama have simply said in very broad brush strokes the relations between husband and wife, parent and child, belong to the States and we're not going to get involved in it, and those cases have sort of set up judicial chaos for 100 years in all of the circuits that have led to this sort of decision."
1991.91-367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,878.668,894.443,"Counsel, before you get to that point, suppose that in this case the mother was involved in the proceedings in the Louisiana domestic court and the court made findings of fact that the abuse had not occurred?"
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,905.335,907.603,Under Louisiana law it would not.
1991.91-367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,907.603,908.686,It would not.
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,908.686,915.673,Louisiana probably has the most restrictive issue preclusion statutes in the country.
1991.91-367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,915.673,938.038,"I think that in other States it would, although I'm not sure of that, and if that's so then my next question would be if there would be issue preclusion going back the other way, if the tort were tried first, I assume it would not be a violation of due process at least for a domestic court, say, that this has already been litigated and it's going to accept those findings."
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,938.038,939.155,I don't think so.
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.892,1056.411,"Mr. Ducote, was there any equitable relief sought in this case?"
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,1056.411,1056.661,Absolutely none.
1991.91-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.613,1062.029,It might be a different case if there were equitable relief.
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,1080.157,1117.247,"I have no problem with that, and as Justice Kennedy discussed in the case of McIntyre v. McIntyre in the Ninth Circuit, when issues of status are not involved and the court... the Federal court has not asked to impinge on the State supervision of a minor and it's just simply an issue of compensatory damages, it's like every other case, and again we just can't simply say well, this is family business and we don't like to be involved in family business that--"
1991.91-367,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1117.247,1120.282,"Counsel, I'm interested from a practical point of view."
1991.91-367,0,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,1125.935,1127.351,"--Well, I think there are two points."
1991.91-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.201,1178.168,"Very well, Mr. Ducote."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1180.668,1193.511,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.91-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.152,1210.353,"Mr. Weidenfeld, you just use the word abstention."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1211.639,1212.072,I did.
1991.91-367,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1256.148,1260.636,"Of course, that general proposition doesn't give us the answer to this case, yet."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1260.636,1277.646,"No, it doesn't Your Honor, but of course this Court has asked to address that issue, at least in brief, and I think that as a matter... it has to be accepted that there is a domestic relations exception to jurisdiction."
1991.91-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1293.19,1306.915,"Mr. Weidenfeld, do you think the exception which you would have us continue to recognize is based on the Constitution, or is it something statutory?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1308.783,1320.924,I think that the exception goes back to the concept of the Tenth Amendment in that it actually was a matter not delegated to the Federal Government.
1991.91-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1330.446,1345.872,"So you don't think Congress could directly address this, and for instance in the parental kidnapping case direct Federal courts to have jurisdiction of certain family related matters?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1345.872,1359.93,"The common understanding at the time was that matters domestic... that is, matters involving parent and child, husband and wife, were excluded from the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in that--"
1991.91-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1359.93,1360.096,Yes.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1377.307,1380.259,"--Well, I think that--"
1991.91-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1380.259,1382.609,Yes or no.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1382.609,1392.15,"--No, not as it stands, and this Court has found that it did not, of course, in Thompson v. Thompson."
1991.91-367,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1421.218,1427.574,--you're pressing for an exception to Federal jurisdiction.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1433.375,1439.112,"--No, not in the context of the domestic relation exception to jurisdiction."
1991.91-367,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1457.676,1476.154,"Well, they certainly are different, but I'm wondering if all through the years we're really speaking of the Federal courts abstaining from getting into this area rather than formulating a nonstatutory exception, so to speak, to diversity jurisdiction."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1476.154,1482.291,"Well, the... the broader concepts I think lead to the same place."
1991.91-367,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1512.728,1528.105,"Well, isn't it dangerous to read into the Constitution what isn't there, to wit, a domestic relations exception to Federal jurisdiction, and aren't we on sounder ground if we were talking about abstention, as maybe the Court should have done over the years?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1528.105,1534.593,"Well, it is always dangerous to read things into the Constitution."
1991.91-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.987,1610.605,"But that really is a question of what law is applicable, isn't it, rather than whether there's jurisdiction?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1623.448,1643.362,"That's correct, Your Honor, my point being that the States have... that each State has its own set of rules involving parent... the domestic harmony, and the results that involve the interrelationship between spouses and between parents and children."
1991.91-367,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1652.633,1656.585,"Well, we may have deferred to it, but it doesn't make it jurisdictional, does it?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1656.585,1676.999,"Well, by this Court's phrasing of the... by this Court's prior determinations that domestic matters are jurisdictional, the question that leads to is, is it a domestic matter, and how do we decide if something involves the domestic relations."
1991.91-367,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1693.008,1702.38,"So you think it's... your criterion of what is domestic looks to the State law of capacity, is that what you're saying?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1702.38,1704.066,--I'm saying that's a factor.
1991.91-367,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1768.756,1783.248,"So in any case these are sort of pointers as to what presumably the Court may have had in mind and Congress may have had in mind perhaps in ratifying what we did, but you're not making the argument that every State law with respect to capacity is jurisdictional--"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1783.248,1783.6,No.
1991.91-367,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1783.6,1784.883,--With respect to Federal jurisdiction.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1784.883,1794.206,"No, Your Honor, I'm not making that argument, and I'm not making the argument that any tort involves... is domestic."
1991.91-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.343,1842.804,If a wife kills her husband somehow in violation of Federal law is it your position that a Federal criminal court could not entertain the suit because that involves domestic matters?
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1842.804,1847.923,I have not addressed the interplay between the--
1991.91-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.923,1848.542,I know you haven't.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1849.775,1853.66,"--Would you repeat the question, Your Honor?"
1991.91-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.66,1867.587,"If a wife kills her husband in some manner that violates Federal law, using a handgun that's been carried interstate or something like that, is it your position that there can be no Federal prosecution because it's a domestic matter?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1867.587,1868.137,No.
1991.91-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.137,1880.929,"Well, why is that different from a tort in which a wife hits her husband, and then the next question is going to be why is that different from a tort in which a father hits his son?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1880.929,1884.298,Because Congress has made that a crime.
1991.91-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.975,1905.427,"This is not a spouse-killing Federal crime, it's a general Federal criminal statute."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1917.133,1931.392,"But there's... the answer is there has never... at least my answer is there has never been any case that has excluded that as a matter of being a domestic case, whereas there have been in the civil arena."
1991.91-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.568,1955.174,"May I ask you, among these cases... I'm just not as familiar as I should be with the earlier cases."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1963.03,1964.731,"No... No, Your Honor."
1991.91-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.731,1971.818,"They were... under the Popovici case they were trying to... suing under Bassett or something or something like that, wasn't it?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1971.818,1981.657,"Under the original jurisdiction of the Court, and In re Burrus it was a habeas case--"
1991.91-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.657,1981.891,Right.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,1981.891,1987.394,"--In Simms and De La Rama, they were both cases that emanated from the territories."
1991.91-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1987.394,2001.654,"What is your answer if a child is battered, receives severe injuries and sues for medical payments, sues the father through a next friend?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2001.654,2005.122,In Federal court?
1991.91-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2005.122,2005.422,Yes.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2005.422,2011.61,Is it during... the tort occurred during the existence of the marriage?
1991.91-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.61,2012.212,Yes.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2012.212,2014.914,Then it's going to be a matter--
1991.91-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2014.914,2018.032,This is a child suing the parent.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2018.032,2048.301,"--That would be a matter that would go to the... that would fall within the domestic relations exception and it should go to State court as a part of the State court's unitary system that involves their special interest in the family, because when you're dealing with the family, that is a matter that is uniquely the State's concern... the health and well-being of the domestic harmony of the families within it."
1991.91-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.792,2205.219,"Mr. Weidenfeld, a few minutes ago you were asked by Justice Stevens whether there had been any cases sounding of diversity jurisdiction in which this statement as to the domestic relations exception had been announced."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2211.622,2213.622,"That was diversity, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.859,2236.071,"Yes, and that certainly suggests that even back then, December term 1858, that the Court saw definite limits to the domestic relations exception, doesn't it?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2243.725,2250.58,"--Yes, they did, Mr. Chief Justice, and the... so that yes, I agree that there is a limit to it."
1991.91-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2309.536,2313.738,"But Mr. Weidenfeld, the State court is through with this case."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2325.962,2334.567,"Justice O'Connor, these cases never end."
1991.91-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2438.735,2448.924,"In Louisiana, is it open to a third party stranger to come in and reopen a question like that?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2448.924,2453.876,"Well, it is always a matter that's open."
1991.91-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2464.95,2493.35,"In another sense that doesn't help you, though, because if the Federal court enters a judgment making certain findings as, let's say the child abuse did occur, if the proceeding is always open in Louisiana and if Louisiana does not give preclusive effect to that determination, the jurisdiction of the Louisiana court remains unfettered and unconstrained by the Federal judgment."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2493.35,2508.877,"That's... that would be correct, and what... but what would happen is you now have the Federal courts telling the State courts that we don't... that really you haven't done it correctly."
1991.91-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2513.28,2523.886,"But the State court is just as free as it would have been if there had been no Federal proceeding at all, as I understand both your submission and that of your opposing counsel."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2523.886,2527.106,That's correct.
1991.91-367,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2527.106,2543.45,"Well, couldn't... are you agreeing that you could not claim collateral estoppal, an offensive use, let's say, of collateral estoppal in a State court if the State proceeding is left open and there has been a determination and judgment in the Federal proceeding?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2543.45,2548.187,That there'd be no collateral estoppal as between the State proceeding and the Federal proceeding?
1991.91-367,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2548.187,2550.603,"No, the other way around."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2578.806,2580.908,"That... yes, that's correct."
1991.91-367,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2580.908,2581.524,Okay.
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2581.524,2587.228,And what would happen is that... and then you see what happens.
1991.91-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.961,2620.699,"But Mr. Weidenfeld, there are a lot of tort actions that could have an effect on a custody decree."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2657.538,2658.121,No.
1991.91-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.227,2674.214,"Well, I know that's your test because it fits your case, but I don't know why the one is any more logical than the other."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2674.214,2682.069,"--Well, the State has no interest or no involvement in the other, per se."
1991.91-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2703.067,2712.023,"But for Younger, even in the criminal context there has to be a pending proceeding, doesn't there, a pending proceeding in the State court?"
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2712.023,2730.817,"There does, and I think that the pending proceeding is the... and this is a stretch which I admit, but the pending nature of the proceeding is that custody is always pending, is always on-going, because the State's interest never ends."
1991.91-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.817,2736.621,"Well, we don't need a domestic relations exception then, if we have that sort of an abstention doctrine."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2739.906,2741.192,I agree with that.
1991.91-367,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2770.609,2773.978,"Counsel, one question for clarification."
1991.91-367,1,38439,paul_s_weidenfeld,,2784.766,2791.355,"It would not... well, in two ways."
1991.91-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2888.25,2891.119,"Thank you, Mr. Weidenfeld."
1991.91-367,2,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,2894.904,2897.69,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.91-367,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2943.385,2945.302,He could never get custody back.
1991.91-367,2,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,2945.302,2951.122,He would have no right of action under State law because he's a legal stranger to the children.
1991.91-367,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2979.642,2987.747,"Well, most... all of us I guess react by where our own practice was."
1991.91-367,2,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,3017.1,3025.171,"Well, commencing about the 1970's virtually every State has enacted termination of parental rights statutes because of the child abuse problem."
1991.91-367,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3042.764,3053.488,Would you be here making the same argument if instead custody had been awarded to the mother but no termination of parental rights?
1991.91-367,2,39087,richard_lynn_ducote,,3058.975,3059.508,Certainly.
1991.91-367,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3116.562,3118.864,"Thank you, Mr. Ducote."
