1965.51,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.655,"-- J. Hicks, Petitioner versus District of Columbia."
1965.51,0,35097,lawrence_speiser,,12.913,21.328,I move the admission of Charles Wolfram of the District of Columbia Bar of Ohio -- in order to argue this case for the appellant.
1965.51,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,21.328,24.537,Mr. Wolfram maybe admitted for that purpose.
1965.51,1,20410,charles_w_wolfram,,42.131,45.127,May it please the Court.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,2815.171,2819.518,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2921.448,2923.309,This is not in your brief on --
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,2923.309,2924.937,This is not in the brief.
1965.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2927.049,2929.298,But it is not in your memorandum on mootness here?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,2929.298,2939.508,"We cited but we did not – of course we were anxious to get it in, we did not quote it, but we did cite the code section."
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3139.632,3140.345,Mr. Pair.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3140.345,3141.388,Yes Mr. Fortas.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3141.388,3173.688,[Inaudible]
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3173.688,3173.921,No.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3210.019,3239.946,So nothing is the statute [Inaudible]
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3239.946,3243.579,"Nothing, Justice Fortas except the language of the statute itself."
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3285.628,3326.072,[Inaudible] one of those statute is the vagrancy statue with which we're here concerned and I think there's a similar provision in the statue on prostitution in the District of Columbia Code and I think those have been on the statue books for a while.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3333.961,3338.141,"That's correct, yes."
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3338.141,3349.129,Is it your view that the general statute supersedes the special provisions in the vagrancy statute and the prostitution statute?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3349.129,3351.749,"No Justice Fortas, I think that they're consistent."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3387.283,3395.442,"[Inaudible] any of the statute, this one at page 60 of the petitioner's brief."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3420.513,3422.522,I don't think so Justice Brennan.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3422.522,3430.89,There's nothing in -- is there anything in that -- as these wordings might suggest that he could not.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3430.89,3447.742,"No, not from the language of the statute but immediately preceding sentence is certainly contemplates of the court would impose conditions before it get suspended the imposition of sentence."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3476.714,3488.601,"Well if that's right, is the imposition of conditions a -- it sounds like condition to the imposition -- of the suspension of the imposition of sentence?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3488.601,3493.245,"I would think that to be implicit, that unless conditions were imposed --"
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3493.245,3496.117,"Well then there has been no sentence here at all if that's right, isn't it?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3496.117,3497.89,There's has been no sentence.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3497.89,3500.102,Mr. Pair [Inaudible]
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3500.102,3501.01,Yes Justice Warren.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3501.01,3506.318,"It's an idle act from the part of the court to say, judgment is suspended?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3506.318,3508.576,"No, Justice -- Chief Justice Warren."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3533.31,3537.049,You mean it's tantamount to saying there shall be no punishment?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3537.049,3540.397,"I think so, very definitely Chief Justice Warren."
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3541.215,3544.787,Why couldn't there be a sentence imposed now?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3544.787,3553.864,Because I think the empathy -- because of the expiration of the period for which he could have been --
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3553.864,3561.968,"But he wasn't sentenced at all, you say it's void sentence and if that's the case, you have a man who's convicted and never been sentenced."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3563.413,3567.418,Because the suspension – imposition of sentence was suspended.
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3567.418,3576.278,Imposition of sentence is suspended but you say that there's no sentence at all had been imposed?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3576.278,3583.013,No sentence was imposed but the judgment of the Court was and that judgment remains undisturbed.
1965.51,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3589.597,3593.875,For our law?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3593.875,3596.184,"Well, there's no mention of any particular period."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3596.184,3608.982,"But Mr. Pair, I know that you must have some theory on that -- is if he has – if it is suspended for any period, certainly a man would be entitled to know -- if you don't know how would he know?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3608.982,3612.681,"Well, I think he would go by the penalty provisions of the act."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3612.681,3613.824,I beg pardon?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3613.824,3615.752,The penalty provisions of the act.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3615.752,3624.587,"In other words, he is suspended for one year plus 90 days?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3624.587,3626.196,"Well, certainly not longer than that --"
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3626.196,3629.927,"Well, if not that long, how much less?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3638.933,3645.034,There was a man -- but not called -- this man what bears on it I think Chief Justice.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3645.034,3646.766,Beg pardon?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3646.766,3657.206,"What I think the answer to it is, is in the statute which the first sentence of Section 16710, this is the Act of Congress."
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3662.677,3664.768,But not [Inaudible] execution of sentence.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3664.768,3670.838,"Says nothing about the execution and says nothing about conditions, the first sentence."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3690.944,3692.242,For how long?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3692.242,3693.688,It doesn't say it.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3693.688,3694.984,What do you say?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3694.984,3703.027,I would say that it is the imposition of sentence is suspended forever.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3707.632,3713.307,Then Congress intended that -- to have the court to perform an idle act?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3713.307,3713.484,No.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3727.586,3732.672,This is to say that this was a power in the trial court of understanding this --
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3732.672,3733.318,Yeah.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3733.318,3738.053,By this device of imposition of sentence suspended without conditions.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3738.053,3738.306,Without condition.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3738.306,3750.942,"Without conditions and that that in effect was to say, this is a case and that Congress empowered the judge to do this were all that ever impose the sentence and none shall ever be impose not withstanding the finding of guilt."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3750.942,3753.318,"Yes Justice Brennan, that is our position."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3781.258,3788.665,Where does it say if it's -- if sentence is suspended with conditions.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3788.665,3789.823,Sir where does it say that?
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3789.823,3791.504,Yes.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3791.504,3794.261,In case of the imposition of sentence --
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3794.261,3795.254,Beg pardon?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3795.254,3796.982,I was reading the -- read on the statute?
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3796.982,3797.682,Yes.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3797.682,3800.474,In the case of the imposition of sentence.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3800.474,3801.517,Imposition of the sentence.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3801.517,3802.256,Of sentence.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3802.256,3806.32,Yes.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3806.32,3809.715,And the suspension of execution thereof.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3809.715,3811.02,Yes.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3811.02,3818.341,The court may place the defendant on probation under the control and supervision of the probation officer.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3818.341,3818.974,Yeah.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3818.974,3829.312,The probationer shall be provided by the clerk of the court with a written statement of the terms and conditions of his probation at the time when he's placed thereof.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3836.922,3848.728,"But that statute doesn't govern here about the vagrancy statute which covers the same ground covered here, is that what you told me earlier, did I misunderstand you."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3848.728,3852.215,"No, I think the two statutes are entirely consistent."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3883.171,3896.66,"I wonder why Congress send to the -- better this imposition of sentence suspended, I was in a couch in the physiology of the judge shall have the power in proper cases not to impose anything."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3905.748,3906.994,And what have been the --
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3906.994,3909.215,Suspend imposition of sentence?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3909.215,3923.777,"Perhaps the language could have been the clearer, but this is a language and it does seem to be consistent that Congress was talking about two things."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3923.777,3929.965,"I notice in the official record apparently the judge uses stamp for this, doesn't he?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3941.036,3942.039,That's correct Justice Brennan.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3942.039,3944.798,"And that's the stamp he uses it, isn't it?(Voice Overlap)"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3944.798,3952.153,And the clerk -- the clerk under the direction of the trial judge affixes thing --
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3952.153,3955.674,Does that suggest that this is a sort of thing that's done quite often?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3955.674,3958.459,This is a practice.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3958.459,3960.121,Okay.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3960.121,3960.933,Mr. Pair?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,3960.933,3962.176,Yes sir.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3962.176,3968.73,I think it's so important for us to understand this situation.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4020.326,4023.166,We do not think so Justice Fortas for this --
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4023.166,4025.102,Do you think that would have been unlawful?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4025.102,4026.602,I think it would have been.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4026.602,4028.256,And that's the position in the District of Columbia?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4028.256,4032.981,"That is the position and, if I may I'd like to state why it is our position."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4072.282,4082.322,[Inaudible] this vagueness argument it ought to be addressed to this sentencing provision.[Laughter]
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4082.322,4094.334,"Great many years ago and that in substance as the district's position on the vagrancy -- I mean, on the mootness question."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4100.774,4102.481,May I ask you this Mr. Pair?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4122.97,4129.551,I think it would be wiped out to the -- down to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4129.551,4145.568,"It seem we don't do it that way as -- if I'm correct in my recollection, I think the ordinarily where -- where we find something as mootness we move -- we set aside the judgment and direct wiping of the slate all the way down to the initial judgment?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4145.568,4157.404,"Yes, the district suggest Justice Brennan that this question of mootness became ripe only upon the exploration, giving look and that the case in a light most favorable to the petitioner."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4165.1,4169.227,And that would have been about September of 1964?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4169.227,4173.923,"About December of 1965 -- no, about -- that would--"
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4173.923,4178.899,"I thought the judgment was June 13, 1963, is that right?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4178.899,4179.24,Yes.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4203.832,4205.021,But not very long.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4205.021,4205.172,No.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4212.22,4215.839,Well that would be September 1964.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4215.839,4217.745,1964.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4217.745,4227.375,You are to find to be just as moot when the judgment was ripe –-
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4227.375,4241.916,"Chief Justice Warren, I think it would be, but assuming that there remained some latent power in the court and I don't think there remained in the latent power under the second stanzas of this particular case."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4259.996,4273.055,"Well, under your main argument that it becomes moot as of the time the judgment was rendered, how could a man ever get his rights vindicated up here?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4276.057,4282.136,"Well, under the procedure we have in the -- he has -- and there has been a case on this."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4282.136,4283.035,Beg pardon?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4283.035,4299.994,As -- we do have a case in the -- in our jurisdiction in which the right of a criminal defendant who is sentenced -- the imposition of sentence was suspended.
1965.51,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4340.284,4343.446,"That right was certainly accorded in this case, wasn't it?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4343.446,4346.631,Yes Justice Stewart.
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4346.631,4356.119,But I ask you to answer that you -- if we consider the case moot when the time of judgment was entered.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4356.119,4376.567,"Well, I said under the peculiar facts that I perhaps conceded too much, I can see -- that say, I think it is moot but not subject to -- but not moot to the point of defeating the man's right to an appeal because he did appeal and our courts have said there is."
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4376.567,4378.126,Just a bit moot.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4378.126,4378.497,Pardon --
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4378.497,4382.128,Just a little bit moot.[Laughter]
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4382.128,4393.558,"Well certainly, moot for the purpose of -- for the purpose of the proceedings before this Court."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4393.558,4407.519,"Well it would be the same business wouldn't it Mr Pair because a judge had power and not to sentence, he didn't sentence, it's moot and therefore a conviction stands and the man can do nothing about it."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4408.692,4409.753,It would make sense.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4432.693,4449.611,But how does that square with your statement that it's practically an idle act for the judge to say that the judgment is suspended as he did in this case and that as -- he has no power to do anything further.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4449.611,4453.471,"But Chief Justice Warren, I (Voice Overlap) I don't think it's an idle act."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4492.107,4503.998,"I'm wondering this, suppose the judge said, “I'll give you a suspended judgment of 30 days.”"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4514.624,4515.916,No Chief Justice Warren.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4531.618,4537.392,"Suppose he didn't put any conditions, I suspend your sentence for 30 days."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4537.392,4537.665,I don't know if any authority.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4537.665,4540.156,I give you 30 days to suspend the judgment.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4540.156,4544.148,I don't know of any authority that the trial court would have to do that.
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4544.148,4548.923,When this -- do you know of any direct authority that says he can do what he did here and make --
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4548.923,4552.134,The statute itself -- the statute.
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4591.405,4612.419,"May I ask you if there is a misprint on the page 60 on this fact that it says -- it said, the imposition or execution of sentence maybe suspended for such period that the court may direct, and the court may and or before the expiration of such period remand such sentence."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4618.737,4618.987,No.
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4621.359,4627.2,"What's meant by that, remand it to whom and where for what?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4627.2,4643.735,"I mean, recall it I suppose and suspend this -- not to suspend it but to wipe it out or to cause it to be executed."
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4646.025,4649.909,Do you think that's the correct word?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4649.909,4650.916,I --
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4650.916,4652.49,You haven't [Inaudible]
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4652.49,4654.682,This is in the partition of the brief and --
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4654.682,4663.316,"The thing it bothers me, I don't see how we can hold what you say without completely rewriting this part of the sentence."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4676.05,4677.172,Conditions.
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4677.172,4696.672,"Well, condition has -- it doesn't leave any impression there that he could suspend it only for a period for which a sentence could be imposed."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4696.672,4703.937,"Well Justice Black, we have two Acts of Congress, and they are not inconsistent."
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4704.449,4706.327,I am talking about this act.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4712.402,4719.005,But we can construe the -- couldn't apply the other act if there is any --
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4719.005,4721.302,That would be a different thing.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4729.406,4733.57,But I think this -- I think you could do it this way Justice Black.
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4740.963,4743.425,"I am not talking about -- I am talking about the Act, not the record."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4743.425,4745.654,I am speaking of the Act.
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4765.889,4771.125,"Well that's just an uncompleted action on the part of the judge, isn't it?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4771.125,4779.729,"Well, I think it'll be a violation of due process to bring him back now and impose conditions upon him."
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4784.884,4796.158,"Well all -- isn't that in line with the original idea that court should involve where the statute -- while the law did not give them the right to grant probation, and they wanted to do so."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4815.463,4816.213,"Well, this -- I think --"
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4816.213,4820.7,"I am not talking about execution, finding the execution."
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4823.7,4838.478,"But that Justice Black, whatever was in the mind of the Congress and subsequently passing the general statutes, whatever doubt there may have existed was removed by the language and the general statute."
1965.51,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4846.952,4847.858,"Otherwise, again --"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4847.858,4869.063,"And even if there was ambiguity in the Vagrancy Act, and it doesn't appear to me, it seems to be entirely consistent on any view of this record because no conditions, whatever were imposed upon this criminal defendant."
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4869.063,4885.134,"Is this just an isolated case, an isolated judgment or is this more or less common practice in the district -- does -- do the judges normally or often say just what this judge said here?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4885.134,4888.217,"In the less serious criminal offenses, yes Chief Justice --"
1965.51,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4888.217,4895.95,"Just says less serious, now would you name the most that consider less serious?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4895.95,4916.62,"Well just -- I think drunk and disorderly cases, vagrancy cases, traffic cases, disorderly conduct cases, loitering cases, of that kind."
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4916.62,4917.637,Mr. Pair.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4917.637,4919.814,Yes Justice Fortas.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4919.814,4929.476,"When the -- there are instances that which shown to the vagrancy statute, the judge does impose conditions, is that right?"
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4929.476,4930.564,Yes Justice Fortas.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4930.564,4946.353,And do those appear on the record inquiry as a matter of the way that court is run or do they just take the form of a lecture which to the person who is convicted?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4946.353,4946.625,No.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4952.867,4953.127,Yes.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4982.209,4984.717,"No, that would be unofficial record made of it."
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4984.717,4984.949,Do you think from --
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4984.949,4988.597,"It would be in the criminal file, the terms of the conditions."
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4988.597,4989.745,You feel confident about it?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4989.745,4991.938,I'm confident of that.
1965.51,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4991.938,4993.7,And unless --
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4993.7,4994.442,Conviction --
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,4994.442,5003.639,"But not -- now what would be and I say would be the notation take -- the court takes his personal bond, that would be stamped on the information."
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5003.639,5009.313,But would -- there would -- would there be stamp on that condition's imposed?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,5009.313,5010.93,Only if conditions were imposed.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5010.93,5011.694,That's what I mean.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,5011.694,5011.938,Yes --
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5011.938,5013.66,Then it would have appear on the record?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,5013.66,5017.372,But the conditions themselves would not appear on the record.
1965.51,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5017.372,5019.91,Just the -- something like conditions imposed.
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,5019.91,5021.155,"Yes, that would -- yes."
1965.51,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5265.552,5274.875,You consider the petitioner's position to be either here under 1651 or not all?
1965.51,2,27835,hubert_b_pair,,5274.875,5285.305,"I think he is retreated to that point, that was I understand them, but I will address myself to both upon he's not properly here on the ended theory."
1965.51,3,20410,charles_w_wolfram,,6333.837,6336.181,May it please the Court.
1965.51,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6357.953,6361.616,"Within ten days, yes sir."
1965.51,3,20410,charles_w_wolfram,,6361.616,6371.532,"On the mootness point itself, I should point out that whether or not a man can still be imprisoned, it's not the only question when considering mootness."
1965.51,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6408.813,6415.693,[Inaudible]
1965.51,3,20410,charles_w_wolfram,,6415.693,6420.597,I don't think Mr. Hicks would like to come to the Supreme Court every time he's charged with vagrancy.
1965.51,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6420.597,6427.851,We recess now.
1965.51,3,20410,charles_w_wolfram,,6429.392,6434.774,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice Warren.
1965.51,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6457.13,6458.068,Pay for it?
1965.51,3,20410,charles_w_wolfram,,6458.068,6459.272,He must pay for it.
