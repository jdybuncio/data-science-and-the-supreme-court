1988.88-605,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.467,"We will hear argument now in No. 88-605, William L. Webster versus Reproductive Health Services."
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,11.24,36.828,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court, this case represents a direct appeal that involves a 1986 Missouri statute defining the rights of the unborn and regulating abortion in Missouri."
1988.88-605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.068,133.641,"Mr. Webster, is that the argument you made below?"
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,133.641,135.832,There were three sections.
1988.88-605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,135.832,136.413,Yes I know.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,139.895,140.276,Yes.
1988.88-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.259,189.723,"So some part of the decision below you don't appeal, especially in the speech area?"
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,189.723,193.644,There are two provisions in the speech area that are not before this court.
1988.88-605,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,200.259,202.062,So you don't challenge the judgment below in that respect?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,202.062,202.472,--We have not challenged those.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.769,272.6,"General Webster, can I ask you one clarifying question?"
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,280.006,287.392,We have a separate specific statute in Missouri which prohibits abortions which occur at viability.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.354,300.008,"I am just asking if one violates Section 205 or 210 or 215, is there any sanction for violation?"
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,300.008,302.709,To my knowledge there is no sanction for violation.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.709,303.531,It is not a misdemeanor?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,307.203,311.875,The language here is directed towards those bodies that expend the public funds.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,311.875,312.256,Right.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,312.256,319.442,Public funds whether it's related to encouraging or counseling or the expenditure of public funds for the performance of abortion.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.031,337.183,"What if a doctor who had a patient in a public hospital went ahead and performed in the first trimester, performed an abortion."
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,340.846,354.446,"This particular chapter, 188, carries a general Class A misdemeanor penalty for violations of the initial sections, but there is no operative language in the 1986 statute."
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,354.446,355.496,So it would be a misdemeanor then?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,355.496,357.268,Arguably it would be a misdemeanor.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.268,358.009,What is your opinion?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,360.413,371.218,"My opinion is that there is no language in that section which was adopted here which would suggest that it would make it a criminal offense, only that it is directed to those bodies expending the public funds themselves."
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.218,375.292,Is it your opinion as the chief law enforcement officer of the state that it would not be a misdemeanor?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,375.292,378.204,"We wouldn't view that violation as a misdemeanor, no."
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.204,380.945,Is there any enforcement provision other than injunctive relief?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,385.167,392.372,That is the only enforcement power that we would presume contained in the language which was enacted in the 1986 statute.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.372,394.033,Wouldn't it be grounds for discharge or cause?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,394.033,405.153,"It is conceivable the hospital board could if somebody violated the policy of that facility, seek to discharge that particular employee."
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.92,408.003,The statute says it shall be unlawful.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,409.032,414.048,--We would presume that would be an opportunity available.
1988.88-605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.048,422.022,I might also be the official who expends the funds knowing they are going to be used in violation of the statute is liable for the funds.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,427.986,431.519,That certainly would be one of the appropriate remedies.
1988.88-605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,609.627,612.919,"You also contend there is no case of controversy on that point, I take it?"
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,612.919,615.91,"We have raised that issue at every level, Your Honor."
1988.88-605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.1,727.532,Could I interrupt for a minute?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,730.834,731.836,--There are three facts.
1988.88-605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.836,740.581,"And there is a good deal of evidence that that is, number one, useless information and, number two, very difficult to find without some risk to the pregnant woman."
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,740.581,747.446,"Your Honor, there are three factors and lung maturity is one of them: gestational age, fetal weight and lung maturity."
1988.88-605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.814,803.307,It doesn't make such findings to the extent they are necessary.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,807.06,826.103,"We believe, we believe it clearly is a common sense reading of this, a common sense construction, to say that if a test would not demonstrate anything, it would not be in the normal standard of care which this statute in the section which remains upheld imposes on that physician."
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.787,862.009,Let me be sure I understand.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,866.473,876.349,"We are contending, Your Honor, that if that test would not be dispositive, if it wouldn't tell them anything by definition, it cannot be a necessary test."
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.349,879.9,What if he has determined fetal age without determining weight?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,881.473,882.364,We have only--
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.364,883.693,How do you distinguish weight and lungs?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,883.693,892.289,--We believe these are three relevant objective medical findings that should be recorded.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.289,895.232,"I am assuming the doctor who makes a determination, doesn't think the second or third tests are necessary."
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,896.624,905.51,"Well, this statute would require them to make findings, not necessarily record tests but make findings, and the language in the lower court--"
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.51,906.862,You have to make findings on the lung too?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,906.862,910.675,--The language of the lower court in the testimony--
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,910.675,912.967,What is your view on what the statute means?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,912.967,922.743,"--My view, first of all, is that the ultrasound technology which was discussed at the lower court can make a finding for both gestational age and fetal weight."
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.743,922.923,I understand that.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,930.179,930.389,No.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.389,931.551,On neither?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,931.551,937.625,I don't believe that it requires an unnecessary test.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.366,953.908,Say they make the determination that it is not viable?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,953.908,958.159,"Then I believe it would be appropriate, given the state--"
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.159,958.339,Not whether it's appropriate.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,960.581,963.904,--I believe the statute would require them to go forward.
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.904,965.313,With all three tests?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,965.313,970.458,"At least with the next test to determine whether or not the fetus is viable, yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.458,972.309,How about with the third test?
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,972.309,977.732,"If the first two tests don't indicate viability, they would need to, and if there was some indication--"
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,977.732,984.427,The woman appears to be more than 20 weeks into the pregnancy.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,987.7,990.501,--Only if in his ordinary skill and care he has--
1988.88-605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.501,991.332,He thinks it is not necessary.
1988.88-605,0,46516,william_l_webster,,995.384,1000.749,--I don't believe the statute requires the physician to perform any tests that would be unnecessary.
1988.88-605,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1037.161,1039.492,"Very well, General Webster."
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1040.292,1053.921,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1988.88-605,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1131.795,1138.36,"Your position, Mr. Fried, then is that Griswold versus Connecticut is correct and should be retained?"
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1138.36,1140.431,"Exactly, yes it is, Your Honor."
1988.88-605,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1140.431,1144.565,Is that because there is a fundamental right involved in that case?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1144.565,1158.513,"In Griswold against Connecticut, there was a right which was well established in a whole fabric of quite concrete matters, quite concrete."
1988.88-605,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.749,1186.085,Does the case stand for the proposition that there is a right to determine whether to procreate?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1186.085,1189.676,Griswold surely does not stand for that proposition.
1988.88-605,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1189.676,1191.619,What is the right involved in Griswold?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1191.619,1192.44,I beg your pardon?
1988.88-605,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1192.44,1194.142,What is the right involved in Griswold?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1194.142,1210.192,"The right involved in Griswold as the court clearly stated was the right not to have the state intrude into, in a very violent way, into the details, inquire into the details of marital intimacy."
1988.88-605,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1217.858,1223.401,Do you say there is no fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or not?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1223.401,1225.953,I think that that question--
1988.88-605,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.953,1226.544,A right to procreate?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1230.427,1244.886,--I would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract terms and I think the Court prior to Roe v. Wade quite prudently also avoided such sweeping generalities.
1988.88-605,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1247.237,1261.318,"Do you think that the state has the right to, if in a future century we had a serious overpopulation problem, has a right to require women to have abortions after so many children?"
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1261.318,1261.869,I surely do not.
1988.88-605,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.351,1265.232,What do you rest that on?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1265.232,1284.637,"Because unlike abortion, which involves the purposeful termination of future life, that would involve not preventing an operation, but violently taking hands on, laying hands on a woman and submitting her to an operation and a whole constellation--"
1988.88-605,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1284.637,1287.218,And you would rest that on substantive due process protection?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1287.218,1287.507,--Absolutely.
1988.88-605,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1287.507,1291.72,How do you define the liberty interests of the woman in that connection?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1291.72,1297.034,The liberty interest against a seizure would be involved.
1988.88-605,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.412,1312.946,How do you define the interest... the liberty interest of a woman in an abortion case?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1312.946,1336.851,"Well, I would think that there are liberty interests involved in terms perhaps of the contraceptive interest, but there is an interest at all points, however the interest of the woman is defined, at all points it is an interest which is matched by the state's interest in potential life."
1988.88-605,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.851,1339.032,I understand it is matched but I want to know how you define it?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1339.032,1350.321,I would define it in terms of the concrete impositions on the woman which so offended the court in Griswold and which are not present in the Roe situation.
1988.88-605,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1376.988,1386.365,"Mr. Fried do I correctly read what your brief says at page 12, footnote 9, that Griswold is a Fourth Amendment case?"
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1386.365,1387.767,"--Is, I beg your pardon?"
1988.88-605,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1387.767,1389.146,Is a Fourth Amendment case?
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1389.146,1394.041,It is a case which draws on the Fourth Amendment.
1988.88-605,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.367,1471.372,"Mr. Fried, is there a difference between the court's power in the case of an abortion that would be life threatening to the woman and an abortion that would merely cause her severe and prolonged disease?"
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1473.733,1498.459,"--I think that is a matter of degree and it is perfectly clear that severe health effects shade over into a threat to the life and I cannot promise the court that our submission would dispense the Federal courts from considering matters like that, but I also very much doubt that the Court would be presented with many such situations."
1988.88-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.783,1532.093,"Does your submission suggest that a public hospital, in a state that permits abortion, could not allow abortions?"
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1532.093,1547.162,"It is quite clear that a public hospital may under this court's decision in Maher and in Harris and McRae, may do as Missouri has here done and say that public funds cannot be expended."
1988.88-605,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.162,1554.819,Suppose there is a state that permits abortions and they are done in public hospitals.
1988.88-605,1,18942,charles_fried,,1569.428,1570.848,"Oh, no, I think there is not."
1988.88-605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.696,1627.636,Thank you Mr. Fried.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,1628.888,1646.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court, I think the Solicitor General's submission is somewhat disingenuous when he suggests to this court that he does not seek to unravel the whole cloth of procreational rights, but merely to pull a thread."
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.581,1696.804,"Excuse me, you find it hare to draw a line between those two but easy to draw a line between first, second and third trimester."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,1696.804,1699.076,I do not find it difficult--
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.076,1706.982,I don't see why a court that can draw that line can't separate abortion from birth control quite readily?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,1706.982,1710.796,"--If I may suggest the reasons in response to your question, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.085,1779.204,"Do you agree that the state can forbid abortions save to preserve the life of the mother after the fetus is, say, eight months old?"
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,1779.204,1791.78,"If I understand the question, Justice Kennedy, I think the health rights of the woman always are supreme at any stage of pregnancy."
1988.88-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1791.78,1795.954,Suppose the health rights of the mother are not involved?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,1805.881,1816.66,"Yes, I am willing to recognize the compelling interest granted in Roe of the state in potential fetal life after the point of viability."
1988.88-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1816.66,1819.781,"But that is a line drawing, isn't it?"
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,1819.781,1821.01,"Yes, it is."
1988.88-605,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1846.309,1849.201,"Well there is a difference, is there not in those two?"
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,1849.201,1851.162,"Technically between those two definitions, Justice O'Connor, yes."
1988.88-605,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1857.565,1860.329,When the fetus was first felt by the mother?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,1860.329,1867.863,"A kick, yes, absolutely, approximately two or three weeks before what we would consider viability today."
1988.88-605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.357,2075.443,"It is a deeply rooted tradition, but surely abortion was regulated by the states in the 19th century and in the 20th century?"
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2075.443,2084.271,"Yes, but I think it is necessary to go back and examine, as the historical brief does and other works, as to the reasons those regulations were enacted."
1988.88-605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.476,2100.371,"If you say there is a deeply rooted tradition of freedom in this area, that suggests that there had been no legislative intervention to me."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2103.241,2113.769,"--I think we can look to a deeply rooted tradition as opposed to black and white issues, as opposed to slavery and yet we have much legislation."
1988.88-605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.969,2133.482,I am not talking about legislation post-Roe against Wade.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2148.093,2153.437,--Because I think you have to examine the period before the regulations came into effect.
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.838,2171.139,That certainly is not uncontested.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2189.952,2190.482,I think--
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.482,2197.506,And also contradicting your contention that the whole purpose was to protect the mother and not to protect the fetus.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2197.506,2199.729,--I understand there are briefs on both sides.
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.668,2243.83,But these briefs cite cases and they give quotations.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2259.121,2264.236,"Justice Scalia, I would not submit that the briefs do not disagree with each other."
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.665,2290.292,"Let me inquire... I can see deriving a fundamental right from either a long tradition that this, the right to abort, has always been protected."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2327.177,2340.826,"I think the basic question, and of course it goes to one of the specific provisions of the statute as to whether this is a human life or whether human life begins at conception, is not something that is verifiable as a fact."
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.113,2373.126,"I agree with you entirely, but what conclusion does that lead you to?"
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2388.046,2408.301,"The conclusion to which it leads me is that when you have an issue that is so divisive and so emotional and so personal and so intimate, that it must be left as a fundamental right to the individual to make that choice under her then attendant circumstances, her religious beliefs, her moral beliefs and in consultation with her physician."
1988.88-605,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2548.124,2554.19,"Mr. Susman, I guess the states courts never had a chance to interpret their own state statute."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2554.19,2554.219,No.
1988.88-605,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2554.219,2560.214,And I guess the statute is subject to a narrowing construction.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2560.214,2570.129,I think any statute is always subject to a narrowing construction depending how far one wants to perhaps distort the language that is there.
1988.88-605,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2602.881,2609.155,"I thought there should typically try to be a construction that would avoid constitutional difficulties, not encourage them."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2609.155,2617.282,"I absolutely agree with that principle, but then what you always have is just how far do you bend over backwards to accommodate that principle?"
1988.88-605,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.988,2634.113,"To whom is this admonition directed, no public funds shall be spent to--"
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2634.113,2635.304,No public funds shall be expended.
1988.88-605,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.304,2637.887,--Who is that directed to?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2637.887,2653.426,"I have to assume and in my opinion because certainly the answer is not clear, that it is to everyone associated, every public official, every public facility, who in any way handles and deals with public funds."
1988.88-605,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.062,2668.987,"And I suppose it includes any employee in a public hospital that is being paid by public funds, I suppose."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2668.987,2670.069,Absolutely in my opinion.
1988.88-605,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.069,2670.51,Including doctors.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2670.51,2670.99,Right.
1988.88-605,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.984,2693.795,"Mr. Susman, let me interrupt you there."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2708.657,2722.266,"--Yes, because I think Justice Kennedy hit the nail on the head clearly in my mind, that were a physician to violate the proscription of this section and being a publicly paid employee, he would necessarily be discharged."
1988.88-605,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.266,2726.456,It does not even apply to a physician if I understand your opponent's submission.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2746.842,2756.877,"If his interpretation is correct, then I think it remains almost a total mystery as to what this section does mean or how it will be applied."
1988.88-605,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.877,2761.301,It just applies to fiscal officers who are drafting programs on how to spend state money.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2768.484,2775.84,"I would agree, but when I read the section and I read the two that follow, that's not what it says to me."
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.892,2788.78,I presume in order to comply with the section a fiscal officer when he approves a program has to make sure that there are directives issued that people won't give advice on abortion.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2788.78,2790.122,That is a different question.
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2790.122,2793.695,Can he possibly be complying with this program unless he issues such a directive?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2800.349,2801.259,Absolutely.
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.259,2803.122,I can't imagine that it wouldn't.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2803.122,2805.032,I agree 100 percent.
1988.88-605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.539,2816.989,"If there are no criminal sanctions, why does vagueness apply?"
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2816.989,2818.071,--I think it applies for two reasons.
1988.88-605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2818.071,2820.672,What is the authority from this court?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2820.672,2823.825,I think the fact that there is a heightened standard because it touches upon--
1988.88-605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2823.825,2825.477,What case authority?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2825.477,2834.072,"--In all candor, I am having a block."
1988.88-605,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.705,2843.789,That would be a common situation in trying to answer that question.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2843.789,2846.781,--I understand that and I apologize.
1988.88-605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2870.707,2874.568,Did they cite a case from this court for that proposition?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,2878.241,2878.571,If I may.
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.577,2990.506,"He could give the advice, he could tell the patient up front, I am not permitted because I have this directive that comes from the officer that dispenses the money, I am not permitted to advise that you have an abortion."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3009.119,3009.91,--I--
1988.88-605,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.91,3012.281,Because my freedom to do so has been abridged by this statute.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3013.894,3030.925,"--I think the suggestion that the physician say to the woman who has been coming to years to this established health care system, to this physician, to this hospital, now you must go elsewhere because the state tells me I can't talk about it, is a new obstacle."
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.049,3041.344,"Why is it any different from the physician who says to the woman who is his long time client at this hospital, you need an abortion."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3047.096,3051.381,"No, I do not believe so, because I think that creates an obstacle that did not previously exist."
1988.88-605,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.381,3057.564,Have we not upheld the withholding of funding for public money for abortion?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3057.564,3063.388,"I cannot in my mind compare this with the withholding of funding which created as this court said repeatedly, no new obstacle."
1988.88-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3186.46,3190.654,Are those first three options ones on which reasonable people could disagree?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3190.654,3196.779,"Yes, but I think even on the fourth option."
1988.88-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3198.408,3211.358,Do you have any authority in our jurisprudence other than the cases following from Roe versus Wade that tells a state it cannot adopt a proposition that reasonable people agree with?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3211.358,3216.631,"No, but I think the problem here is that the--"
1988.88-605,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3216.631,3218.985,So this is unique to Roe?
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3218.985,3220.373,--I think this is somewhat unique.
1988.88-605,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.355,3313.278,"Mr. Susman, if it doesn't serve any purpose, what harm does it do?"
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3313.278,3320.03,"Because I am not totally convinced it serves no purpose, as the Solicitor General was not totally convinced."
1988.88-605,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3345.336,3346.627,I know about that.
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3349.238,3353.161,It is only an example of how it can be used.
1988.88-605,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.161,3356.965,"Yeah, it might be used in a tort action against a street car company."
1988.88-605,2,24566,frank_susman,,3356.965,3359.246,It would be used to prevent in vitro fertilization.
1988.88-605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3361.186,3364.88,Thank you Mr. Susman.
1988.88-605,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3368.773,3395.64,"While you are getting ready, General Webster, I would like you to answer Justice Scalia's question whether in the funding provision, the funding officer would have a duty to promulgate regulations that would prevent a doctor, a state employee from performing abortions and the like."
1988.88-605,3,46516,william_l_webster,,3398.572,3422.369,"Turning first to your question, Your Honor, we have suggested all along that the language relating to funding only directs and only goes to those officers of public funding."
1988.88-605,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3464.302,3479.163,But he makes the very good point that it is impossible to distinguish between abortion and contraception when you define abortion as the destruction of the first joinder of the ovum and the sperm.
1988.88-605,3,46516,william_l_webster,,3479.163,3483.137,"--Your Honor, and it may well be appropriate for this court to review that question at some point."
1988.88-605,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3499.92,3509.886,"Before the court on the question of whether, as the Solicitor General argues, you can overrule Roe versus Wade without endangering our law concerning contraception."
1988.88-605,3,46516,william_l_webster,,3509.886,3523.445,"We think overruling Roe versus Wade and going to a different standard, whether it is a rational basis standard, an undue burden standard, would not affect contraception or that threshold question in the State of Missouri."
1988.88-605,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3523.445,3530.578,But the preamble would make your prohibition against abortions in public facilities apply to things like installing an IUD and that sort of thing.
1988.88-605,3,46516,william_l_webster,,3530.578,3533.781,"Your Honor, we would contend that is not the case."
1988.88-605,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3549.251,3555.465,"The language about performing or counseling about abortions doesn't only talk about post-viability abortions, does it?"
1988.88-605,3,46516,william_l_webster,,3555.465,3561.189,"--Your Honor, yes, there is a specific statute and it only prohibits abortions in a post-viability setting."
1988.88-605,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3561.189,3563.37,"No, no, no, that's not my question."
1988.88-605,3,46516,william_l_webster,,3576.63,3578.132,As far as public--
1988.88-605,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3578.132,3579.652,"Yes, public funding."
1988.88-605,3,46516,william_l_webster,,3579.652,3581.174,--As far as public funding is concerned.
1988.88-605,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3581.174,3583.015,So it does relate to the very issues in this case.
1988.88-605,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3583.015,3586.147,"Thank you, Mr. Webster."
