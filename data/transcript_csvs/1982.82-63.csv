1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.92,We will arguments next in the City of Revere against Massachusetts General Hospital.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,51.011,58.556,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,116.422,125.106,"That is when the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts said he was under arrest, since that bullet hit him."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,125.106,134.79,"Yes, Your Honor, except that the Revere police secured an arrest warrant from the Chelsea District Court, the local court of appropriate jurisdiction."
1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,134.79,137.477,Later on.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,137.477,142.882,"Later on, after... while Mr. Kivlin was still in the hospital."
1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,142.882,147.864,"When they picked him up off the street to take him to the hospital, was he arrested then?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,147.864,157.531,"We would submit that he was not, other than in the practical sense that he was incapacitated and could not move away on his own."
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,185.115,190.284,Does the record show why they took him to MGH rather than Boston City?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,190.284,196.673,"It does not, Your Honor, except that geographically Massachusetts General Hospital is closer."
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,196.673,197.187,Much?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,199.28,206.48,"It depends upon the time of day, but I believe that as a matter of course--"
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,206.48,209.151,Does the time of day make the distance--
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,209.151,213.415,"--In terms of traffic conditions at the scene, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,213.415,216.101,--But at least Boston City was a municipal hospital.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,218.24,219.944,"Yes, that is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,219.944,225.161,"What was the reason for taking him to MGH, other than closeness in terms of traffic?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,225.161,229.05,"I would think no other, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,236.032,243.983,The result is that you are imposing this cost on a private hospital in contrast to imposing it on a municipal hospital.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,243.983,251.807,"We are not claiming in this litigation, Your Honor, that it is the private hospital that must bear this burden."
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,262.943,265.02,Aren't you weaseling the words there?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,268.956,283.123,"--The decision of who pays is necessarily a legislative one, and properly belongs with the legislature or the Congress and not the courts, at least under the circumstances of this particular case."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,283.123,285.185,May I ask this question.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,298.21,302.584,"No, Your Honor, I would not contend that--"
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.584,309.753,"What Federal obligation, if any, did they have to the man before they picked him up and took him to the hospital?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,309.753,323.029,"--I believe that the police officers had the obligation to call the ambulance, to provide him with access to emergency medical attention."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,323.029,324.763,As a matter of Federal constitutional law?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,324.763,327.668,"Yes, because I believe--"
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,327.668,332.056,"What if when the ambulance driver picked him up and took him to the hospital, the hospital said:"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,335.96,342.77,--Then that is not a deprivation of rights that Revere has visited on--
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,342.77,351.689,"But if that had happened... If that had happened, would the City of Revere had any further Federal constitutional obligation at that point in time?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,351.689,353.0,"--I believe not, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,353.0,354.641,Not even to take him to some other hospital?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,354.641,356.969,I do not believe so.
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,356.969,364.746,"You say that they have the obligation to pick him up and put him in an ambulance, but they don't have any obligation to make sure that the ambulance gets any place that will do him any good."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,366.604,372.213,"The reason, I would submit, Your Honor, is out of the negative."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.112,398.109,Could one not say precisely the same thing about leaving him in an ambulance unattended in a parking lot of a hospital?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,398.109,413.588,"No, because as a practical matter the ambulance... the ambulance driver doesn't simply leave him there, and really the threat that you speak of is simply a hypothetical one."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.588,414.087,Yes.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,426.332,426.832,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.832,436.703,"But if he continues to suffer pain in the ambulance and there is no doctor around to alleviate that pain, does their duty terminate, or do they have a continuing duty until they find somebody who will take care of him."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,437.701,449.541,"I do not believe the duty is continuing, but it is a fact pattern that is not presented in this case as being--"
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,449.541,450.119,What is the duty?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,450.119,453.212,--The duty is--
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,453.212,455.087,"You say that it is not continuing duty, but what is it?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,455.087,460.491,--The duty is not to deny him access to medical attention.
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,460.491,462.786,You say that that is not continuing?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,462.786,471.596,It is simply not to inflict punishment on him by refusing to--
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,471.596,483.137,"Then when he is carried to the hospital, and he sits out there and the hospital won't take him, and they put him out in the grounds and they leave him there; is that the end of the duty?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,483.137,490.291,--I do not believe that the city has a continuing obligation at that stage.
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,490.291,493.57,I think you have bit off a little more than you are going to be able to chew.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,511.282,522.917,"That danger is really a hypothetical one, and as demonstrated in the facts of this particular case, the hospital will not simply turn the people away."
1982.82-63,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,527.479,532.289,"They had no guarantee they would be paid when this person was dumped at their door, did they?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,532.289,533.945,They had no guarantee whatsoever.
1982.82-63,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.945,535.241,They still took him.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,535.241,551.579,"Nonetheless, they took him, and what's more under the facts of the case, they took him a second time fully a week after the Chief of the Revere Police Department notified them that Revere had no intention of paying this particular bill."
1982.82-63,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.579,560.387,"Are there any Federal or State laws that require private general hospitals open to the public to take emergency cases, counsel?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,560.387,574.522,There is an express law in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by statute which provides that any hospital with an emergency wing must provide emergency medical care to all those who need it.
1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,592.094,595.42,"Is this hospital a tax-exempt organization, do you know?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,595.42,600.871,"Massachusetts General Hospital is a non-profit organization, and if you look--"
1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.871,613.553,"There is some sort of a quid pro quo in your intimation that if you have got that kind of benefit, you take on some burdens like emergency treatment."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,613.553,625.987,"--Necessarily, when the hospital opens its doors and says to the public that it has an emergency wing, it must necessarily provide the emergency services that are required."
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,657.458,659.442,Why should Boston City accept him?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,659.442,664.033,Because Boston City is a publicly supported institution.
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,664.033,665.158,But it isn't a Revere hospital.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,668.187,672.202,But it is obligated to accept--
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,672.202,679.667,"It is fine for you to say that MGH should take care of the emergency, and then what, put him on the street?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,682.963,691.584,"--Boston City is under an obligation, as are publicly supported hospitals, to treat those in need."
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,691.584,694.801,"The emergency rooms... Why couldn't MGH say,"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,704.954,707.781,Because State law says--
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,707.781,711.233,"Suppose you had no such State law, then what?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,711.233,714.545,--I think there is a common law obligation.
1982.82-63,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,714.545,725.696,"What your argument implies, I am not saying it's wrong, is that maybe MGH should close its emergency wing."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,725.696,740.408,"If it sought to avoid the outcome in this case, and if its appeals to the legislature to do something with regard to the specific facts of this case we are unveiling, that might well be their alternative."
1982.82-63,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,740.408,752.216,Don't hospitals accepting Medicare or federally funded patients have a requirement to provide certain emergency services?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,760.558,762.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,783.657,793.418,Let me try another hypothetical on you addressed at testing the Massachusetts Court's theory about arrest as soon as this fellow was hit with a bullet.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,811.473,834.059,"In that situation, assuming that the individual did not have a State law tort remedy against the individual officer, so that assuming that there is no fault, as there is no indication in this case that there was any fault on the part of the Revere police, the hospital is left in the identical situation."
1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.447,847.21,Then this fanciful theory about being arrested when the bullet hit him is irrelevant in your view to the case?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,847.21,855.362,"In my view, it is irrelevant and ought not to be viewed as dispositive by this Court."
1982.82-63,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.148,1202.754,"Mr. Zaleznik, are we in a position to impose our rules as to standing on the highest court of the State?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1202.754,1221.591,"In this circumstance, in the context of this case, Your Honor, this Court is free to judge by Federal rules of standing, since it is clear in the court's footnote in the opinion below that it was applying Federal laws of standing."
1982.82-63,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1239.646,1243.145,Which footnote is it that you rely on for that?
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1243.145,1252.485,This is footnote No. 7 on pages 26 and 27 of the record appendix.
1982.82-63,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.485,1253.328,Thank you.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1253.328,1260.138,The citations are to the Barrows case and to a treatise on the Federal Courts by Professor Wright.
1982.82-63,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.138,1267.885,"Of course, they also say in that footnote that there was no standing question raised or argued in the briefs and they deem it waived."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1267.885,1273.679,"Yes, Your Honor, but nonetheless submit that the issue is properly before the Court."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.474,1357.238,Let me ask you a question about that.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1388.757,1393.567,"My argument is not an Article 3 argument, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.567,1398.846,"Well, but even if it is prudential, you are saying, as a matter of our own prudential rule, we should not address the matter."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1398.846,1400.439,"Yes, but--"
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.439,1408.312,"Isn't that like saying that, in effect, the Massachusetts Court has given an advisory opinion on a Federal constitutional question?"
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1408.312,1414.09,"--In the context of this particular case, it was not an advisory opinion, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1428.912,1444.11,"Supposing the State had a procedure whereby its Supreme Court could render advisory opinions, and they were asked to render an advisory opinion on this very issue."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1452.341,1461.353,"That is correct, Your Honor, but in this circumstance the issue of standing was heard and determined as a matter of Federal law."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.353,1461.759,Right.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1470.739,1476.284,"At that point, I believe the judgment should be reversed."
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.284,1477.191,At least he is right.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1477.191,1486.75,My only disagreement is whether or not there should be a remand at that particular stage to the Supreme Judicial Court.
1982.82-63,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.81,1494.543,But you are telling me that they decided two issues of Federal law.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1497.526,1503.382,"--Yes, Your Honor, but they decided standing simply as a matter of Federal law."
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1507.491,1511.191,It is sort of pendant jurisdiction.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1511.191,1511.816,Excuse me.
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1511.816,1513.504,Sort of a pendant jurisdiction.
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1513.504,1518.361,But it was not raised at any point in the proceeding--
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1518.361,1519.985,"If it wasn't raised, it is not here."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1519.985,1527.592,--I agree that the only issue before this Court--
1982.82-63,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1527.592,1542.149,"It wasn't raised, and the Massachusetts Supreme Court just went completely off, what, base, and decided a Federal question which they had no right to decide, either one of them."
1982.82-63,0,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,1554.066,1563.576,"--They had the right to decide, but we believe that they decided in both circumstances in an erroneous fashion."
1982.82-63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.223,1626.41,Mr. Broad.
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,1626.41,1636.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.82-63,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1690.822,1697.039,"But your point contends, as I understand it, Mr. Broad, that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court didn't do that."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,1703.13,1714.017,"I think in order to determine what the court in fact did, Justice Rehnquist, we might look very closely at that footnote 7 on page 26 of the Appendix to which my Brother has already referred."
1982.82-63,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.659,1791.374,We have to get out the Blue Book of citations to decide whether there is an adequate and independent State--
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,1791.374,1801.199,"--I suggest that what the Court has done is decided it as a matter of State law, Your Honor, pointing out in passing, and this is not so uncommon for a State court--"
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1801.199,1803.542,--Which State law were they passing on?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,1803.542,1806.884,"--The waiver question, Your Honor, as a matter of State law."
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1806.884,1809.509,Which State law?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,1809.509,1814.757,"Whether as a matter of State law, the question of standing can be waived."
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1814.757,1820.27,"You said they were passing on State law, and I am asking you which State law."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,1820.27,1822.44,"I am not saying, Your Honor, a State statute."
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.502,1827.283,Common law?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,1827.283,1829.735,It is in part common law.
1982.82-63,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.267,1872.389,What makes you think that that is parting company with the Federal rule?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,1872.389,1884.055,"Perhaps I have over-spoken, Your Honor, and it is certainly not essential to my argument that that would be parting company, just that it is clearly presented here in the first paragraph solely as a State law issue."
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.681,2043.819,Is the City of Revere overloaded with money?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2043.819,2044.944,--Overloaded with money?
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.944,2045.241,Is it?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2045.241,2046.319,I don't know the answer.
1982.82-63,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.719,2068.7,"First we have to know if there is an obligation to shift, don't we?"
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2068.7,2070.262,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.058,2114.37,"Are you talking now, Mr. Broad, about a Federal constitutional obligation?"
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2114.37,2116.463,A Federal constitutional obligation.
1982.82-63,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.688,2153.699,Perhaps questions from the Bench have side-tracked you from what I thought was your argument that this is basically a State law ground ultimately that the Supreme Judicial Court has taken.
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2160.462,2165.288,"I think Your Honor understands my argument correctly and has stated it, in fact, quite well."
1982.82-63,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.936,2192.183,"But you are here to defend an opinion of the State Supreme Court, the highest court, that there is a Federal basis for the obligation, a."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2197.275,2199.837,That is not how I would read the opinion.
1982.82-63,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2199.837,2203.726,What is the Eighth Amendment discussion about?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2203.726,2220.437,"I think, Your Honor, that what the State Court did was to fashion a rule to protect an underlying constitutional right, without saying that the particular implementing rule was itself required by the Constitution."
1982.82-63,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2234.135,2263.404,"But wouldn't you think, if it were an implementing rule that is State-based, assuming that the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts know how to write opinions as well as everyone else, that that would have appeared in the first part of the opinion, where you are talking about various State law bases for recovery, not as your opponent has quoted, the first two sentences of the section called 5a, where they say,"
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2280.007,2283.989,"The transition there, Your Honor, I agree, may be a bit choppy."
1982.82-63,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2364.269,2378.265,"Why couldn't the Court have simply said that when a policeman, who is not a Federal officer in Massachusetts, shoots anyone there is an obligation to take care of their own."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2381.107,2382.747,That would be.
1982.82-63,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.747,2388.728,"It wouldn't be any of our business by which gyrations they arrived at that conclusion, would it?"
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2388.728,2390.946,But it could be put as a matter of State law.
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.288,2448.313,"What about the Chief Justice's earlier question that he missed the culprit and shot an innocent bystander, the same policeman, Revere wouldn't be responsible for that bill, would it?"
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2448.313,2454.577,There is no underlying constitutional obligation to provide care for an innocent bystander.
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2457.56,2460.7,So the thug gets protection and an ordinary citizen doesn't get it.
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2460.7,2464.464,"--Generally, Your Honor, when a person is in custody--"
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.464,2467.509,"It may be in general, but that is not normal."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2467.509,2469.211,"--Your Honor, I suggest--"
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.211,2470.242,That is not generally held.
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2470.242,2485.923,"--In Harris v. McCrea, this Court very clearly held that the government does not in general have an obligation to provide funding to allow its citizens to exercise what may otherwise be their constitutional rights."
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.365,2513.412,But tell me what your argument is.
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2523.735,2524.407,That is correct.
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2524.407,2529.78,"Not a Federal Court decision, which is the point we have been trying to get through to you."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2529.78,2531.264,"I suggest that anything, Your Honor--"
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2531.264,2533.17,You say that it is no different.
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2533.17,2540.698,"--I suggest, if anything, the State court ought to have greater deference and greater opportunity to fashion the rule than a Federal Court would."
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2550.615,2553.676,"You had better stick to this one, and not try to decide other ones."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2553.676,2565.375,"I think that would be the case if it were a Federal Court decision, because the Federal Court would have had to limit carefully its intrusion into State affairs."
1982.82-63,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.264,2579.979,"Mr. Broad, may I ask you a question about the opinion that begins the Eighth Amendment discussion and has the footnote 7 about waiver in it, and then they say, ""We agree""."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2603.517,2609.638,"I was not trial counsel, Your Honor, so I don't know what happened at that argument in the case."
1982.82-63,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2631.27,2641.86,"But he says the argument was that the Eighth Amendment created a duty to take him to the hospital, but that gave rise an implied contract to pay, and that as of State law you can't have such an implied contract."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2641.86,2648.154,"--That is not stated at least so clearly in the brief, Your Honor, to be able to determine which way it came down."
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.907,2690.684,"That way it stands on a State Court opinion, which gives the State Court the right to decide a Federal standing point."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2690.684,2692.792,"--I suggest, Your Honor, that the Federal--"
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2692.792,2693.402,Doesn't it?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2693.402,2698.54,"--I don't believe, with all respect, that the Federal standing question was decided in this case."
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2702.68,2703.789,But there is a possibility.
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2703.789,2705.819,--That might also be.
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2705.819,2708.271,Should we leave that possibility there?
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2708.271,2717.376,"You might also... If it is unclear to the Court what the basis was for that section of the decision, it might also be remanded under a national--"
1982.82-63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.376,2721.514,"Frankly, it is not unclear to me, but I can only speak for one."
1982.82-63,1,35495,michael_broad,,2721.514,2722.624,--I understand.
1982.82-63,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2921.513,2927.213,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Zaleznik?"
1982.82-63,2,28747,ira_h_zaleznik,,2927.213,2929.822,"Just one point, Your Honor."
1982.82-63,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2979.864,2980.941,"Thank you, gentlemen."
