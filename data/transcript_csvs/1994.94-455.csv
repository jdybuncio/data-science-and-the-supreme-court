1994.94-455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.798,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-455, Tyson Johnson v. Houston Jones."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,54.887,60.692,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.439,101.54,What was the second point again?
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,102.329,103.19,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1994.94-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.036,192.609,You're immune if you're innocent?
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,208.688,213.974,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that we're not saying that we shouldn't be liable here."
1994.94-455,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,220.987,232.705,"No, but isn't... may I ask you if it would be proper to restate your position this way: you're claiming that there should be an immunity from trial if two conditions are met."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,247.424,249.567,"--Essentially that's right, Justice Souter."
1994.94-455,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,250.506,268.367,"You're saying public officials should have a right to interlocutory appeal on summary judgment issues because there is a value in not subjecting them to trial unless there really is a genuine dispute, and they would not be entitled to judgment."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,268.367,268.798,--Well--
1994.94-455,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,268.798,269.348,That's what you're saying.
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,269.348,276.203,--we're saying they have a right to interlocutory appeal when they've moved for summary judgment on the ground that they did not violate clearly established law because they didn't--
1994.94-455,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,276.203,279.845,"No, but that's... you keep bringing in they did not violate clearly established law."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,290.955,295.496,"--Well, I think that's right, but there are two aspects--"
1994.94-455,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,295.496,312.867,And that's a different concept of immunity from the normal qualified immunity concept in which your first concern is that public officials should not have to guess about possible changes in the law or clarifications of the law that occur after they act.
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,327.006,331.129,"--Well, I think there are a number of aspects that are being connected here, Your Honor."
1994.94-455,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,345.9,354.024,"Mr. Rothfeld, maybe I can clarify what the problem seems to be, at least for me, this way."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,366.663,370.586,--That is... that would... theoretically it would be possible in every case.
1994.94-455,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.586,371.175,Not theoretically.
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,386.776,392.819,"On the question of whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant committed a constitutional violation, that is our position, and let me--"
1994.94-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.819,399.143,"That may be a very good rule, but I just question your trying to sneak it in under the name immunity."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,399.143,401.065,"--Well, let me, if I can--"
1994.94-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.065,403.708,It does not bear any resemblance to a doctrine of immunity.
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,408.54,417.716,"--If I can take a step back and try to describe the conceptual framework which I think makes clear what it is that we're asking for, in resolving an immunity claim there are going always to have to be two steps."
1994.94-455,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,464.806,480.578,"It seems to me that immunity is usually used to characterize a situation in which had the official been a private person he would have been liable, but by reason of his official status he is not."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,490.165,519.714,"Well, I think certainly, Justice Kennedy, preventing liability for public officials who acted in a state of legal uncertainty is a purpose of the immunity doctrine, but immunity has considerably broader purposes, and Siegert I think demonstrates clearly that the principle that only officials who did violate the Constitution but did so at a time when it all was in flux, I think that is not the only purpose, but the conclusion in Siegert was that the official defendant was entitled to immunity, because the plaintiff had not made out a violation of the Constitution at all."
1994.94-455,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.261,523.174,"Mr. Rothfeld, wouldn't it be better to stick with this category?"
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,581.654,586.776,"--Well, I think there are several answers to that, Justice O'Connor... Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-455,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,617.468,622.982,So you don't think that trial judges on the whole have a better feel for facts than courts of appeal judges?
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,622.982,631.677,"--No, I don't, but the question here is a legal question of whether or not there is a genuine issue of material fact, and the Court has recognized repeatedly that is a question of law."
1994.94-455,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.317,639.611,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, this... my question ties in with that of Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,703.344,707.225,"--Well, I think, to the contrary let me make two points in response to that."
1994.94-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.197,744.849,Maybe we should extend that to everybody in 1983 cases.
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,752.235,772.959,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, we should not depart from the basic principle that the Court has stated repeatedly in its immunity decisions in Harlow and in Anderson and in Mitchell, over and over, that the point of the immunity doctrine, the fundamental purpose, is to prevent the trial of insubstantial claims because of all the familiar reasons that insubstantial suits against innocent public officials, because of the burdens that those impose on the political system and the court."
1994.94-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.959,784.336,"That is the purpose of the immunity doctrine, but it does not follow that everything that deters or prevents the trial of insubstantial claims is immunity."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,784.336,785.998,"No, that--"
1994.94-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.998,795.372,"Your equating it with the immunity doctrine simply because this new device would happen to achieve the same end, it would, but it seems to me new law--"
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,795.372,796.403,"--Well, I'm using, Your Honor--"
1994.94-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.403,797.755,--and not the immunity doctrine at all.
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,797.755,806.441,"--I'm using the court's definition of immunity, which is that it protects all public officials who did not violate clearly established law, which necessarily, as I say, includes officials who didn't violate the law at all."
1994.94-455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,807.55,811.775,"But immunity... to my mind, it's a defense."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,827.964,835.659,"--Well, again, as in Siegert, Mr. Chief Justice, the Court concluded that the first step was to determine whether or not there had been a violation of the law."
1994.94-455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.659,838.231,"In Siegert, there was no dispute about the facts."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,838.231,839.253,That's true.
1994.94-455,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,839.253,845.315,We didn't take that to reevaluate the factual conclusions or the summary judgment conclusions of the lower courts.
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,845.315,866.74,"That's true, and if it is... if we accept the proposition that there is an immunity defense stated when there has been no violation of law at all because then there necessarily hasn't been a violation of clearly established law, you're led to the question of, does the existence of the factual dispute somehow preclude the appeal of that issue, and again, the court has to make some assumption about what the defendant did so that it can apply to clearly established law."
1994.94-455,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,929.601,938.627,"Mr. Rothfeld, I still think that the clearly established law is coming into this case when it really doesn't fit."
1994.94-455,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,963.682,975.249,"--No, certainly Harlow doesn't resolve the question here, but Harlow sets the framework of what is it that determines whether a defendant should be accorded liability, and as we say, the formulation of Harlow has been repeated in all of these Court's cases."
1994.94-455,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.66,989.2,Just in time.
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,994.273,1012.335,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.654,1077.558,May I ask if your position would also lead to allowing appeals in these cases from denials of motion to dismiss for legal insufficiency?
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1077.558,1078.058,I think it would.
1994.94-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.058,1078.85,Yes.
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1078.85,1084.202,"I think it would, Your Honor, and that's because the same interests would be served in those cases, which is when--"
1994.94-455,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.202,1093.298,Basically any interlocutory... any order we used to think of as interlocutory would be appealable by the defendant in a 1983 case if he could say there really isn't much basis for this suit.
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1093.298,1107.989,"--I would say that all you would have to decide to rule for petitioners in this case is whether a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) or under Rule 56 that included an assertion that the official did not violate clear law, and so it might not apply."
1994.94-455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1109.759,1110.53,"How about, did not violate any law?"
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1112.433,1120.336,"--That would be included, and the distinction that I was trying to make is that there might be dispositive defenses, but that would be statute of limitations or something--"
1994.94-455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1120.336,1121.077,Where do you get this out of?
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1132.915,1149.656,"--Well, I think the key question in responding to whether Cohen applies, again, is whether there is a reason to recognize here a right not to be tried, and in Mitchell the Court found that the Cchen factors, including the separability factor, was easily met there because there was a right not to be tried there."
1994.94-455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1160.021,1169.218,"It seems that would take Cohen totally away from what its purpose was, something that was not tied in with the merits."
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1171.411,1179.215,--The issue in Cohen was whether a denial of a motion for security for counsel fees was--
1994.94-455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1179.215,1179.906,Security for costs?
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1179.906,1180.717,"--Right, could be--"
1994.94-455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.717,1183.687,It had nothing to do with the merits of the litigation.
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1183.687,1184.859,"--That's right, and there is moreover--"
1994.94-455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1184.859,1187.019,This has everything to do with the merits of the litigation.
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1187.019,1197.498,"--You're exactly right that there's more overlap here, and I think under Mitchell, where the right not to be tried is at stake, more close association with the merits is tolerated."
1994.94-455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1271.566,1283.244,"Ms. Pillard, I thought that Harlow was a case concerned with motive, and it said it didn't want the judges to be exploring what's in the head of the public officer."
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1291.788,1301.566,"--That's right, and my point was really on a slightly more general level, that the notion of taking what doesn't require a jury trial."
1994.94-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1334.485,1349.616,"It seems to me if we adopt your position that one way to curtail the number of appeals would be to say in another case, and the dispute has yet to be resolved, that there can be only one interlocutory appeal."
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1351.048,1358.082,"Well, I'm aware that that's an issue on which the Court has granted certiorari, and that is one of the mechanisms that the courts of appeals have explored."
1994.94-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1358.082,1371.531,"Would you agree with that position, because everything you have said about protecting the officer seems to me to indicate that you would allow multiple appeals if new affidavits, or new evidence was adduced after a summary judgment disposition the first go-around."
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1371.531,1383.268,"I think a rule restricting to one in every case might be too rigid, but I think there is an interest in finality that might... adherent in the Cohen finality doctrine might be some kind of limitation--"
1994.94-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1383.268,1384.839,So you're telling us--
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1384.839,1385.64,--on the number of appeals.
1994.94-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1385.64,1393.925,"--So you're telling us that there can be a motion, an interlocutory appeal in every summary judgment case, and that they can be multiple."
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1393.925,1397.588,There may be cases in which multiple appeals would be appropriate.
1994.94-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.588,1404.052,"Well, all right, then, then it doesn't... I mean, you're asking, I think... you cut the doctrine loose from its mooring in Cohen."
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1482.042,1490.22,"Well, I think under Anderson v. Liberty Lobby that the court of appeals would be in a proper position to affirm the district court's decision to go ahead and let that--"
1994.94-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1490.22,1490.58,Why?
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1490.58,1491.448,--mess go to trial.
1994.94-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1491.448,1491.748,Why?
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1492.269,1494.22,For the same reason the district court applied Rule 56--
1994.94-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1494.22,1494.54,You'd have--
1994.94-455,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1494.54,1494.991,--that way.
1994.94-455,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.761,1570.899,"--Thank you, Ms. Pillard."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,1572.992,1584.441,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may xx please the Court:"
1994.94-455,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1681.994,1684.516,"Well, why not, Mr. Proctor?"
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,1703.377,1705.079,Okay.
1994.94-455,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1797.029,1798.479,"Well then, what facts do you take?"
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,1883.324,1896.633,"The... reviewing the facts, or a question of fact, Your Honor, is subordinate to getting, in my view to getting to what the real issue is."
1994.94-455,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.227,1908.0,"Well, I can't decide whether or not it's clear unless I know whether the policeman's in the door towards one room, or in the other room."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,1916.726,1925.161,"If you're a court of appeals judge, it seems to me, though, that you would take the facts most favorable to the nonmoving party as--"
1994.94-455,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1925.161,1932.718,"Yes, most favorable as supported in the record, right, and now what I've done is I've gone through the record to make my summary judgment determination."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,1932.718,1933.479,--Okay.
1994.94-455,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.691,1939.161,Which?
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,1955.993,1957.603,"Yes, I--"
1994.94-455,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.603,1962.467,The problem with that is in many of these cases that was long by the boards.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,1984.461,1985.292,--Yes.
1994.94-455,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.687,2018.254,And the court of appeals would simply review what the district court had done on summary judgment.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2018.254,2020.173,--That is what is being suggested here.
1994.94-455,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.962,2034.593,Yes.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2034.593,2037.014,--deciding to send a case to a jury.
1994.94-455,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.014,2043.279,But you've admitted that the court of appeals has to go through all this anyway to decide what the immunity claim is.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2046.401,2050.445,I think that this Court's recent decision--
1994.94-455,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.445,2068.545,"I mean, I could understand your position if these immunity motions were motions in limine, before there's any discovery, before any evidence, but then you'd just have to go on what's in the complaint, but if you bring up one of these motions in a summary judgment context, after there's been discovery, where the other side has to have had the opportunity to make discovery, all that goes up into court."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2070.177,2079.614,"--I think this Court's recent decision in Swint is instructive on that, and I think you just... you have to go back and--"
1994.94-455,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.614,2088.42,"I think your answer is the statute, that there... we don't have open-ended authority to provide interlocutory appeals."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2097.217,2098.056,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2110.184,2113.105,But I'm still concerned with what Justice Breyer's concern was.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2132.509,2133.26,No--
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2133.26,2144.267,"Only the second goes to the court of appeals, because if you say that, then we're reversing the usual order in which we don't reach constitutional questions if it's not necessary to do so."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2144.267,2159.006,"--If the first case were allowed to be determined, or an appeal would be allowed to be entertained, it wouldn't help anybody else handling any other type of claim."
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2168.493,2198.993,"No, but you're asking the court of appeals... suppose both issues are in the case, and you're asking the court of appeals to reach an important, difficult constitutional question which might not be necessary, because there is a strong argument that the facts don't establish the position anyway, and that this is reversing the usual presumption, which is that we don't reach constitutional issues unless we have to, and the defendant in this case says you don't have to."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2198.993,2214.465,"--To say that, Your Honor, though, I think would be to say that a court of appeals is in a better decision... a better position, or an equal position with the district court to review factual determinations."
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.645,2219.477,"Well, but this is always a question of law."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2220.959,2230.303,But when the courts of appeals review the facts to determine whether or not clearly established law was violated--
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2230.303,2232.654,They're reviewing the pleadings on summary judgment.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2233.736,2241.553,"--Courts of appeals, in an interlocutory appeals setting where a qualified immunity defense is asserted?"
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2241.553,2243.743,"Not in an interlocutory setting, of course."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2243.743,2251.808,"The general rule, I thought, Your Honor, is that you cannot take an immediate appeal just because you had a motion for summary judgment denied."
1994.94-455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2257.121,2270.451,"Well, Mr. Proctor, can't you argue that you're not really reaching a constitutional issue when your only question in effect is, what was the state of the law at the time of the act?"
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2273.292,2283.098,"That is an appropriate question for appellate review on an interlocutory appeal, whether... what was the state of the law when the acts were allegedly done."
1994.94-455,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2283.098,2329.579,"If that's appropriate, then maybe one answer to the problem which I think bothers all of us that Justice Breyer raised would be to say, if the courts of appeals are going far afield in the records when qualified immunity issues come up, the answer perhaps is that they should not be doing that, and they in effect should simply be deciding the qualified immunity issues based on the facts pleaded in the plaintiff's pleadings and go no further, and if that's... if they confine their review to that, then it would be very easy to make a distinction between that kind of a case and the case that is before us here."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2329.579,2330.619,Yes.
1994.94-455,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.619,2339.124,But that would pretty much eliminate the value to the defendant of the interlocutory appeal in Mitchell v. Forsyth.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2355.295,2362.819,"Yes, there can be orders entered for limited discovery, and has been so in some of the cases that I read."
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2372.387,2387.485,"Well, it would seem to me odd to start constructing discovery rules based on preserving an interlocutory right of appeal under the Cohen doctrine, but perhaps what you could say is something like pendent jurisdiction."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2416.886,2424.639,But you would still be making factual determinations if you did that which--
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2424.639,2434.727,"Well, these are factual determinations of the kind the appellate court can make in a summary judgment context, i.e., to determine the sufficiency of the evidence and the allegations to go forward."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2434.727,2442.272,"--Well, this case, for example, there were police reports filed by all of the police individuals."
1994.94-455,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.942,2463.665,"And the police officers said, if we did that, no question we violated clearly established law."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2515.5,2529.309,"--Exactly, Justice Ginsburg, and that determination... let's say that... well, the district court in this case found that a question of fact exists as to whether they did the deeds that were complained of."
1994.94-455,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2543.208,2548.51,"But appellate courts do review sufficiency of the evidence, but they usually do it after the trial is over."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2548.51,2585.136,"--Yes, after a much clearer record has been made, rather than vague affidavits and inconsistent statements being made and thousands of pages, perhaps, of deposition testimony, and that, it's our position, is the more appropriate time to review the sufficiency of the evidence at trial, not the sufficiency of evidence before trial, or not what a jury might... which fact a jury might hang their hat on or do we think that the jury might believe this fact or the other fact as opposed to this defendant as opposed to the plaintiff."
1994.94-455,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2585.136,2596.853,"But there's still the problem, the haunting problem, try to explain to an officer who says, my buddy had an idea that he may be doing something wrong but it wasn't clear."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2609.021,2611.984,"Okay, I just, if I can, put it in the context of this case."
1994.94-455,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.086,2650.228,We'll resume there xx 1:00 p.m.--
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2669.689,2673.162,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-455,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.632,2722.824,"But of course, the district court doesn't find facts on a motion for summary judgment."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2722.824,2723.375,No.
1994.94-455,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.096,2732.951,It may... it decides how it rules on the basis of either uncontroverted facts or those that are controverted in favor of the nonmoving party.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2732.951,2738.624,And then lays out the facts that the district court found persuasive to that point.
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2738.624,2743.51,So you're confined to the facts the district court thought was relevant to the legal inquiry?
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2743.51,2764.281,"That would be our position, with... in an interlocutory appeal, to decide whether or not a question of fact exists, or decide whether or not the district court was correct in finding there were sufficient facts, or really, if there was a fact that a jury could find would prove the guilt or innocence."
1994.94-455,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2764.281,2768.064,But I thought you were saying that's what the appellate court should not be doing.
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2768.064,2785.155,"I don't think the appellate court should be doing that, but in answer to your question, Your Honor, if in fact they are to review... I think your question was along the lines, what factual inquiry if these appeals are allowed should the appellate court review."
1994.94-455,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2785.155,2791.139,"Only if you lose this case, and your case is that there is no interlocutory review when it's only a question of what happened."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2791.139,2811.601,"Absolutely, and that's our position, and that's... and our position is certainly the district court is in every bit as good if not better position to make factual determinations as to whether a question of fact exists or whether or not a case should go to a jury than an appellate court, and that is absolutely unequivocally our position."
1994.94-455,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.601,2816.637,"But you get an awful lot of... I mean, I'm not saying this is an insuperable problem."
1994.94-455,2,22946,edward_g_proctor_jr,,2859.693,2867.119,"Okay, as opposed to in this case there was a memorandum order which was written by the magistrate judge."
1994.94-455,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2952.305,2954.836,"Thank you, Mr. Proctor."
1994.94-455,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2957.378,2958.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-455,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3002.948,3007.34,"It is not always inextricably bound, though, is it?"
1994.94-455,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3007.34,3008.081,"Well, I think--"
1994.94-455,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3008.081,3011.834,"And I'm... the reason I ask is, I'm wondering if we could make a distinction on that basis."
1994.94-455,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3011.834,3014.606,"--Well, I think typically it will be, certainly in the case--"
1994.94-455,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3014.606,3017.708,Typically this case is not at all bound up in that question.
1994.94-455,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3033.268,3039.671,"--But the question is, Justice Ginsburg, is the conduct of the defendant violative of clearly established law?"
1994.94-455,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3042.813,3056.942,"I thought, and tell me if I'm wrong, this case is a very good case for an illustration, because there were two questions, one that did involve the interlocutory appeal, was there probable cause to arrest, a question of law."
1994.94-455,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3074.753,3078.496,"--Let's look at the first point, the probable cause issue."
1994.94-455,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3102.102,3106.606,That's a case where you have an appeal because there is a question of law.
1994.94-455,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3106.606,3106.904,Now--
1994.94-455,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3106.904,3111.038,When you don't have any question of law... this case is one where there is no question of law.
1994.94-455,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3111.038,3116.852,"--Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, the question is... there is a question of law."
1994.94-455,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3162.272,3163.605,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
