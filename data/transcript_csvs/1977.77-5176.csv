1977.77-5176,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.265,"We'll hear arguments next in 5176, Franks against Delaware."
1977.77-5176,0,21005,donald_w_huntley,,61.624,62.079,Thank you.
1977.77-5176,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,91.211,101.936,"But is there nothing, a related question that flows from that, if there's enough in the warrant which is true to support the search?"
1977.77-5176,0,21005,donald_w_huntley,,105.346,106.809,"Yes, that's true."
1977.77-5176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.31,194.751,"Mr. Huntley, I've read the colloquy between Judge Bush and trial counsel in the Delaware trial court and I gather what his -- what the trial counsel sought to contest was the affiance representation as to what had been told him by two other people, is that correct?"
1977.77-5176,0,21005,donald_w_huntley,,194.751,196.107,"Not entirely, Your Honor."
1977.77-5176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.107,198.944,"Well, what -- and in what respect does that incorrect?"
1977.77-5176,0,21005,donald_w_huntley,,198.944,209.833,The contested allegations in the search warrant affidavit were very simply whether certain conversations took place at all.
1977.77-5176,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.223,243.021,And he wanted to show that they had not had any conversations with the affiant and the affiant had said they had?
1977.77-5176,0,21005,donald_w_huntley,,243.021,245.577,Exactly.
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,1807.816,1812.535,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2086.539,2096.737,But it -- it certainly indicated that the anticipative putting on the testimony of informers who would deny that they had any conversations like that at all?
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2096.737,2102.254,"When you say informer sir, they were named witnesses."
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2102.254,2103.061,Yes.
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2109.1,2111.049,"That's he wanted to do, Your Honor."
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2114.564,2126.501,But what if he had a -- what if he had prepared an informal offer of proof to which was attached affidavits of the witnesses?
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2126.501,2128.557,"That's a different proposition, Your Honor."
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2128.718,2131.972,"Well, why would that be different in terms of the fourth corners rule?"
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2131.972,2149.887,"Well, Rule 41(c) of the Delaware Criminal Rules specifies on supression of evidence that the motion will be by affidavit -- supported by affidavit, I should say, and specifies all this."
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2149.887,2162.006,"But would you -- would you say that it's a -- would you say that if he hadn't made a formal offer of proof supported by affidavits by -- of the witnesses who say, “We never had any conversation with the officer, whatsoever?”"
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2165.105,2166.048,If he had shown --
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2166.048,2173.819,And then that -- then let's suppose the Delaware Court had still said “It doesn't make any difference what your submission is.
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2177.421,2179.313,No.
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2181.653,2185.403,Constitutionally wrong?
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2185.403,2186.256,Constitutional --
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2186.256,2187.686,"Well, that's what the issue is here."
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2193.225,2204.891,"I would say it's not constitutionally wrong, unless the court considers the -- and the only out would be judicial integrity, it would appear to me in that case."
1977.77-5176,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2204.891,2214.496,"Well, you would still say that Delaware constitutionally could say “We're going to -- we're just not going to allow any kind of an attack on the -- on the warrant.”"
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2222.643,2223.468,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.77-5176,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.468,2226.354,"Certainly, that's what the Supreme Court Delaware said."
1977.77-5176,1,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2226.354,2228.418,"Now, when we come --"
1977.77-5176,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.418,2231.276,"Well, didn't -- didn't the Supreme Court of Delaware take that position?"
1977.77-5176,2,21005,donald_w_huntley,,2572.562,2573.82,I'd just like to --
1977.77-5176,3,28230,harrison_f_turner,,2581.587,2582.214,Rugendorf?
1977.77-5176,4,21005,donald_w_huntley,,2618.738,2627.485,I would merely like to take issue with Colonel Turner's characterization of the present question as an extension of the exclusionary rule.
1977.77-5176,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2654.126,2655.12,"Well, thank you gentlemen."
