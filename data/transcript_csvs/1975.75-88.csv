1975.75-88,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,4.793,We will hear next Matthews against Lucas.
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,13.57,16.52,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.654,281.48,You happen to know where that phrase was first used?
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,281.48,283.723,Compelling governmental interest?
1975.75-88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.778,290.59,"The Cramer case which was in 1969, would that be right?"
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,290.59,292.7,I am not sure of the date.
1975.75-88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.7,293.198,Okay.
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,301.454,301.793,That is correct.
1975.75-88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.793,302.894,Not as the doctrine?
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,302.894,303.892,"But it became one, I think."
1975.75-88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.892,304.473,That is right.
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,308.615,317.843,But other classifications continued to be reviewed under the traditional rational basis test which required only a minimal showing of rationality.
1975.75-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.345,376.476,You do not take the Caroline Products putting all this as an article of faith then? [Laughter]
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,376.476,379.917,"In what sense an article of faith, Mr. Justice Rehnquist?"
1975.75-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.917,387.206,"Well, you do not believe that it has the stature of being bodily incorporated into the constitution?"
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,387.206,391.721,The footnote in the Caroline Products case?
1975.75-88,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,391.721,400.89,It was not an equal protection footnote of the First Amendment --
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,400.89,405.164,It would be of assistance to counsel [Laughter].
1975.75-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.79,413.245,I withdraw my question.[Laughter]
1975.75-88,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,413.245,426.319,"At any rate, with consideration such as those I have just indicated in mind, to perhaps in mind, the court has it seems to me perceptively and gradually altered its approach to equal protection cases."
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1588.666,1591.723,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-88,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.582,1649.191,Weight to this with high scrutiny and strict scrutiny?
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1649.191,1676.786,"A strict scrutiny and I would contend under a scrutiny, if there is indeed abrasion, we -- illegitimate children are somewhere at the top end of that gradient and the difference would be this, and people would be placed along the gradient I presume, one criteria to place upon that would be are there are class that has no control over the status that they are being discriminated against here and that is the case here in illegitimate kid situation."
1975.75-88,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.777,1687.672,But how about discrimination against Catholics.
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1696.003,1698.507,"Unless there are First Amendment overtones, yes sir."
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1745.51,1751.043,Sometimes can we get that right out of the words they use such the word “dependent?”
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1751.043,1759.347,"Indeed you can, indeed you can and if that what is they intended and if they say with own words that is the place to get it."
1975.75-88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1759.347,1762.038,"It is a pretty good source, is it not, the language of the statute?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,1762.038,1763.118,Indeed it is.
1975.75-88,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2018.838,2025.57,I look to your example of adopted children and stepchildren.
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2038.005,2055.152,"Okay, The Social Security Administration, if you are an adopted child and you are not an illegitimate child in this class presumes that you were in fact dependent upon your natural father, and you can automatically assume you prove his is your father get Social Security benefits under the Act."
1975.75-88,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.668,2065.599,You cannot get both?
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2065.599,2066.563,You cannot get both.
1975.75-88,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2080.118,2084.725,You have not answered my observations that a lot of these do not have two potentials?
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2084.725,2085.911,That is true.
1975.75-88,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2087.641,2091.203,"Probably, it is often true, is it not?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2099.598,2102.798,"Okay, I concede that that is true."
1975.75-88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2102.798,2120.109,"Well, then given that most states can seal the identity of illegitimate children, identity of the father in adoption proceedings, your generalization really does not wash as to illegitimate children."
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2125.817,2127.265,Find out the identity of his own father?
1975.75-88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2127.265,2128.395,Yes.
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2128.395,2129.889,"Well, it is in some circumstances."
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.768,2220.765,How about the presumption or the notion as you call it that the class you are interested in is normally not supported?
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2220.765,2226.733,"There is a presumption of the class that Rev. Norton is not supportive, was not previously supported by the deceased father."
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.733,2229.174,There is that Congressional presumption.
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2229.174,2230.555,That is --
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.555,2230.82,Yes.
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2230.82,2232.424,That is one way that the Act could be read.
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.424,2233.324,Yes.
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2238.772,2238.915,Okay.
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.915,2239.654,-- around and believe and --
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2239.654,2240.429,Here is an example.
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.429,2245.884,-- but there is no question about what Congress concluded the evidence showed?
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2245.884,2252.197,If you ascribe that intent to Congress and if Congress indicated that finding by the way it structured the Act.
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.197,2256.141,"Well, assume it did, assume it did?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2256.141,2260.215,Same Congress assumed then that these other categories were more likely (Voice Overlap)
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.215,2268.25,Then you are suggesting as we should disagree with Congress because we think we have a better notion of what the facts are?
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2268.25,2270.008,"Well, my contention is this."
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.722,2286.674,"What about Congress so, they have -- Congress has come down and made its own judgment (Voice Overlap)"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2286.674,2292.134,"Assuming Congress has made that judgment which I of course did not concede, I think this Court still has a role."
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.459,2305.529,"Well, would our test be we just disagree with them or should we ask is there some basis, any basis in fact for the congressional conclusion?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2305.529,2310.159,"Well, the Secretary has had the chance to show you whatever basis Congress might have had."
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.43,2313.492,Yes.
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2323.183,2331.473,"No, there is evidence to indicate that they can -- it is really not clear who is more likely to be a supporters than not."
1975.75-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.543,2340.789,There is evidence to indicate that there is?
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2340.789,2357.225,"There is this one study which was done and it is not conclusive says “That 89% of absent illegitimate fathers, we call them that, do not support their children, whereas 81% or 82% of absent legitimate fathers do not support their children”."
1975.75-88,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2390.202,2402.644,"Mr. Brown, would the presumption had been rebutted in this case if the father had simply written a letter to the mother inquiring how that son was?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2402.644,2404.35,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.75-88,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2404.35,2405.62,There are a lot of who would have done it?
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2405.62,2418.42,That would have done it and problem is that people who are fathers of illegitimate children do not take to the habits of writing letters and going through the formalities that a lot of middle class people traditionally do.
1975.75-88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2470.001,2498.45,"Mr. Brown, you seem to disparage somewhat the idea that the element of fraud was present in these cases, but for a number of centuries, not year, centuries, the explanation for not allowing illegitimate children to inherit from a father was the fraud element, was it not?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2499.508,2501.279,It is probably correct and I think that there are --
1975.75-88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2501.279,2504.0,"Probably, there is any doubt about it?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2504.0,2505.05,I do not think that is the only reason.
1975.75-88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2521.9,2540.683,"Most of the states who have statutes permitting the recognition of the illegitimate child in giving certain rights and are not the statutes were concerned with patterned on those statutes, that is the acknowledgment in writing for example?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2540.683,2542.085,"Well, there are three ways."
1975.75-88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.795,2554.456,"That maybe, that maybe by having a written acknowledgment from the father?"
1975.75-88,1,18359,c_christopher_brown,,2554.456,2560.286,"Indeed and in Maryland for instance, all you have to do is openly -- have openly acknowledge that someone is your father."
1975.75-88,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.28,2616.967,Do you have any thing further Mr. Jones?
1975.75-88,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,2616.967,2619.119,"Yes, I would like to make three quick points Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.75-88,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2619.119,2620.973,You have just have three minutes to do it.
1975.75-88,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,2620.973,2623.213,"I do, one minute in each."
1975.75-88,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2739.654,2740.343,Thank you gentlemen.
