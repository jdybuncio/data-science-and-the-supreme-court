2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.404,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-1125, Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,8.404,8.987,Thank you.
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,14.522,18.609,Maybe you could lift the podium?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,18.609,28.449,"Actually, I have never used this before, so it's a learning experience for me, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,28.449,30.166,That's enough.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,30.166,31.35,Okay?
2008.07-1125,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,31.35,32.685,We can't see you.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,34.635,35.804,"That -- that may be an advantage, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,35.804,36.454,But we can hear you.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,36.454,40.172,"If -- if I should modify it, please -- please let me know."
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,103.865,112.202,"Counsel, there's -- there's a little bit of an air of unreality about all this, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a cause of action in title IX to start with."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,128.147,133.301,"Well, I -- I guess there -- there are a number of points that I -- I can make in response to that, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.161,162.385,"Maybe the question ought to be whether this Court intended to have the title IX action, which it invented, preclude 1983."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,164.353,166.355,"--Well, I -- I think not, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,167.689,170.807,Would you agree that this Court invented the cause of action?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,170.807,172.426,"--No, I -- I don't agree with that."
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.496,258.448,Did we rely on that provision in implying the right of action under title IX?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,258.448,260.65,--The -- the Court did not.
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.971,303.81,"Mr. Rothfeld, I follow your argument entirely, and then in the civil rights area there are a lot of overlapping statutes."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,375.091,383.262,"Well, that -- that is right, Your Honor, to the extent that the claims are identical and that they have actually been adjudicated."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.997,408.83,What more?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,414.751,418.619,"Well, I -- I guess there are -- are two points in -- in response to that, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,428.141,433.545,We will give you an extra 10 seconds.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,435.079,437.081,"And I -- I assure you I will -- I will use them, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.542,459.577,Spell that out -- spell that out practically.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,461.529,479.658,"--Well, I think -- for example, Your Honor, we think that one thing that -- that could be developed and explored further is disparate treatment of complaints; for example, the treatment of complaints of bullying by boys more favorably than complaints of harassment by girls, believing testimony of boys rather than believing testimony of girls."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.658,482.209,--But there was no allegation at all of that kind in this complaint.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,482.209,486.077,I -- I -- I agree that that was not set out specifically in the complaint.
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.677,514.914,"I mean, could you have brought a claim that they didn't let the female students play hockey, under your complaint?"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,516.783,518.166,"--Well, I think--"
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,518.166,520.582,Didn't it have to be related to the particular facts?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,520.582,521.451,"--Yes, that's right."
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,521.801,525.586,And is there -- and you talked about you wanted some additional discovery.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,539.245,543.631,"--Well, there are a number of points I should make in response to that, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,557.124,591.278,"The reason I ask is obviously if this case happens to be a case in which, because of the finding that there was no intentional discrimination and the school board behaved properly, that if that's the finding and therefore you have no claim under 1983 in respect to that, it becomes very theoretical to say that they went too far and said you might have no other 1983 claim because you would have some other 1983 claim, but we should dismiss this as improvidently granted and wait until somebody does this again."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,591.278,594.897,"--Well, certainly -- I -- certainly, I understand that suggestion, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,617.929,618.846,I still don't follow.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,626.518,628.22,--That -- that would be one way in which--
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.22,632.688,"And as far as this record shows, there has just been this one incident of harassment--"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,632.688,641.861,"--Again, Your Honor, I think one of the problems is that this case sort of went off the tracks at the earliest possible stage, at the -- at the time that the motion to dismiss was granted."
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,658.406,659.14,Is that request here in the record?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,659.14,660.122,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,660.122,661.457,Is that request here?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,661.457,663.476,The discovery request?
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,663.476,667.678,Do I have the request in the joint -- in the -- do I have it in the appendix here?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,667.678,668.195,"No, no."
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.828,670.397,"So, we don't even have it in front of us?"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,670.397,671.463,--You do not have it in front of you.
2008.07-1125,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.97,709.688,"Mr. Rothfeld, we were -- we were warned about all these problems in the brief in opposition, weren't we?"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,709.688,710.388,That is correct.
2008.07-1125,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.388,716.611,Didn't that focus almost entirely upon the fact that there is no 1983 cause of action anyway?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,716.611,717.711,That is exactly--
2008.07-1125,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.711,719.896,And we nonetheless granted -- granted cert?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,719.896,731.621,--Precisely the same arguments were made in almost identical language in the brief in opposition that are now being made as an argument as to why this Court should decide the merits of the 1983 claim or dismiss as improvidently granted.
2008.07-1125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.643,756.653,"Do I understand, Mr. Rothfeld, that if you win on the question presented, you would agree that the -- the arguments the other side makes on the -- on whether there's a cause of action under equal protection and so forth, that would remain open on remand?"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,756.653,757.469,Absolutely.
2008.07-1125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.469,760.121,And you may still lose the lawsuit even if you win here?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,760.121,761.557,That is -- that is absolutely correct.
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.975,821.761,--But we find that out on remand.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,821.761,822.877,--And we'll find that out on remand.
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,822.877,824.963,What you're saying is they made a basic legal error.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,824.963,826.863,That's--
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,826.863,834.485,"You may have a losing case under 1983, but let the First Circuit decide that?"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,834.485,836.135,--That -- that is absolutely correct.
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.771,845.008,How do we know that the First Circuit wasn't just thinking about the facts of this case in front of it when it said that there's no 1983 action.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,865.254,877.579,"--Well, I -- I think one of the problems is, of course, we don't know for sure what -- what they were thinking, and therefore, it makes sense, I think, for this Court, in the regular course of its practice, to decide the question presented and to send the case back down to the lower courts to--"
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.579,890.406,"But you see, the question presented, I guess is -- I'm trying to get the exact words, but it's whether the title IX replaces the -- what is it, it's whether -- I'm sorry."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,892.272,897.825,--Whether title IX precludes the assertion of constitutional claims for gender discrimination in schools under section 1983.
2008.07-1125,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,899.844,905.915,"You think they're -- they're referring to all of title IX, no matter what the claims, whether they are overlapping or not?"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,905.915,911.569,--I think that that is the language that the First Circuit used.
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,919.591,926.495,"Well, because they were relying on cases where we did say that a very detailed scheme was pre-emptive."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,926.495,942.956,"They were relying on one case in which the Court said that, in Smith v. Robinson, the only time in 140 years that section 1983 has been on the books that this Court has ever said that Congress meant to preclude its use to enforce a particular constitutional right."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.206,952.229,"And it did that because if you could use 1983, then the very elaborate mechanism that Congress had set up, who would use it?"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,952.229,953.912,--That's -- that's absolutely right.
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.55,962.085,Just on that one issue on attorneys' fees.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,962.085,966.656,"--Well, I think that the language used is actually broader in the -- in the corrected legislation."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1036.633,1040.537,Have there been any decisions on title VI and 1983?
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1040.537,1043.489,There -- there have been myriad such decisions.
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1133.712,1146.954,"Well, of course, title IX is Spending Clause legislation, and that, under our precedents, imposes certain limitations on how we interpret it that would not be applicable under section 1983."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1146.954,1148.322,Absolutely correct.
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1149.522,1156.912,"Well, the point is that that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent those limitations on the title IX remedy."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1156.912,1160.28,"--Well, I -- I think not, for a couple of reasons, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1182.377,1200.357,"And those constitutional rights have -- I think it might be -- it's at least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983 case, given that, as to the individual, you have qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have to show a custom or practice."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1200.357,1230.643,"--Well, the only availability for individual liability is under the Constitution, because title IX, at least as construed by the lower courts, does not permit suits directly against the individual, only against the institution, which I think is a significant distinction between the two and supports the argument that Congress could not have intended to preclude it because, as the Court has recognized, repeatedly, the availability of individual liability greatly adds to the -- the deterrence, the effect of deterring constitutional violations."
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1436.659,1441.461,I take it they don't have to bring these actions together.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1447.432,1460.875,"Well, I think that to the extent -- as was suggested by Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning, to the extent that the claims are the same, then they would preclude it, the 1983 claim, if it has the same elements, if it's the same cause of action--"
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1460.875,1463.227,"It would be a different claim, but there would be issue preclusion."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1463.227,1464.761,"--There would be issue -- yes, that's right."
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1464.761,1469.73,"Even if you have different -- I guess you would have a different set of defendants, right?"
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1476.134,1495.448,"I think, to the extent that the suit was initially brought against the school under title IX for a type of claim that could have been brought as a parallel claim against the individual under section 1983, and the title IX claim was rejected, to the extent that the elements are the same, presumably there would be a defensive claim of collateral estoppel."
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.448,1500.267,And the official -- it's the plaintiff who would be precluded.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1500.267,1500.852,That's right.
2008.07-1125,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1500.852,1504.888,And the plaintiff has had a full and fair opportunity to argue those issues.
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1504.888,1506.371,That's exactly correct.
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1511.724,1512.826,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1125,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1512.826,1513.226,--Thank you.
2008.07-1125,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.226,1523.282,"Ms. Hodge, we will hear from you on behalf of the Barnstable School Committee."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1523.282,1524.967,Thank you.
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1548.249,1549.682,Go over -- go over that again.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1552.801,1554.07,--Title IX--
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1554.07,1557.772,--against sex discrimination than the Constitution does.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1557.772,1558.472,--Correct.
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1558.472,1559.89,Explain that to me.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1559.89,1566.311,The title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1607.269,1607.788,Give me an example.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1607.788,1616.375,An -- an example would be the situation such as this -- this particular situation.
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1626.499,1628.951,And what would the standard be under 1983?
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1628.951,1662.089,"The standard under 1983 is also deliberate indifference, but it requires then that the deliberate indifference be shown to be not just the act of a school administrator who does not do what they should do in order to pursue a particular complaint; but, rather, there needs to be the specific intent to discriminate or -- specific intent to choose boys over girls or girls over boys in that decisionmaking process."
2008.07-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.089,1668.759,"Yes, but if you lose under -- under title IX, a fortiori, you would lose under the Constitution, I would think."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1668.759,1699.214,"I -- I believe -- and that is, in essence, the position that the Barnstable School Committee and Superintendent Dever are arguing in this case; that is, that because deliberate indifference is the standard that is applicable both under title IX and also under the Constitution, that it is -- it is -- having lost the issue of deliberate indifference before the First Circuit, that finding of the First Circuit precludes any further controversy between the parties in this case."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1699.214,1701.53,But they didn't go on issue preclusion.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1717.926,1732.952,"I believe -- I believe, Your Honor, that we have a situation in which you have both claim preclusion -- both preclusion under Smith v. Robinson as well as issue preclusion, which makes it somewhat complicated."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1775.965,1776.565,But--
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1776.565,1777.598,--an implied right of action.
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1777.598,1792.691,"--You -- you must, I think, recognize that the elaborate scheme that Congress set up under the Education of the Handicapped Act is quite different from what this Court did."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1808.533,1809.867,There is not.
2008.07-1125,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1831.649,1838.303,You are not arguing that the agency regulations have the effect of precluding a 1983 action?
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1838.303,1838.853,--No.
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.781,1863.102,"Are you saying -- is this what you are saying: We imagine that we have a institution that is receiving Federal assistance, okay?"
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1900.777,1904.262,"--Your Honor, what I am saying is I cannot imagine one."
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.031,1905.797,You cannot imagine one.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1914.303,1916.319,--I believe that that is true.
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.319,1916.719,Okay.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1916.719,1917.505,And I would point out--
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.505,1917.788,That's simple.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,1917.788,1930.579,"--that in response to the Petitioners' argument today, they have attempted to suggest that there may be some issues that were not discovered; that were not, in fact, fully reviewed by the court below."
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.104,2077.572,Does a disparate-impact claim violate section -- title IX?
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2077.572,2088.53,"--There -- there -- it is not 100 percent clear except for the following, and I would suggest this: Title IX prohibits discrimination."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.268,2126.655,Do you have any case in all of title IX where -- that fits that abstract picture that you have just described?
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2169.149,2171.534,"Well, I believe--"
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2171.534,2186.277,"Can you describe a title IX case that's like Feeney in that respect where we didn't want this diverse impact to occur; we really didn't want it at all, but it happened?"
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2186.277,2192.097,--I believe that the fact that it happens is sufficient discrimination to come under title IX.
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.599,2220.45,On the basis of gender.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2220.45,2222.383,--On the basis of gender.
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2225.902,2228.854,And Feeney says it wasn't on the basis of gender.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2230.722,2244.566,"--But you see, I believe that the impact, which would have been that an individual would not have been allowed to participate, may be an additive factual conclusion which would go to the general discrimination issue."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2256.807,2263.61,But there is -- there is -- you are leaving out something quite glaring in that respect.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2275.001,2370.999,"Oh, you are absolutely correct, Your Honor, and under those circumstances, we would suggest that, as this Court found in Mississippi v. Hogan, that those institutions would then be subject to section 1983 review, but on the highly constitutional standard which requires intentional discrimination; and second of all, we believe that that is -- that Mississippi is an illustration of the reason why the argument of Petitioner regarding 2000h of title IX, which deals with the fact that -- that when they passed title IX, they also reserved the opportunity for the Attorney General to become involved in a case under 1983, that the intention of that language was not necessarily to preserve 1983 in cases against recipients who are in fact covered, but it would have been to reserve the right of the Attorney General to -- to intervene in cases in which either the institution was not covered -- because you are absolutely right, there are institutions which are not covered -- and as you decided in Mississippi v. Hogan, they would be subject to section 1983; and/or individuals that the First Circuit recognized might, because they -- if they are -- if they are State actors, that is not the case you have here, which was peer-on-peer harassment -- but if you had a situation where for example, a teacher or an administrator was in fact the alleged harasser, that a 1983 could be brought against the individual, and indeed the -- the Attorney General could intervene in those cases."
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2370.999,2375.534,"If it's an individual, under title IX you can't bring the suit?"
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2375.534,2376.184,Correct.
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.184,2376.903,All right.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2378.186,2379.753,Correct.
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.753,2380.105,Okay.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2380.105,2380.638,But--
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.638,2395.197,"So your point then is -- and that's why I've had trouble with this case -- is that if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort of seems to say: If there's a difference, of course you can have a 1983 suit, but if there's no difference, you can't."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2418.58,2446.63,"--Well, I would argue -- I would argue, of course, that I would hope that this Court would take -- would affirm the First Circuit opinion, but I would say to -- to -- to Your Honor the following: that with regard to the individual defendant in this case, who is a superintendent of schools, who as we argue, the question presented only deals with the institutional recipient; but nevertheless the First Circuit found that the individual was acting only in their official capacity."
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2463.192,2468.495,"So you are saying if it's an individual acting in his official capacity, you cannot sue him under title IX?"
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2468.495,2469.995,--To the -- yes.
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2469.995,2470.495,Yes.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2470.995,2471.78,Yes.
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.78,2480.653,"Then their answer to that which -- say, look, we want to sue an individual in his official capacity; that's why we want to bring our 1983 suit."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2488.79,2489.409,Issue preclusion.
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.409,2490.309,They all have new names.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2492.028,2492.561,They do.
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.561,2493.961,But the -- the -- okay.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2512.089,2512.774,The court--
2008.07-1125,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2512.774,2515.643,"--collateral estoppel, or -- you understand what I mean."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2515.643,2526.915,"--Your Honor, I believe that they did decide that in the language that I did quote to you just a moment ago from the First Circuit opinion, which is found at the appendix 23a -- or the decision."
2008.07-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.08,2579.984,"Yet the other side says that there may be, and I don't know why we ought to get into that."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2607.819,2615.49,Because there must be an issue in controversy for this Court to send any -- there must be an issue in controversy here and also--
2008.07-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.49,2617.175,He says there is an issue in controversy.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2620.092,2628.114,"--Well -- well, with all due respect, I would suggest that what you have to look at is the complaint, and you have to look at the argument, you know, what was in fact argued."
2008.07-1125,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2630.233,2631.483,So -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2659.15,2666.739,--I don't -- I don't believe that that is -- that that -- that that should -- that should be the result of your decisionmaking.
2008.07-1125,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2666.739,2682.515,"It's kind of odd to say that -- as I understand what you are saying, you are saying whenever there is issue preclusion, a consequence is that 1983 is precluded in the sense that actions were precluded in Smith."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2700.377,2703.412,I -- I believe that that would be satisfactory.
2008.07-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.268,2719.874,"But that doesn't -- that doesn't cover the situation in which a plaintiff says, I don't want to proceed under title IX; I want to proceed first under 1983."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2728.663,2732.848,--There's no question but in those circumstances then as to an institution--
2008.07-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.848,2734.317,What's your position on that--
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2734.317,2741.704,--Our position is that as a recipient of Federal -- if the institution involved is a recipient of Federal financial assistance who is covered by title IX--
2008.07-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.704,2743.739,--You can't proceed under 1983.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2743.739,2745.108,--You cannot proceed under section 1983.
2008.07-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.108,2745.508,So you are disagreeing.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2745.508,2746.708,"Yes, we are."
2008.07-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.708,2747.475,You are disagreeing.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2747.475,2764.336,"Oh, no, we are disagreeing, and I would suggest that the difficulty that this Court is having, or at least as I experience it, the difficulty with regard to issue preclusion and claim preclusion turns in this case on the fact that this perhaps being a peer-on-peer harassment case--"
2008.07-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.336,2776.81,"Isn't it quite clear that we can forget about issue preclusion and assume, as Justice Scalia did, that the plaintiff brought an action under 1983 and did not rely on title IX at all, and just sued the school board?"
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2778.679,2779.512,--Correct.
2008.07-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.829,2782.464,"And that's your issue, whether that's right or wrong."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2786.083,2796.724,"That is correct, except that as we argue -- what we have argued before the Court is that under Smith the question is, is there a comprehensive remedial scheme?"
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.977,2811.983,"Wouldn't your reasoning apply to, say, a race discrimination case in employment?"
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2842.685,2857.279,"--I believe that -- that there is that argument, but to be honest, I'm not in a position right now to reflect on exactly -- I believe that that would be certainly the direction, however, there are unique aspects of race."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2875.824,2878.176,What has that got to do with what you were arguing?
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2906.445,2909.664,I guess I -- I don't agree.
2008.07-1125,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2969.786,2975.254,"Well, that's -- that's because we're still in the business of implying rights of action under Bivens."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,2987.312,2998.036,"--Well, that is correct, except that this Court has, in fact, applied its preclusion doctrine by looking at whether or not Congress has made any statement in the statute."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3044.334,3050.904,There was no constitutional claim in -- what was it -- Palos Verdes.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3050.904,3051.721,Exactly.
2008.07-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.985,3152.354,Let me ask you one sort of anomaly that keeps running through my mind in this case.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3166.228,3172.732,--It is exactly our view because the recipient would be subject to the remedial scheme set forth in title IX.
2008.07-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.732,3174.2,Isn't it sort of anomalous to think it--
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3174.2,3175.367,I don't believe it's anomalous.
2008.07-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3189.627,3191.312,--But should it prove the same facts in both cases?
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3200.085,3224.366,"I believe under those circumstances, Justice Stevens, that what we would be talking about would be the situation where a -- under title IX, there is -- there's actually an easier path to recovery, if you will, because it does not require the specific intent required by Massachusetts v. Feeney, which we believe sets a slightly higher -- a higher bar and a higher level of intentionality."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3224.366,3231.354,"I thought you just said deliberate indifference under both statutes, under 1983 and title IX."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3231.354,3234.822,"Your Honor, it is -- deliberate indifference is the standard."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3269.662,3271.931,Then you wouldn't have gender discrimination.
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3271.931,3275.983,"But you -- excuse me, I'm sorry."
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3293.945,3294.912,Responds to what?
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3296.896,3299.681,--To a complaint of -- to a complaint about sexual harassment.
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3322.88,3335.373,"--So you wouldn't have -- if you work for a municipality and your boss has been harassing you, you would not have a case under 1983?"
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3335.373,3350.466,"If you were a municipality and -- and the -- and your boss was harassing you, and -- in a school setting by a recipient of Federal financial assistance?"
2008.07-1125,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3350.466,3356.453,"Well, you were saying the constitutional standard is different, so I was just giving you a case."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3362.607,3376.181,"It would -- you would need to have the specific intent, invidious intent that we believe is an additional element and a much harder element to prove in that situation."
2008.07-1125,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.181,3378.033,"Thank you, Ms. Hodge."
2008.07-1125,1,33854,kay_h_hodge,,3378.033,3378.566,Thank you.
2008.07-1125,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.566,3381.402,"Mr. Rothfeld, you have five minutes remaining."
2008.07-1125,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3381.402,3386.056,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-1125,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3500.931,3504.966,"Well, does that provision apply only when there is a title IX cause of action?"
2008.07-1125,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3504.966,3505.299,--No.
2008.07-1125,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3506.349,3511.72,"So -- well, if it doesn't, then it -- then it has validity whether or not you agree with your position."
2008.07-1125,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3511.72,3521.928,"--That's true, but I think it answers the preclusion question because it suggests that Congress has it in mind that there would in fact be section 1983 constitutional litigation involving gender discrimination."
2008.07-1125,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3521.928,3526.147,"Yes, but maybe they thought only in cases where there is no title IX action."
2008.07-1125,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3526.147,3532.284,They said whenever there is a claim of unconstitutional gender discrimination.
2008.07-1125,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3534.653,3538.038,"Oh, you don't think they mean whether there's a -- there's a valid claim?"
2008.07-1125,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3541.156,3551.53,"--I am suggesting that the language says that whenever a claim of gender discrimination is advanced under the Constitution, the Attorney General can intervene."
2008.07-1125,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3641.021,3642.038,"Thank you, counsel."
