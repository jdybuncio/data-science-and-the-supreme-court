1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1620.78,1621.068,"No, no."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1621.068,1623.732,-- a benefit for that because the Government can in this case said --
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1623.732,1624.697,The language is --
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1624.697,1626.103,-- forfeit is important.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1626.103,1626.594,That's right.
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1630.54,1633.463,But it's become important that it can't -- it can't say it strongly.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1633.463,1634.63,"It's just a matter of the fact, is in the situation."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1634.63,1635.638,All right.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1637.6,1650.689,"Now, in the Court there, was unanimous in agreeing that the proceeding there was -- did not involve a violation of double jeopardy."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1668.567,1672.656,Does the Government accept that mode of arguing?
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1672.656,1673.919,"No, sir."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1686.852,1699.732,But suppose a (Inaudible) can translate the other view and the Government says that it -- the other view is the one that (Inaudible) that on there is probably it.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1699.732,1700.829,Well I -- I would --
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1700.829,1706.356,"I know -- I understand you want to rip the case but I have decided on some rationally, so here, in the grounds."
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1706.356,1715.126,"Well, it's our position that if we adopt the view which, view as far as the Marcus and Hess that the -- there's no double jeopardy here."
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1761.669,1773.88,"Do you think that's the -- but what -- what do you think that happened in this case if this Surplus Property Act had -- had provided not only for this $2000 penalty, whatever you want to call it."
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1773.88,1774.457,Well --
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1774.457,1786.466,"-- and also ten years imprisonment, having been persecuted and $25,000 could even because of this comprehensive statutory remedy, the prosecuted --"
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1786.466,1787.027,Well I -- I
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1787.027,1789.148,-- for imprisonment for 10 years.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1789.148,1799.965,"Well, if it defines criminal statute as I understand generally, provide for imprisonment or fine or both."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1810.822,1815.186,As well the question is whether you must dispose of it all in one -- in one --
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1815.186,1815.508,-- proceeding --
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1815.508,1817.387,-- in the case of proceeding or you may break it up into two.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1817.387,1818.236,-- into two.
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1818.236,1820.844,What I'm getting is that your -- your argument would --
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1820.844,1821.673,Well I'm just -- and on --
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1821.673,1826.141,If you're here to sustain the proper -- subsequent prosecution after a fine --
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1826.141,1826.618,That's right.
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1826.618,1828.766,-- for the penal provision.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1828.766,1831.991,"But -- well, I -- that the point is this."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1846.346,1846.628,Well --
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1846.628,1848.298,-- Frankfurter's view.
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1857.07,1863.326,"Well, I'm trying to point out I think your -- your comprehensive schedule of defenses may get you into some difficulty."
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1863.326,1865.169,Well I -- it may very well be.
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1921.001,1924.325,Was --was this passed shortly after --
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1924.325,1925.13,Marcus and Hess?
1955.46,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1925.13,1925.651,Marcus and Hess?
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1925.651,1926.44,"Oh, yes."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1930.933,1955.356,"Don't take your time on this, but I just want to know whether a fellow who had great difficulty such as I do on the -- both with the Mitchell mode of argument – or he Hess mode of argument whether if you can -- reconcile themselves to those modes of argument, namely, by sticking labels on and call them civil, you take care of everything whether if hasn't got any or has difficulty with that -- great difficulty myself --"
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1955.356,1955.917,Well I -- I --
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1955.917,1960.076,-- whether -- whether the Government -- what the Government's attitude do.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1960.414,1973.637,"Well -- well I -- I appreciate the -- the problems that you have with Marcus and Hess and Helvering in this, for that reason, that I wanted to point out really the -- at the outset of my argument."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1980.276,1981.731,Because this case tests that.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1983.063,1983.381,Well --
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1983.381,1991.351,If you have -- because both in Mitchell and in Hess there were arguments that the Government was out of pocket.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,1999.95,2001.471,"No, I expect to."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2001.471,2003.161,"Well, that takes the ground from under."
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,2015.557,2016.054,Well --
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2016.054,2018.658,-- convince it for something that you haven' t thought.
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,2018.658,2025.608,"Well, there's -- there's no doubt in this case that there's no damage that we can reduce to any physical amount, to a monetary amount."
1955.46,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2026.536,2029.012,"Because that's what damages mean, monetary."
1955.46,1,36518,melvin_richter,,2032.028,2047.631,"Well, that's the very function of providing a minimum payment which I would -- I would get to in a -- by my past from your approach I -- which I think would show there's no double jeopardy in this case, to the approach which the Court, the majority, took in Marcus and Hess."
1955.46,2,25170,gustave_h_dongus,,3354.363,3355.977,May it please the Court.
