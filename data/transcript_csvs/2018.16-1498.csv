2018.16-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.76,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1498, Washington State Department of Licensing versus Cougar Den. Mr. Purcell."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,9.76,18.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Washington's fuel tax taxes fuel, not highway travel."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,38.44,39.68,I'm sorry.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,39.68,40.92,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,40.92,50.64,Could you tell me could you tax the tribe's buying of the fuel in another state?
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,50.64,51.6,"Well, the treaty --"
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,51.6,56.84,"They take the truck, they leave your state, they go to another state, they buy the fuel."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,60.2,63.16,"The other state could certainly tax them on that, Your Honor. They've conceded that."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,67.24,67.48,All right.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,67.48,68.44,-- but not -- certainly not under the treaty.
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.44,92.84,"So the question is, in my mind, whether the travel rights to freely use the highways permit you to tax them for an incidence carrying the fuel from another state on a highway through your state, correct? Now the court below called this an importation tax."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,92.84,93.44,Right.
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,93.44,97.32,"You've been resisting that, and you call it a use tax."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,97.32,97.8,Right.
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,97.8,109.2,"But, if it's an importation tax, it's not equally applied. There are wholesalers of all kind who can import without paying the tax, correct?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,109.2,111.36,"Not if they lack a license like Cougar Den, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,124.72,137.36,"What is the -- the license? Is it a way to get them not to pay? Who pays for the fuel then once you're licensed? You're a wholesaler, you bring it in, I'm assuming by vessel or by pipeline."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,137.36,139.52,"Well, then -- sorry. Sorry, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,139.52,143.52,"Then the person who buys the fuel uses it, correct?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,143.52,149.64,"Well, if you're bringing it into a terminal or refinery, then -- then the tax is due when it's picked up at a terminal or a refinery."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,158.48,194.56,"If we accept that the travel provision entitled this tribe to travel with goods back and forth to a market without a tax, without a license, just like in the fishing rights case, then what gives you the right to charge them within the state? Meaning they're traveling free of tax, free of license, they go to the reservation, you can't tax them on the reservation."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,194.56,194.96,Right.
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,194.96,199.28,So I'm not quite sure what permits you to tax them at all.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,199.28,200.4,"Well, there's two crucial --"
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,200.4,203.56,If you can't tax them when they picked up the fuel.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,203.56,205.04,"There's two crucial points about that, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,214.72,216.36,At the market.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,216.36,217.48,"At the market, yes, but -- but --"
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,217.48,222.08,"But you've just admitted that at the market where they pick this up, you couldn't tax them."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,222.08,226.24,"Well, the point is, Your Honor, the treaty did not preserve everything exactly as it was in 1855."
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,240.0,240.84,Mr. Purcell --
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,240.84,241.24,"Well, that --"
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,241.24,249.16,"-- there are a lot of issues in this case, but just to make it easier for me, could I ask you to assume a couple of them and then could -- we could focus on one?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,249.16,249.28,Sure.
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,249.28,258.32,"So you know one issue is does the right to travel include the right to travel with goods, and I'm going to ask you to just assume that it does."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,258.32,259.08,Okay.
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,259.08,268.76,"And then another question is, does this treaty preempt generally applicable taxes? And I'm -- that's -- you've been talking a lot about that."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,271.64,272.0,Okay.
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,272.0,282.92,"In other words, you know, if -- if -- if you have a toll on a road, for example, the fact that it's generally applicable, you still can't apply it to members of the Yakama Nation."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,283.76,283.92,Okay.
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,283.92,285.16,"-- to assume that, okay?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,285.16,285.6,Uh-huh.
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,285.6,321.68,"So, if both of those things are true, then it seems to me we come -- to me, the hardest issue, which is how do we look at this tax? Do we look at it as a tax that is preventing the Yakama from doing exactly what they bargained for in this treaty; in other words, it -- you know, it's not preventing but burdening the Yakama from traveling on roads with goods, or you keep on saying, well, no, because it's not targeted at that."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,355.28,356.72,"No, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,361.72,364.92,I know -- maybe I'm not making myself clear.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,399.12,423.24,"Because, Your Honor, this Court has never said that a person or a company can make an activity exempt from state law, an activity like fuel possession, by engaging in that activity while also engaged in a treaty-protected activity like travel. If that's the rule, then a Yakama member could possess illegal firearms or illegal drugs or diseased apples in their car, to just gave a range of examples, and bring them into the state and say your laws against these things violate my right to travel by public highway."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,427.08,451.88,"But even in the fishing rights case, which you don't see as -- as comparable, but others might argue it is, the state can regulate for public interest conservation points. The Indian tribe has conceded that you can regulate for public interest on a highway. That wasn't superseded by the treaty."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,471.6,480.64,"Your Honor, in Tulee, this Court said that the -- the state could not tax the very right at issue, the right to fish. But, here, that is not at all what's happening."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,480.64,482.68,Or impose a toll to do it.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,482.68,487.16,"Well, and the Court has never said that the state can generally regulate a fishing right in the public interest."
2018.16-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,490.64,492.28,"Well, that's the public interest."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,492.28,498.24,"Well, but -- but -- but Cougar Den is seeking to expand that to say the state can do anything that would protect public safety."
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,512.28,535.88,"Well, counsel, is that so? I mean, I thought the interpretation of the phrase ""in common with"" by the district court in Yakama Indian Nation was that it allowed the state to impose certain regulations that facilitate both native and non-native travel along the same highways."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,536.64,537.2,That's --
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,537.2,543.52,"-- safety regulations, speed limits, would facilitate travel in common."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,543.52,545.64,That's what the district court held in Yakama Indian Nation.
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,545.64,545.68,Right.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,545.68,551.0,"Of course, that wouldn't cover something like, for example, regulating firearm possession or diseased apple transportation."
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,551.0,557.36,"But it does regulate the questions that we've been talking about in terms of it does provide some safety regulations, for example, right?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,557.36,566.32,"Well, presumably, that would allow, for example, a speed limit but not any other sort of regulation on the goods themselves, which is what the state's trying to do here. I mean, what's odd under Cougar Den's theory is that the state --"
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,566.32,579.48,"That's all, under the Yakama Indian Nation holding, that's all that the treaty would allow you to do. And I guess I'm wondering in the first instance why -- why you're not estopped from arguing a different position today?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,579.48,581.24,"For a number of reasons, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,593.88,595.76,"Well, I -- I don't feel bound."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,597.72,598.32,"No, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,629.2,641.28,"But they were told at the time of the treaty that you could go on the roads to take your things to market, as if you would be treated off-reservation, as if you were still on the reservation."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,641.28,643.24,"The first part they were told, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,647.56,672.96,"But the effect -- the effect was that, in taking your goods to market, which was the promise, in exchange for a huge area of land, an area of land the size of the State of Maryland that was given up by the tribe, that you could take your goods to market. And this burdens, as Justice Kagan said, this burdens substantially their ability to take goods to market."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,672.96,682.36,"Your Honor, the Yakama remain entirely free to take goods to market. And Cougar Den has conceded that the state can tax their -- their trading of goods off-reservation, as they must."
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,690.44,704.88,"But what the treaty seems to present -- prevent is the state from taxing either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh says, travel with goods. Isn't that exactly what they got in exchange for their land?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,704.88,711.2,"No, Your Honor, the best reading of the treaty is that it does not preempt non-discriminatory taxes that apply equally to everyone."
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,743.92,779.24,"Well, the -- the tax legislation taxes a wide range of activities. One is it taxes fuel that's removed in the state from a refinery, but the one that's being applied here is that it taxes motor vehicle fuel entering into this state. So entering into, this is a pretty standard importation tax, which is to say that it's taxing the travel of goods into the state, which, again, seems to be what the Yakama got as a result of this treaty: the ability to take goods to market and to take goods from market, regardless where that market is."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,779.24,786.12,"But, again, Your Honor, the -- the fuel -- the tax applies to fuel purchased inside Washington and outside of Washington and brought into Washington by any means."
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,800.04,820.6,"Do you -- do you contest -- I mean, if you said what is Cougar Den doing, how would you describe what Cougar Den is doing, what its activity is? Because the way I would describe Cougar Den's activity is that it's bringing goods from market."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,820.6,822.2,"Well, two things about that, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,824.16,827.76,I just really asked how would you describe Cougar Den's activity.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,827.76,827.88,Sorry.
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,834.52,838.76,You would describe it as possessing fuel as opposed to transporting fuel?
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,838.76,840.72,They owe the tax because they possess fuel.
2018.16-1498,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,843.32,849.96,"So if Jack says I'm taking my pigs to market, and somebody says, what are you doing, Jack? He says, well, I'm taking my pigs to market."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,852.92,865.04,"Well, if the state had a rule that diseased pigs could not leave a certain area, under the -- under Crudenser, the state could not apply that rule. And -- and so this is a regulation of the goods, a tax to the goods, not a tax on the travel."
2018.16-1498,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,876.84,881.32,"That -- that reading of ""in common with"" was rejected by the Court in the fishing cases."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,881.32,884.52,"It was, Your Honor, but none of the reasons the Court gave in those cases apply here."
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,908.44,913.76,"Well, we -- counsel, we normally read a -- a -- a phrase to bear the same meaning in all of its applications."
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,921.76,922.4,Fair --
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,922.4,923.84,-- reading of a statutory term.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,923.84,927.2,"Fair enough, Your Honor, but in Tulee, this Court said it was sort of deviating from the normal meaning."
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,927.2,928.48,"What -- what -- what do you think about that, though?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,928.48,932.48,I think you had good reasons for deviating from the normal meaning in Tulee that do not apply here.
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,934.72,938.12,"But having adopted one reading of it, why wouldn't we be consistent?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,938.12,940.2,Because none of the reasons you gave in those cases apply here --
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,940.2,940.44,Okay.
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,940.44,941.72,-- the textual reasons and practical.
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,941.72,952.04,The next -- next concern would be then what do we do about the fact that this is also how the district court concluded it after very careful reading in Yakama Indian Nation about the history of the treaty --
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,952.04,952.44,"Well, it's the --"
2018.16-1498,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,952.44,972.16,"-- and looking at the original understanding of both parties and its original meaning at that time, and that the Indians understood it not to mean a common regulation applicable to everybody, but, again, that they would be able to do the same things that they've always done, just with non-native persons present?"
2018.16-1498,0,62975,noah_purcell,,972.16,975.48,"The meaning of the treaty, of course, is a question of law for this Court to decide de novo."
2018.16-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,990.4,993.08,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.16-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,995.32,996.56,I did that once too. Ms. O'Connell.
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,996.56,1010.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Article III of the Yakama treaty does not exempt tribal members from paying Washington's motor fuel tax. The treaty protects the right in common with others to travel upon the public highways."
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.64,1064.12,"Assume I think you're mostly right, but what about the fact that it's gasoline? I mean, can -- can the state impose tolls on -- on the highway? Say they really want people to use mass transit."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1068.56,1068.88,I don't --
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.88,1069.56,Can they do that?
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1069.56,1073.88,"The state -- well, the state could impose a $1,000 toll if it was doing that for everybody."
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.16,1074.88,"Yes, doing it for everybody."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1080.56,1085.04,I think that that hypothetical is quite unlikely simply because the -- there's --
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.04,1087.36,I believe that they are unlikely to impose it.
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1089.28,1093.48,There's -- there's an antidiscrimination rule built into --
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1093.48,1095.8,"No, no, everyone has to pay the thousand."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1095.8,1096.08,Right.
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1096.64,1102.28,"Including the tribe. And then, if you were going to say they can do that, I really do find it difficult to distinguish this issue."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1102.28,1104.84,"There -- there could be some restrictions, Justice Breyer, like --"
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.84,1105.04,There could?
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1105.04,1107.6,"-- if you imposed a, you know, a million dollar tax on everybody's use --"
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1107.6,1113.08,"No, no, it's $1,000, and, of course, as soon as you agree to that, I'm going to say it's only 50, and then I'm going to say it's 10."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1113.08,1113.4,Right.
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1113.4,1120.8,"And then, when I'm driving up, I would have thought they can't do that, but if they can't do that, this is gasoline."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1140.76,1148.2,I suppose there could be circumstances where the restriction that's placed on travel on the highway are so severe that it undermines --
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1148.2,1167.12,"In Oregon, you say that they have -- they cannot take steps to remove significant numbers of salmon from the steam -- stream, and they cannot take steps sufficient to significantly limit the right to travel on the highway by these people."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1170.32,1176.96,So I think there's a couple of distinctions that we need to -- to draw between what you're hypothesizing and what is happening here.
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.0,1187.2,How much is the tax?
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1187.2,1188.08,Excuse me?
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1188.08,1190.16,How much is the tax?
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1190.16,1192.52,"Well, we don't think that -- I mean, I -- I don't know."
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.52,1198.96,"I know you don't think it's relevant, but if I happened to think it was relevant and asked the question how much is the tax, what would the answer be?"
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1198.96,1199.4,I -- I don't have a --
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.4,1200.0,You don't know?
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1200.0,1200.72,-- a number to give you.
2018.16-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1205.32,1207.16,But they didn't make any of these arguments.
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1207.16,1246.12,"No, that's correct. And I think the other thing is, even if you thought that the treaty preempted things like fees to use the highway, such as a toll or a licensing fee that was issue -- at issue in Cree, so you adopted the Ninth Circuit's rule of what kinds of things are preempted, it still wouldn't preempt this tax, which isn't a fee to use the highway; it's a tax, an economic burden on the goods that are being carried in the truck. The -- the text of Article III secures to the -- the Yakamas only the right in common with others to travel upon the public highways. And that right, by its plain terms, doesn't protect activities other than highway travel. There's nothing in the negotiating history either that indicates --"
2018.16-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1246.12,1252.28,"Well, there's one central part, which is they traveled the highways for free."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1282.52,1289.8,"Well, I don't -- I don't think the state is ever going to impose a tax that is so burdensome that nobody can travel on the highways, but our -- yes, we believe that --"
2018.16-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1289.8,1300.84,"So you're going back to the point that Justice Gorsuch ended with, which is that you're reading ""in common with all others"" differently in this context than in the fishing rights context?"
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1300.84,1301.32,Yes.
2018.16-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1311.16,1325.4,"Well, the one difference that you can't get around is they didn't sign a treaty and give away that much real estate to get nothing in return, to be treated exactly like every other citizen in traveling the highway."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1325.4,1354.36,"No, I think one -- one thing that is really -- really important about this right to travel provision, the right to use the public highways, is that the -- the tribe was receiving an assurance from Governor Stevens that if they gave up the rest of the land in exchange for the reservation, they would still be able to leave the reservation, they would still be able to travel throughout the area, and that they would be able to do so without discrimination against them, without taxes imposed or without rules imposed that were unique to Indians."
2018.16-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1354.36,1357.8,You just said it: without taxes imposed.
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1357.8,1360.88,Without taxes imposed that were not applied to everybody else.
2018.16-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1360.88,1361.52,What kind of --
2018.16-1498,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1361.52,1362.24,It doesn't say that.
2018.16-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1362.24,1373.8,"-- what kind of promise is that? Given the constitutional rights to travel and equal protection, is that a -- is that a -- is that an illusory promise, the promise you've just described?"
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1373.8,1373.96,No.
2018.16-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1398.96,1400.16,Do you think any of that would hold up today?
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1400.16,1400.72,No.
2018.16-1498,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1400.72,1401.16,Okay.
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1401.16,1402.04,Certainly not.
2018.16-1498,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1405.0,1408.6,"The -- the purpose wasn't -- the purpose wasn't just to leave the reservation, though."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1417.76,1424.96,"I -- I don't think, Justice Kavanaugh, that -- that Respondent is even arguing that the trade can't be burdened once they leave the reservation."
2018.16-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1442.8,1451.72,"But I think what is at issue is the transport of goods to and from the market, which is what it seems the Yakama is engaging in here."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1451.72,1452.64,That's true.
2018.16-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1463.2,1488.12,"But if -- if I disagree with you on that -- and I hadn't understood that you were taking that position in your brief -- but if I disagree with you on that and I use -- and I understand ""in common with"" the way Tulee understood ""in common with,"" then it seems, well, there they are, they're doing what this treaty says that the -- that this -- they're doing exactly what this treaty protects, which is transporting goods to and from market."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1488.12,1505.6,"I think that, under that view, Justice Kagan, the -- the most you could get is to the Ninth Circuit's line where they've said that the state can't impose a fee like a licensing fee or a toll or something like that to use the highway, even if it's being imposed across the board. What's happening here is a different type of restriction."
2018.16-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1514.92,1521.28,"But not because of the -- but not at the movement point, not -- not when it -- the -- the goods go from one state to another on the highway."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1521.28,1521.48,Right.
2018.16-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1535.84,1543.84,"Well, it might be thin, but shouldn't we say that the state has to do things the right way, which is to say the state has to do things without violating the treaty."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1544.96,1550.8,I think the -- the state has tried many different ways to impose this tax that have been struck down by various courts.
2018.16-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1559.32,1566.24,"But what the state has done is to tax exactly the activity that's protected under the treaty, which is the -- which is the transportation of goods to and from market."
2018.16-1498,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1566.24,1584.12,"I -- I don't think so. There's -- I think there's a distinction between -- if you think that -- that the -- the tribe wouldn't be subject to a uniform tax if it taxed the very thing that they were trying to preserve, which was the ability to use the public highways, then that would just -- it would just mean that you couldn't charge them a fee to use the highway or something like that, not that you couldn't tax the goods that are in the truck."
2018.16-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1585.64,1588.16,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1588.16,1594.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Yakama treaty preempts the application of the fuel tax to Respondent for two reasons."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1626.44,1646.08,"So if -- if this -- these were apples coming into the State of Washington and there was a fee to -- but they inspected the apples to make sure they weren't diseased and the people who owned the apples had to pay that fee, is that problematic if it wasn't motor fuel, oil, but just apples, a fee to inspect the apples and prevent disease from spreading to other Washington apples?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1646.08,1648.08,"Your Honor, we wouldn't object to the inspection at all."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1652.24,1665.4,"Well, that's kind of the -- well, in other words, everybody else bringing apples in has to pay the fee to inspect the apples, but the tribe doesn't, even though -- or the -- the fee can't be assessed if the tribe is transporting the apples?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1665.4,1671.72,"Yeah, I think that if all the tribe is doing is transporting the apples, we absolutely agree the -- the apples can be inspected."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1675.28,1680.12,But -- but -- but no fee can be assessed if the tribe is transporting the apples?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1680.12,1689.16,"Yeah, I think that a fee that goes into the -- you know, the general treasury of the state cannot -- cannot be assessed on the tribe when they're exercising the treaty right."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1689.44,1696.12,"Even if the apples don't belong to the tribe? They're bringing them to somebody -- you know, they're just bringing them down the road?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1696.12,1699.24,"Well, it would depend on who has to pay the tax."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.96,1720.04,Yeah.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1720.04,1722.12,"-- but the state -- yeah, then I think that the --"
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1722.12,1724.2,Isn't that what's going on here? I thought --
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1724.2,1725.0,No.
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1725.0,1728.24,"-- it was the owner -- I thought it was the owner of the fuel that is taxed, not the --"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1728.24,1729.36,"Yes, that's Cougar Den."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1729.36,1729.88,-- not the transporter?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1729.88,1730.92,"Yes, that's Cougar Den, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1733.04,1741.28,"So it's not who owns -- it -- it's not a -- a separation between the goods and the transport, right?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1741.28,1761.8,"No, Your Honor, what the statute does is it says it's the transportation that's taxed, but the tax is imposed on the owner. So, if you hire someone in a truck to transport something for you, it makes perfect sense that the state wouldn't want the trucker to have to pay this tax which will probably exceed the fee he's getting for transporting it. So the state -- the statute imputes the act of transportation to the owner of the fuel."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1777.8,1784.08,"So -- so, if it's the owner, why do you -- why does it interfere with a right to travel?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1784.08,1788.36,"Well, it's -- it's the -- it's the owner's transportation either itself or via an agent."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1812.4,1820.96,"Does it make a difference -- I think this is the argument on the other side -- that it's assessed per gallon, in other words, that suggests as opposed to per mile that you're carrying it?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1820.96,1821.04,No.
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1821.04,1827.36,It suggests that it's -- it's based on possession if it's based on right there at that moment how much do you have.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1836.48,1839.48,"Well, I don't agree -- I don't think that you can just say a tax is on a good."
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1887.56,1897.24,"But what if the -- I mean, what if the statute said the first entity to possess the fuel in the state must pay the tax?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1897.24,1901.28,"So we would still say that's preempted, although our legal analysis might differ a little bit."
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1901.28,1902.68,Why would that be preempted?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1902.68,1917.96,"Well, first of all, I think that, as applied to fuel that comes in from out of state, really, first possession just is inherently importation. In other words, you can't be the first possessor of fuel, at least that originates out of state, unless you're the one hauling it into the state. So, in that context, I just think first possession kind of means it."
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1917.96,1926.8,"Well, I thought you just said we have to focus on what the statute says is being taxed, so if the statute says expressly possession is being taxed, that doesn't matter."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1926.8,1927.4,Okay.
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1946.0,1949.96,"Well, then that's very artificial and you get into this metaphysical question of what they're doing."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1964.4,1988.16,"Well, yeah, but I think that things that are inherent in transportation, like breathing while you're transporting it, I think would be sort of wrapped up in transportation. I mean, on the facts of this case, what we have here is an Indian distributor transporting fuel to an Indian reservation to be sold to an Indian retailer on the reservation and potentially to Indian customers. Really, the only connection that Cougar Den has off-reservation is that it's hauling this fuel."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.16,1998.04,"The -- the thing I don't understand is that many states have laws against bringing in diseased apples, all kinds of things."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2015.68,2016.44,"Yes, that is our argument, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.44,2016.68,Okay.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2056.92,2058.16,"No, it is not our position."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.84,2059.0,Good.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2063.08,2066.88,But I'd like -- I'd like -- like to -- I'd like to know what your position is then.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2066.88,2069.0,We are not claiming exemption from sales taxes.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.76,2078.28,So especially for gas?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2078.28,2079.48,"Yeah, so if you buy --"
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.48,2080.8,I didn't see that in your brief.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2087.96,2089.0,That -- that's not our position.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.0,2089.72,That's not your argument either.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2089.72,2090.84,Our position is not based on the fact that it's --
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.84,2090.84,Okay.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2091.76,2100.68,"Our argument is that if you buy fuel and the state imposes a sales tax, as Your Honor referred to, then the acquisition of a good -- it could be fuel, it could be apples, it could be anything -- that could be taxed."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.88,2120.56,What do you mean the transportation? Does it say it taxes the transportation?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2120.56,2121.2,I think it does.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.32,2122.6,It does?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2122.6,2123.16,-- taxable --
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2123.16,2125.2,You know the statute better than I.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2130.44,2133.0,"Your Honor, I'll tell you the words of the statute and then what the state court said."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2133.0,2134.36,"What's the answer, yes or no?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2134.36,2140.56,"It doesn't use the word transport, but the state court said it taxes transportation, and the state court authoritatively construes state statutes."
2018.16-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2140.56,2141.52,"Well, it uses the word enter."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.52,2141.88,What is the word?
2018.16-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2141.88,2142.0,Enter is a --
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2142.0,2143.84,"Yeah, it uses enter. It says entry of fuel."
2018.16-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2143.84,2144.24,It's a movement.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2144.24,2146.68,"The taxpayer is ""the importer,"" and the state court --"
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.68,2149.04,"No, what is the word of the statute?"
2018.16-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2149.04,2149.44,Enter.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2149.44,2151.28,That is the taxable entry into the state.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.28,2152.12,You get a tax.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2155.28,2155.76,Yes.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.76,2164.76,"A tax is imposed of 90 percent when marijuana enters this state, and you just told me that would be okay."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2164.76,2169.76,The taxpayer is defined as the importer and the state court construed the statute as a tax on transportation.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.76,2175.32,An importer of marijuana must pay a tax of 90 percent.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2175.32,2175.52,Yes.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.08,2177.72,You say that is legal or illegal?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2177.72,2179.8,I think if it was a tax on marijuana --
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.8,2181.16,I just -- what I just said.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2181.16,2182.4,I don't see a different between marijuana --
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.4,2182.92,Is it legal or illegal?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2182.92,2185.2,"If it was just a tax, it probably would be illegal, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.2,2186.8,You heard what I said.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2199.76,2199.96,Yes.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.76,2205.0,All right.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2248.28,2248.32,All right.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.0,2249.32,Yes.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2249.32,2257.44,"The first answer is, if it's truly a regulatory fine, if it's like you can't possess marijuana and we are punishing you, then we don't view that as a tax."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.24,2258.68,All right.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2258.68,2263.96,"I think that, you know, the distinction between taxes and fines might in some cases be difficult to identify. Not in this case."
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2265.56,2273.04,So where do you get the difference between a regulation and a -- and -- and a tax under the words of the treaty?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2273.04,2276.8,So I -- so we're following this Court's decision in Tulee and Yakama Indian Nation.
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2300.2,2304.44,Where does that come from? There's -- you -- you -- you prohibit certain things.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2307.04,2312.6,"Well, so this is the line the Court drew in the Tulee case with respect to the fishing clause and in the Puyallup case."
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2337.84,2346.72,"If an off-reservation sales tax is okay, as you say it is, why is an off-reservation possession tax not okay?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2346.72,2348.96,"Well, I don't think this is a possession tax, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2351.04,2352.4,Suppose it is a possession tax.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2353.56,2355.28,So we -- we have a broader argument --
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2355.28,2356.76,An off-reservation possession tax?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2356.76,2359.16,So we have a broader argument in our brief and a narrower one.
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2372.12,2376.04,"That seems to be an argument that it's a sham, that it's really getting to transportation."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2382.24,2398.68,"So I think, under the broadest possible version of our argument, we probably -- but I'm not going to push this very hard -- I think it would be preempted, but I'm not going to push it very hard because I think that this really is a transportation tax. I think it's actually quite helpful to look at why the statute is written the way it is, to understand why we really think this is a transportation tax."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2436.88,2450.92,"Well, what if you have the -- the tank where the fuel is going to go in is -- is right by the border and it's a tax on fuel that goes into the tank? They don't care what you do with it; you can transport it, you can -- whatever you want to do with it."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2473.52,2476.4,I understand that overall the state just wants the money in some sense.
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.32,2490.24,"No, I'm talking about my hypothetical tax, okay? It -- as soon as it goes into a tank, not one of the tanker trucks, then it's taxed on that."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2499.56,2507.08,"Well, if you're referring to like taking the -- the fuel from the truck and putting it into a big tank off the reservation at the border, if that's the hypothetical --"
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2507.08,2509.8,A non- -- non-Indian truck.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2509.8,2513.08,"Yeah, that -- if that's the hypothetical, then that wouldn't be transportation."
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.88,2525.12,It doesn't say transportation.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2525.12,2526.24,-- it's a different one.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.24,2530.76,"It says bulk entry or something like that, non-bulk entry."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2588.12,2595.2,"Yeah, I'm happy to. So on -- on the hypothetical of buying things online, I think it would depend on how the statute defined the taxable event."
2018.16-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2619.48,2628.16,Incidence is -- you're -- you're shipping -- shipping something into the state from out of state.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2635.88,2637.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2648.12,2651.96,But it's a shipment of goods into our state.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2665.12,2672.2,"I think that, again, this Court has really drawn a -- has not really talked about in terms of a tax on goods."
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2688.2,2688.6,Suppose the --
2018.16-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2688.6,2689.0,Mr. Unikowsky --
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2689.0,2705.0,"-- suppose the fuel arrives by tanker and it is taxed when it reaches the -- the port of Seattle, but everybody knows that, at that point, it's going to be transferred to trucks owned by Cougar Den."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2706.72,2707.68,That would not be preempted.
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2713.24,2715.96,"Well, suppose it's somebody in the tribe."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2715.96,2717.08,"Even so, I don't think so."
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2719.32,2720.88,Why -- why would it not be?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2720.88,2723.92,Because the taxable transaction isn't the transportation of the fuel.
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2736.48,2744.04,Why does it matter whether it arrives by sea or across the border from Oregon?
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2744.04,2749.56,"Well, if the -- if the relevant taxable event is the entry into a port by a --"
2018.16-1498,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2749.56,2755.2,"If the relevant taxable event is the possession, the first possession within the border of Washington?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2755.2,2762.96,"Well, it depends -- in that scenario where it arrives by a tanker truck, the first possessor is someone who's using a big boat and is not traveling on public highways."
2018.16-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2776.24,2776.8,Mr. Unikowsky --
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2776.8,2777.0,Yes.
2018.16-1498,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2777.0,2802.4,"-- it seems to me you can look at this in one of two ways, and which way you look at it, in part, you know, suggests who should win. The first is you -- you could say: What is the taxpayer here doing? Is what the taxpayer here doing within the terms of the treaty? And there, it just seems to me that you win because what the taxpayer is doing is transporting goods to and from market."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2859.56,2861.52,"So, of course, I think it's the activity."
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2950.8,2951.64,"Counsel, do you --"
2018.16-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2951.64,2967.04,"But these retailers -- these are off-reservation -- the retailers of the fuel, they are off-reservation or on-reservation?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2967.04,2969.04,The retailers are exclusively on the reservation.
2018.16-1498,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2978.36,2985.48,"And they sell to not people, not exclusively people on the reservation, right?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2985.48,2986.08,That's true.
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.68,3008.12,I'm not talking about non-Indians.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3062.76,3066.92,"That's not exactly our position because there was a few other things that have to be true. So, first of all, the tax --"
2018.16-1498,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.92,3076.88,"Yes, it also, by the way, has to be the case that it goes by FedEx or it goes by UPS or it goes by a truck or something like that."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3083.2,3086.92,"So, again, we have a broader argument and a narrower argument."
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3133.12,3135.76,"The language of the treaty does not distinguish, though --"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3135.76,3136.4,That's correct.
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3136.4,3137.84,-- between the ceded area and the other areas.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3137.84,3144.12,"So the textual hook for that would be the word ""secured,"" which this Court has construed as requiring looking at what they already possessed when --"
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3144.12,3154.76,"And another question, which is your -- your position depends on disaggregating possession and transportation, but you could possess something without transporting."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3166.08,3169.2,"Well, first of all, I think that in many ways these are state law questions."
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3186.88,3191.84,"So, if a state court construed it differently from this state court, you would have a different position?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3191.84,3240.2,"I mean, I think I'd probably still try to argue preemption, but I think it would be much harder than the argument I'm currently making to you today, because the Court has held that the incidence of the tax is a question of state law. It just seems to me that if -- if the state court is saying that this is a transportation tax, and transportation is treaty-protected activity, it just kind of follows like almost, like, inevitably that there's -- there's preemption because, you know, you're taxing treaty-protected activity based on the statute as it's authoritatively construed by the state court. I just would like to say one thing about why I think that, you know, this -- what the state is doing here is quite inconsistent with what I think the expectation of the tribe would have been in 1855, because the tribe was actually specifically concerned about transporting fuel along this route, right? And so Governor Stephens promised in the treaty minutes, you can take your goods to market to the river, which is a reference to the Columbia River."
2018.16-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3306.76,3321.84,"Does it mean anything that this tax is literally on traveling the route, importing by a highway? There is no similar tax on importation by licensed people."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3326.48,3326.8,Yes.
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3343.72,3348.56,"Well, you want to characterize it as a transport tax, and the statute doesn't say that either."
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3348.56,3351.64,"Well, I think that the state court is responsible for construing state law."
2018.16-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3367.96,3370.64,The problem is it's not consistent.
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3374.84,3375.0,Yeah.
2018.16-1498,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3401.2,3408.12,"To state the obvious, the value, current value of the land the tribe gave up is enormous, right?"
2018.16-1498,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3408.12,3411.48,"It's a third of the State of Washington, I believe, Your Honor. Thank you."
2018.16-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.48,3416.72,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Purcell."
2018.16-1498,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3416.72,3430.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to point out two crucial facts about what will happen if you accept Cougar Den's position. First to Justice Breyer's point, if you accept their position, Yakama members can transport goods nationwide without taxation or regulation."
2018.16-1498,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3434.28,3435.08,They don't have a treaty with everybody.
2018.16-1498,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3435.08,3437.04,"They have a treaty with the United States, Your Honor."
2018.16-1498,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3461.12,3468.8,"But on -- on that one, didn't Mr. Unikowsky say, consistent with our case law, that there's a difference between taxation and regulation?"
2018.16-1498,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3468.8,3471.0,And -- and that's just a misrepresentation of the case law.
2018.16-1498,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3547.64,3553.64,Has Washington considered taxing non-tribal members for their purchases on tribal lands?
2018.16-1498,3,62975,noah_purcell,,3553.64,3559.76,"Your Honor, that is the system that we had before we adopted this system, and it was struck down by a federal court in Washington."
2018.16-1498,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3624.96,3625.56,"Thank you, counsel."
