1993.92-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,61.039,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-1168, Teresa Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. Mr. Venick, we'll hear from you."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,61.039,64.322,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,159.285,166.289,Do you take the position that there should be no requirement of proof of subjective effect?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,166.289,171.343,"Your Honor, it's our position that there is a subjective element in the unwelcomeness requirement."
1993.92-1168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,171.343,171.659,Yes.
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,171.659,184.984,"But beyond that, in this particular case, Your Honor, there were findings that there was both subjective harm, and that Ms. Harris was also subjected to conduct that would have offended a reasonable person in her position, so that's not a question that this Court needs to reach in this case."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.008,254.591,Mr. Venick--
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,254.591,255.191,"--Yes, Your Honor?"
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.191,265.547,"--with respect to those comments that you just quoted, does the sexual harassment caption really fit those?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,277.02,285.21,"Your Honor, those comments may be characterized more properly as sex-based comments, but still we believe fall within the sexual harassment--"
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.21,292.864,Hasn't the EEOC picked up on word gender to try to distinguish that kind of comment from the sexual harassment?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,292.864,306.922,"--They have, Your Honor, and in addition, in their 1990 guidelines, the EEOC sets forth a separate category which it characterizes as sex-based comments, but does not remove them from its general rules regarding the analysis of a sexual harassment case."
1993.92-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.29,326.935,"Mr. Venick, suppose I'm a male employee and I am as offended by language and conduct like that as a female employee, or as offended by the posting of really scatological pictures and whatnot around the workplace, do I have a claim?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,332.655,338.726,"--Under the wording of title VII, Your Honor, I don't believe you would, because you're not being discriminated because of your sex."
1993.92-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.63,347.582,Is she being discriminated against because of her sex?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,356.438,363.442,Title VII protects employees against discrimination as to the terms and conditions in their employment because of their sex.
1993.92-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.588,392.961,"So it would be different if Charles Hardy had been equally scathing and offensive to men, calling them dumb-ass men?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,392.961,400.717,"I believe in that case, Your Honor, if he treated everyone equally, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe Teresa Harris may not have had a claim."
1993.92-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.717,403.617,He wouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex.
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,403.617,406.052,"That's right, because he's not discriminating on the basis of sex."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,408.302,410.504,Some of these are hard to transpose in that way.
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,415.324,416.824,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.017,437.571,"Mr. Venick, you've never had anybody tell you, you're a man, what do you know?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,442.123,448.879,--Well--
1993.92-1168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,467.138,476.678,"Just before we leave this point, suppose there are sex-based comments in the workplace generally among men."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,489.953,499.609,"Your Honor, I don't believe in that case that specific factual situation would fall within the sex-based criterion under Meritor."
1993.92-1168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.365,518.255,"Well, you certainly could have a hostile working environment that makes it very difficult for the female employee to continue to work there, couldn't you, under those circumstances?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,518.255,521.707,"If the conduct, Your Honor, is directed towards the female employee--"
1993.92-1168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,521.707,528.861,"No, that wasn't the assumption, but it nonetheless creates a hostile working environment."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,528.861,539.383,"--If the conduct is found under Meritor to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of that employee's work environment, yes, that would be a hostile work environment."
1993.92-1168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,539.383,544.168,What is the reasonable person standard that we employ?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,562.296,565.832,"Well, Justice O'Connor, there is a great deal of confusion in the lower courts about that standard."
1993.92-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.197,625.286,"Well, I don't see why it should necessarily be the reasonable woman, reasonable victim, as you put it, rather than the reasonable employer."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,625.286,632.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, the reasonable employer is the person who is perpetrating the conduct."
1993.92-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.357,649.717,"Well, that's what we're trying to find out, and one way we will find out differently, depending on what test is applied, is whether you say, is it a reasonable employer or a reasonable victim?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,649.717,657.905,"--Mr. Chief Justice, title VII is intended by its very language to protect employees from discriminatory conduct in the workplace."
1993.92-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.591,665.828,It doesn't define from whose focus discrimination is to be considered.
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,665.828,678.802,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but the focus of the statute is to protect employees, and it would therefore seem in our view that the perspective should be from the perspective of the plaintiff or the victim."
1993.92-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,678.802,692.728,"Well, you have any number of personal injury statutes... that are designed to protect employees, but the standard of negligence is not the standard of a reasonable employee but the standard of a reasonable person."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,692.728,703.584,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and a number of the amici that have filed briefs have pointed out one of the problems with the reasonableness standard, and that is that it's not found expressly in the language of title VII."
1993.92-1168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,723.998,726.867,"Of course, I have trouble with this whole debate."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,763.421,769.658,"Your Honor, that would create a problem in the context of this case, because Mr. Hardy believed that he was acting reasonably."
1993.92-1168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,772.008,773.36,"Well, but he might have been very wrong."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,775.043,778.078,"--We would hope he might be found to have been very wrong, but--"
1993.92-1168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.078,780.03,"And it's not his subjective belief, is it?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,787.553,799.343,"--That's correct, if his conduct is found to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the working environment, and it's our view that that perspective needs to be from the perspective of the employee, because it's the employee who's subjected to the conduct."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,809.032,829.594,"You're positing a reasonable employer who has been educated and made aware, not... for example, a reasonable employer in the old days might have thought it was perfectly fine to say all kinds of unpleasant things to women."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,842.419,870.487,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, but even in the situation where all employers are presumed to know the law, as Charles Hardy was presumed to know the law, they ofttimes, or sometimes don't act in accordance with the law, and that's why, from our perspective, it's the employee who has the interest in bringing forth actions under title VII to enforce the law, and that's why from our view that is the employee's perspective, if the Court's going to reach that point, that should be utilized in analyzing these facts."
1993.92-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.682,924.657,"Mr. Venick, you were going to tell us why the respondent, although purporting to concede the psychological injury point, in fact does not concede it."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,926.823,928.942,"I'll do that right now, Your Honor."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,976.554,979.123,--How do you define interfere with work performance?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,979.123,985.861,"Your Honor, we don't believe that that test is necessary for a finding of hostile work environment."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1003.49,1006.608,How about just saying it makes the job more difficult for the person?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1006.608,1021.284,"--Again, we would need to, in that case, Your Honor, try to quantify what that difficulty is, and we harken back to the language in Meritor that title... hostile environment cases don't involve tangible or economic injury."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.284,1035.877,"How about if you take a similarly situated man and a woman, and the woman is constantly told, you're a woman, you think like a woman, and her coworker is not told those things?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1041.781,1047.685,We don't believe it is necessarily more complex if the conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive.
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1055.755,1061.758,"You're talking about terms and conditions of employment, and the terms and conditions aren't equal if one is being called names and the other isn't."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1061.758,1067.662,"That's correct, Your Honor, but we don't believe you have to go any further and put a label on it, making it more difficult for her to do that job."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1073.233,1077.537,"You would seem to be developing a more complex test, and I was wondering why?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1081.239,1084.191,"--That's the language in Meritor, Your Honor, which we heartily embrace."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.191,1085.224,--I asked you what you thought it meant.
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1085.224,1094.83,"In evaluating whether conduct is severe or pervasive, one would look through the factors that have been adopted by most of the courts of appeals in the EEOC--"
1993.92-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.83,1099.032,But you said sufficiently severe to alter the conditions of employment.
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1112.338,1122.444,"--The factors, Your Honor, that would be applied to make a determination, is how often does the conduct occur, whose perpetrating the conduct, who else was exposed to the conduct, who else joined into the conduct?"
1993.92-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.444,1125.979,"All right, those are all factors, but how many of them do you need to alter the conditions?"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1125.979,1128.097,That is a determination--
1993.92-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.097,1128.48,How can you tell?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1144.44,1153.762,--The interference with work performance test would require a plaintiff to quantifiably prove some reduction in job performance which goes beyond--
1993.92-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.762,1154.912,Which is identifiable.
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1154.912,1156.898,--Which... but it also goes beyond--
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1156.898,1161.035,"Are you saying you have to show that the quality of work is different, that--"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1161.035,1162.552,"--That's what that... excuse me, Your Honor."
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1162.552,1166.337,"--That the output is different, and--"
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1166.337,1166.837,That's what that--
1993.92-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1166.837,1167.12,--that's the test to do it?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1167.12,1169.872,"--We're not positing that test, Your Honor."
1993.92-1168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1170.672,1176.526,You're not positing it because you don't... you would have us adopt a test without any subjective element at all.
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1176.526,1180.411,"--We believe that the Court can do that, Your Honor."
1993.92-1168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1180.411,1181.161,I thought you said--
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1188.481,1188.814,That is--
1993.92-1168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1188.814,1189.33,Didn't you say that?
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1189.33,1190.497,"--Yes, I did, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1168,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1190.497,1201.288,"But the... as I understand your view, the employee would not have to prove that job performance was in fact affected deleteriously."
1993.92-1168,0,28723,irwin_venick,,1201.288,1203.222,"That is correct, Justice Souter."
1993.92-1168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1208.525,1209.392,"Thank you, Mr. Venick."
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1210.811,1224.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1254.923,1260.208,"Do you have both an objective and a subjective component to ""make more difficult""?"
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1260.208,1262.827,"For that standard, Your Honor, we have only an objective component."
1993.92-1168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1271.064,1273.949,Why isn't that predicating liability with an injury?
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1283.906,1284.239,No.
1993.92-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.165,1307.502,"I take it the unwelcome component of the test, which is not involved here, is to satisfy some subjective--"
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1307.502,1308.604,That is correct.
1993.92-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1308.604,1312.822,"--requirement, and makes this not just like negligence in the act."
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1312.822,1321.328,"Yes, that is correct, and... but the issue in this case is the question of severity or pervasiveness, trying to understand what that concept means in the workplace."
1993.92-1168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1321.328,1338.224,"And the remedy could be simply, stop it, without any... talking about somebody who says the job is more difficult for me to perform than the next guy... not asking for any money, and just says, the remedy is an injunctive order to stop it."
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1338.224,1339.257,That is exactly correct.
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.347,1353.28,What other way is there to prove it?
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1362.469,1363.836,"Well, what we are--"
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.836,1364.586,--What else is there besides that?
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1364.586,1367.621,"--Oh, this is a matter of proof for the plaintiff, but suppose in fact--"
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.621,1368.021,I know that.
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1369.071,1372.74,--Suppose the plaintiff had clinical psychosis as a result of a rape in the workplace.
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.2,1394.568,"No, the question is, sufficiently to what, that's what the question is, sufficiently to what?"
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1402.906,1403.774,--Well--
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.774,1406.46,"One is, sufficiently to produce psychological injury, okay."
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1408.912,1409.378,--Yes.
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.145,1410.645,What else?
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1410.645,1418.799,"--Another example would be, for instance, let's take the concrete example of a woman who drives a taxicab for a taxi company, and she wants to work in the shop."
1993.92-1168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1435.01,1441.597,"Mr. Minear, what about the woman who doesn't see herself as a victim, but finds this terribly annoying."
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1451.003,1452.972,She does have a claim under those circumstances.
1993.92-1168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1455.257,1460.328,"--So even though she proves no psychological harm, and that she has been able to do the job as well, indeed, better than her coworkers--"
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1460.328,1461.444,--That is correct.
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1479.869,1485.607,"--Even if it's only mildly offensive, so it's not severe enough... it's just mildly offensive, but it's offensive."
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1485.607,1489.475,"Well, that's captured by our notion of a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff."
1993.92-1168,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1509.953,1527.681,"So your difficulty in doing the job is simply a... is an objective test, and the failure of an employee to work as well under this discriminatory atmosphere as without it is simply relevant evidence, it's not an element of anything."
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1527.681,1533.735,"That could be relevant evidence, yes, and in fact we think the correct standard was stated by the court below in the racial harassment context."
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.594,1556.379,"You don't really mean more difficult to do the job, you mean more unpleasant to work there, is what you mean by more difficult to do the job."
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1556.379,1558.248,"Well, that can make the job more difficult to do."
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.248,1560.2,"So why don't you just say that, more unpleasant to work there?"
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1567.171,1580.78,"I think that it's helpful to look in response to this to the facts of this actual case, and the United States and the EEOC believes that the sex-based abuse that occurred in this case provides an example of enjoinable harassment."
1993.92-1168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.905,1622.523,I'm puzzled by the more difficult to do the job.
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1643.901,1647.353,"--Well, keep in mind, Your Honor... yes, there is a violation, and it is--"
1993.92-1168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.353,1649.138,Without it being more difficult--
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1649.138,1653.257,"--and again, this goes back to my point of saying that this is not the exclusive test, that there are other ways."
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1656.376,1659.328,"--You don't mean more difficult to do the job, you mean more unpleasant--"
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1661.028,1661.444,"I mean, Your Honor--"
1993.92-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.444,1662.011,--is all you mean.
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1663.863,1667.732,"--Again, let's go back to... again, the ultimate touchstone here is whether it alters working conditions."
1993.92-1168,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1672.902,1675.354,Whether one sex has to put up with something that the other sex doesn't have to put up with.
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1675.354,1680.657,"That's right, but it can also make it more difficult to do the job, and in terms of Teresa Harris'--"
1993.92-1168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.54,1714.177,I wonder if alter the environment is the happiest way of putting it.
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1725.334,1735.09,"That might be correct, but the question here is, I think we're looking in a more global sense of whether there is different treatment for women and men in the workplace."
1993.92-1168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1735.09,1738.911,"Which really doesn't depend on altered treatment at all, does it?"
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1738.911,1748.867,"Not necessarily, again, it doesn't, and that's why I think it's helpful, again as a benchmark here, to ask whether women and men are being treated differently in terms of whether or not it makes it more difficult to do the job."
1993.92-1168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1749.533,1751.05,What about some sort of de minimis?
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1755.771,1764.376,"--That is why we think that a reasonable person standard is appropriate in this context, and there was some discussion before about whether we looked to the reasonable woman, the reasonable victim, the reasonable man."
1993.92-1168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.244,1775.934,"Well, Mr. Minear, if the employer just makes it more difficult for everybody to do the job, male or female--"
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1775.934,1777.867,Then there is no gender--
1993.92-1168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.867,1778.469,--is there a complaint?
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1778.952,1779.602,--Then there--
1993.92-1168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1779.602,1780.286,--cause of action?
1993.92-1168,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1780.286,1786.456,"--In that situation there is no gender-based discrimination, and so the first factor in Meritor is not satisfied."
1993.92-1168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.242,1788.592,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,1790.694,1794.729,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1168,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1844.642,1864.14,"But he... didn't he do that, and isn't the difficulty with your argument both on this and other quotes that you make, that the magistrate did this in the course of a paragraph in which... and I'm referring, by the way to pages A-35... A-33 and 34 of the appendix."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,1898.111,1928.396,"If we take the fact that all offensive conduct and all things that may be characterized as harassment are not... do not enable you to seek redress under title VII, which is what the Meritor case says, there are acts that can be characterized as harassment but don't rise to the level of allowing you to obtain successfully redress for what you complain of."
1993.92-1168,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1942.056,1947.793,"Excuse me, are you referring to the joint appendix, to some page in it, or to the petition, or what?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,1947.793,1949.829,"--Yes, A-33 of the appendix, excuse me."
1993.92-1168,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1949.829,1951.545,"Well, this is the cert appendix."

1993.92-1168,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1952.614,1953.131,Of certiorari.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,1954.331,1956.566,"It's the cert petition, A-33."
1993.92-1168,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.566,1957.116,Thank you.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,1957.116,1957.749,Excuse me.
1993.92-1168,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1959.934,1960.734,"Yes, thank you."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,1960.734,1964.254,"At A-33 he says,"
1993.92-1168,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1986.935,1996.374,"Right, but doesn't the positioning of these sentences indicate that he thinks he's applying one element of the test, not two different tests or two different elements?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,1996.374,2001.576,"Well, I... that is not the way I read it, because when he starts the next paragraph, which is a new thought--"
1993.92-1168,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.576,2007.931,"If there's any doubt about that, we should send it back, shouldn't we, if we don't accept the psychological injury test?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2007.931,2020.572,--If there is any doubt in this Honorable Court's mind as to whether the magistrate focused clearly on all of the tests that have been enunciated as opposed to focusing on the psychological injury test--
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2020.572,2038.368,"Mr. Chernau, the magistrate set out... and this is A-29 and A-30 of the appendix to the petition for certiorari... set out marching orders from the Sixth Circuit and one of those, number 4, says,"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2063.768,2068.803,"--No, I don't believe that he's free to ignore it, and indeed, I don't believe he did ignore it."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2083.194,2097.303,"But you agree that the Sixth Circuit has said this is not merely a sufficient condition for liability, it's a necessary condition, part of plaintiff's proof... plaintiff must prove serious psychological well-being."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2097.303,2097.886,--Yes.
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2097.886,2104.107,"So if that's the law of the Sixth Circuit, mustn't we assume that that's what the magistrate applied?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2104.107,2108.225,"Yes, but I don't think that it's... you necessarily have to assume that he stopped at that point."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2114.963,2118.95,Where do you find a clear statement that there's an alternative ruling in this case?
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2118.95,2129.388,"--I don't believe that he used the word, alternative, but in reading at A-34 and A-35, particularly I think at A-35, where he says,"
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.52,2207.638,"Well, he at least said that it had to affect work performance, isn't that right?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2207.638,2208.304,--Yes.
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.304,2212.142,And your opponent contends that that isn't even necessary.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2212.142,2212.875,That's correct.
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2212.875,2216.327,Just making a more unpleasant work environment is enough.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2216.327,2219.445,"Yes, and interesting enough, Your Honor, is that the--"
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.445,2220.195,Do you disagree with that?
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2220.195,2223.481,--I agree that that's what the petitioner asserts.
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.481,2223.964,Right.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2223.964,2236.055,"And I say to you that the EEOC... we agree with the EEOC, who says that the standard should be related to work performance, that the EEOC and my side of the case agree."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2242.209,2245.994,"Mr. Chernau, this magistrate said this is a close case."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2275.68,2277.013,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2277.013,2288.552,"--If one concentrates on, I believe this is a close case, and then the judge is told, well, the standard is easier for the plaintiff to meet than you think, then wouldn't the close case tip the other way?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2288.552,2336.135,"I believe that when he stated this was a close case, that what he was talking about was the totality of the case, all of the circumstances, the credibility of the witnesses... as we all know, events don't take place in a vacuum, and I think that one of the really helpful things that comes out of Meritor, in addition to the test that it states, is the totality of circumstance statement, where Meritor says that you have to look to the totality of the circumstances, that the trier of fact must determine the existence of sexual harassment in light of the record as a whole, and the totality of circumstances such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.254,2344.722,"Why is it... the magistrate made a finding,"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2360.481,2378.859,"--He has found a continuing pattern of derogatory conduct, and he is trying to determine from all of the facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and he went to events that are extrinsic to the simple words that were said, and what the petitioner says, how they affected her."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2394.385,2396.004,He didn't make any finding on that.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2429.125,2439.599,"--I think that when you try to... in order to answer... that is a very difficult question to ask... to answer, because one racial epithet, it's been ruled as not enough."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.099,2444.401,"Well, there was not one epithet here, there was a whole series of them."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2444.401,2449.436,"--Yes, that is true, but what I was going to say is that I can't give you a mathematical formula, but I can again--"
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2449.436,2451.388,I haven't asked you for a formula.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2477.853,2482.573,--My answer to that question is that I believe that is the same.
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2482.573,2488.061,"So that the Monsanto test that the... I think it was the Sixth Circuit, wasn't it?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2488.061,2490.577,I believe the Monsanto was the Sixth Circuit.
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2490.577,2490.861,Yes.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2493.965,2512.942,"I believe that that's accurate, and I agree that they shouldn't be distinguished, but again I state that if you go to the Meritor case, the Meritor case refers to the gauntlet of sexual harassment, sexual demeaning remarks, so it's not only whatever happens... the Meritor case recognizes this."
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2528.602,2539.744,"Mr. Chernau, why do you say that the test affecting work performance, which you're proposing, is the same test the EEOC proposes?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2541.077,2541.779,"Well, because--"
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.779,2546.731,"I mean, I thought... I was listening to Mr. Minear, and I think what Mr. Minear's saying is it doesn't have to affect work performance."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2551.901,2552.968,--The EEOC--
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.968,2554.52,You say it has to affect performance.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2554.52,2559.574,--The EEOC states a sexually... this is in their brief at page 25.
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2565.644,2570.363,"It can, and that would certainly be enough, but I'm not... I don't understand them to say that's a prerequisite."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2570.363,2596.33,"Well, they state in describing... well, the focus... I believe that the EEOC's position is this: that the focus of title VII is on the employment opportunity and whether or not the party complains employment opportunity... that is to succeed and to do the job--"
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.33,2597.113,I don't think--
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2597.113,2598.282,--is adversely affected.
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.282,2599.282,--I don't think they agree with that.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2614.309,2616.059,"Well, the fact--"
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2616.059,2617.242,"You disagree with that, right?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2619.075,2619.575,--Yes.
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.558,2657.164,"Suppose a union negotiates a contract and the contract says, we will have Muzak piped in to the... that's one of the conditions of employment."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2664.668,2668.02,"And I believe that's offensive, but I don't believe--"
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2672.757,2674.124,"I think you missed my point, Mr.--"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2674.657,2682.712,--I don't believe it rises to the level where the law is intended to protect you and give you redress.
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2682.712,2696.889,"Mr. Chernau, I just wanted to make sure that Davis v. Monsanto is indeed... you told me that yes, that standard would be the same, and one of the things the Sixth Circuit said in that 1988 decision was,"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2712.232,2731.36,"Yes, and in regard to the tangible, the magistrate found that she... indeed, the petitioner suffered no injury, he said, of any kind whatsoever, whether it be tangible or intangible, that really she didn't... she wasn't adversely affected."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2731.36,2732.244,I'm not sure that you understood my question.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2748.071,2765.181,"Well, I may have misspoken on that, because I do feel that one of the ways to offer evidence to establish that indeed the discrimination that you're suffering rises to the level is to show that you have to go through a gauntlet to get to your desk, or when you get to your desk you're adversely affected."
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2765.181,2766.117,We all agree on what would be sufficient.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2767.283,2779.507,I think that it is... I don't believe that it is necessary to specifically assert and prove interference with your work performance in order to be successful.
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.507,2780.726,You don't.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2784.594,2790.065,I do not believe that it is absolutely necessary that in all circumstances you would have to prove that--
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2790.065,2790.648,Oh.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2790.648,2791.415,--Because I think--
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.415,2793.1,"Well, we don't have any disagreement here then."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2794.969,2799.937,"--No, I believe that that is an essential element, but under certain circumstances, for instance--"
1993.92-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2799.937,2820.1,"But you disagreed with this standard where the Sixth Circuit made it quite plain that it isn't under any circumstances, it's not... plaintiff need not prove, and that's why I asked you, because I wanted to be sure that you were associating yourself with the identical standard... it is the same statute, title VII."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2832.558,2842.783,"--The reason that I can't state that it is an absolute essential element is because that was never mentioned in the Meritor case, which is the only case that we have from this Court to give us guidance."
1993.92-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2860.161,2862.561,But then why should you win in this case?
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2862.561,2880.004,"Well, the issue that's been presented by this case and why I'm here is whether or not psychological damage, severe psychological damage has to be proven by the petitioner, and I... and I say to you I don't believe that the magistrate rested this case on that finding, and I concede--"
1993.92-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.004,2886.057,"The magistrate rested that case, and did no actual interference with work performance, and he did say that, but you say that's not necessary, either."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2886.057,2886.942,--I say--
1993.92-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2886.942,2889.461,"Why do you win, is what I'm trying to ask?"
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2889.461,2894.913,"--I think because the magistrate applied the language and test of the Meritor case, which is the only case we have."
1993.92-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.913,2895.715,He applied more than that.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2895.715,2896.465,I'm sorry.
1993.92-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2896.465,2897.048,He applied more than that.
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2903.368,2912.105,"Well, if he applied every test, including the Meritor test, which I say that he did, then how could he be clearly erroneous on the standards that he applied?"
1993.92-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.105,2913.557,Where did he apply the Meritor test?
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2913.557,2921.58,"At A-35 of the petition for writ of certiorari, he says,"
1993.92-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.573,2966.024,"One other question, if I may."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2974.63,2979.266,"The magistrate I believe said, to a reasonable woman manager in this position."
1993.92-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2983.903,2989.057,"Well, but the paragraph to which you refer is devoted to her subjective reaction."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,2989.057,2989.557,--Which--
1993.92-1168,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.557,2991.807,"A-34, running over to A-35."
1993.92-1168,2,41174,stanley_m_chernau,,3008.852,3011.804,"--The confines of that paragraph, I would agree with you, it does not."
1993.92-1168,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3090.506,3092.056,Very well.
