2005.04-607,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,12.797,"Mr. Franklin, whenever you're ready, you may proceed."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,12.797,36.217,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the court, the patent claim at issue in this case was held to be infringed whenever any doctor looks at a homocysteine test result and reflexively thinks about a basic natural correlation."
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,79.408,83.631,Is that second point... is that second point definiteness?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,83.631,86.189,"The second point is definiteness, it's enablement."
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,86.189,90.272,Does definiteness describe this second aspect that you've just--
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,90.272,91.756,"It describes part of it, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,91.756,92.417,--Just part of it.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,92.417,95.556,"There is definiteness, there is enablement, there is written description."
2005.04-607,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.633,98.726,Let's examine them.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,109.77,111.445,"I think not, Your Honor, because--"
2005.04-607,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.445,111.705,No?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,111.705,120.219,--definiteness would still require that you distinctly claim an invention here and that's one of the things that's absent in this case.
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,122.266,125.846,It's indefinite because we don't know where our thoughts will take us?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,135.307,140.02,"--Well, Your Honor, if it is definite, then it is certainly not enabling of an actual invention."
2005.04-607,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,163.532,166.34,But wasn't the issue there what is patentable?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,183.43,186.368,"But it was not just definiteness, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.291,284.033,Is the Abbott test... that's patented and you're paying royalties for that?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,284.033,285.917,"Actually, I don't know, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,340.492,353.189,The opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the appendix begins discussion of claim 13 about page 16a.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,360.492,363.771,In the Federal Circuit's--
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,363.771,364.315,Yes.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,379.46,380.944,"--Well, I think what--"
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,380.944,383.221,"You want me to tell the court of appeals, well, you can't do this."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,384.866,391.786,"--I think where it's wrong, Your Honor, is that it proceeds from an assumption that is wrong in itself and that is--"
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.786,397.313,So you can't point me to any particular sentence that would say that's absolutely wrong?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,397.313,406.348,"--I think that the argument in... the Federal Circuit's decision is wrong in its enablement discussion, it's wrong in its written description discussion."
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,427.15,427.273,And where does it say this?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,427.273,433.943,"I'm sorry, that is at page... I believe it's at 17 of the appendix."
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,442.567,443.599,You see my point?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,453.539,455.654,"--Well, I think it was raised, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,494.903,495.516,I guess that--
2005.04-607,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,495.516,506.618,"But you're arguing now, as I understand it, that the reason you win on definiteness is that it sweeps in even as yet uninvented processes."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,506.618,507.652,Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,507.652,519.145,"And it does so by means, in effect, of erecting this umbrella of a natural fact which is intended to cover every process that might be relevant to establishing that natural fact."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,519.145,519.368,Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,519.368,526.8,So that you're saying we cannot... no court can decide definiteness in this situation without hitting the patentable issue.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,526.8,527.573,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,532.736,558.916,"--But you told the... you said, judge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies Section 112 and is sufficiently precise and specific and concise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate Morse?"
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,558.916,559.909,--Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.909,561.914,And you argued that specifically?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,567.863,568.064,We did say that.
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.294,568.875,And it's the language.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,568.875,569.107,Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,569.107,569.698,That's what it said.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,571.092,571.996,"Diehr, which--"
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,571.996,573.099,Dier incorporates Morse.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,573.099,573.52,--Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,573.52,575.024,As I understand.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,575.024,575.234,Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,575.234,582.365,So your complaint about the paragraph on 17a is that it did not deal with that argument.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,582.365,582.958,Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,582.958,591.453,But I imagine they'll say that simply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to get us to think seriously about it.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,591.453,601.031,"Well, it was in the brief, Your Honor, and I think that it was also in, with the premise of everything that we argued, because the district court had already... and again, I point the Court to joint appendix page 60."
2005.04-607,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,654.442,660.61,"You said both the district court and the court of appeals but you don't think the district court got it right, either."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,662.687,663.117,Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,663.117,666.339,What was the something more and why wasn't that adequate?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,666.339,669.178,We don't know and that's why it wasn't adequate.
2005.04-607,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.407,703.932,"What the district court did is it got, it tried this case and it got a rather large jury verdict."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,703.932,704.102,--Yes.
2005.04-607,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,704.102,716.058,"And I don't understand how you're setting off the district court from the court of appeals when the court of appeals, whatever it said, it affirmed the judgment of the district court."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,716.058,720.19,"It did, but the claim construction is the part of what I'm talking about."
2005.04-607,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.853,761.977,I could see how that broad interpretation would raise perhaps for the... clearly raise for the first time the Section 101 issue.
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,776.55,784.431,"Well, we relied, Your Honor, on all of, many, many cases interpreting that provision and others under the law of nature--"
2005.04-607,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.431,786.008,"You never mentioned 101, though, did you?"
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,786.008,788.927,"--We didn't but just as an example, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,902.757,909.77,Is it true as the respondents argue that a holding in your favor would call into question thousands of patents?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,909.77,916.84,"Well, they don't mention all... the number but I don't think it would call into question a huge swath of patents."
2005.04-607,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,921.956,925.255,And do you have any idea how many there are of those?
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,925.255,925.746,No.
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,964.786,978.977,"If there is some likelihood or possibility of this that we should assess, it seems to me that it's imprudent for us to discuss it here when it hasn't been discussed in the court of appeals."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,978.977,981.254,"I think, well, it was, again, it was pressed in the court of appeals."
2005.04-607,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1017.484,1021.986,"You're urging on us something like plain error, is about what you're telling us."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1021.986,1031.304,"No, I think that we're urging the Court to examine the case that it has before it, look at the patent and we're not asking the Court to go further than this patent."
2005.04-607,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.42,1042.218,"When you say this patent, you really mean just claim 13, don't you?"
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1042.218,1043.592,"I'm... excuse me, Justice."
2005.04-607,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.524,1080.402,"Why shouldn't we do what the Solicitor General proposed, that is, since we don't know for sure, at least I don't know for sure, I'm not enough of a scientist, whether in fact the Section 112 determination, as made by the federal court, excludes all other possible use of this natural phenomenon."
2005.04-607,0,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,1101.014,1112.74,"--Quite simply, Your Honor, it's because the Court doesn't need to reach that issue and didn't need to reach it in any of its prior cases save one and that's the Benson case where that issue came up really in one sentence of the opinion."
2005.04-607,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.037,1240.561,"You may, Mr. Franklin."
2005.04-607,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1248.767,1249.007,"Oh, sorry."
2005.04-607,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1249.007,1256.851,"You're too hungry, Mr. Estrada."
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1258.305,1261.635,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court."
2005.04-607,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1286.39,1293.382,So you agree or you submit that you can have a definite description of something that's unpatentable because it's too broad?
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1293.382,1299.118,"Well, that obviously assumes the conclusion, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1346.249,1365.136,"But, but, but... well, let's assume that there is a claim that includes something that should not be patentable, because it's too broad or it involves the scientific phenomena, the mechanics of the universe."
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1373.16,1374.925,It can be.
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.93,1418.617,What do you think about its validity under 101?
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1418.617,1426.001,"Your Honor, as we suggested in our brief, we don't think that that question is properly before the Court but that--"
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1426.001,1426.181,Excuse me.
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1427.655,1428.016,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1459.239,1463.915,"The patent... talking about step 1, you can use any assay method you want."
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1473.703,1477.112,"--That's how the court of appeals construed it, yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.906,1481.756,"And is it possible that that can be patentable, in your view?"
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1481.756,1484.283,"--Well, again, Your Honor, we--"
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.283,1492.207,"If you just go to the doctor and ask for advice and he says, yes, I've looked at the results; you've got a vitamin B deficiency or whatever it is--"
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1492.207,1492.95,--As we indicated--
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1492.95,1495.589,--he's committed infringement under this patent as I understand it.
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1495.589,1508.036,"--As we indicated in our brief, we think that raises a potentially serious pre emption problem and it also raises the anticipation problem, that is, the section 102 argument which is not before the Court but if it were litigated--"
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.036,1510.584,It would raise the... just do you think that that patent is valid?
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1511.527,1517.875,"--Well, we think it has validity problems under section 102 and also under the pre emption,... potentially under the pre emption doctrine."
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.473,1541.196,I know all that.
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1544.706,1545.257,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.604,1553.611,Do you think there is a 101 problem too?
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1553.611,1556.149,"The preemption issue is a 101 problem, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.958,1579.869,So we do have a fairly long discussion by the lower court on the infringement issue.
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1582.928,1583.891,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.891,1584.384,Yeah.
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1584.384,1588.224,But the Court didn't grant certiorari on that question.
2005.04-607,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1588.767,1591.876,I didn't understand the definiteness doctrine.
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1653.982,1677.765,"Your Honor, I may have misspoken before but I think it's probably most accurate to read the Morse case as dealing with a written specification problem, that is, the specification in claim 8, the one Your Honor is referring to, didn't tell anything about the method by which the principle of nature, electromagnetism, would be used."
2005.04-607,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1693.58,1693.863,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1701.836,1717.936,"Well, the difference is between claiming a... claiming all methods of achieving a particular result and claiming one process for achieving that particular result and then as one claiming any means of doing one particular step."
2005.04-607,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.936,1724.826,I apply electricity to all methods of putting down letters with electricity.
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1730.323,1746.462,"Well, again, Your Honor, if it is true that all methods of employing the assay... excuse me, all methods of employing the correlation are preempted by this patent claim, then it would be invalid under section 101."
2005.04-607,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.097,1757.142,"Oh, no, I'm not talking about going beyond it."
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1780.511,1781.335,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-607,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1822.569,1826.039,"Okay, I think you've hit what is the problem for us."
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1834.153,1835.967,"Well, again, we don't know--"
2005.04-607,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1835.967,1846.85,"I thought an assay was in effect synonymous with any process that gets the relevant data and you're using it in a more... I think, in answering Justice Breyer's question, you were using it in a narrower sense."
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1846.85,1853.603,"--Well, I think that, as understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art, we... it may be."
2005.04-607,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1855.327,1861.837,"But I thought that was the point of your argument, that there are assays and then there are other methods."
2005.04-607,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1863.532,1865.547,"Well, no."
2005.04-607,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1880.914,1885.087,"Mr. Estrada, it's your turn now."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1885.087,1886.211,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-607,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2093.197,2097.17,Now what do you say in response to my question to the Solicitor General?
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2097.17,2098.914,"Which question, Justice Breyer?"
2005.04-607,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2099.878,2115.987,"That they thought it was obvious, that they thought that obviously the problem here with this particular claim is that it doesn't say specifically which tests this principle is meant to apply to."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2167.951,2170.329,I think it is wrong in the facts and under law.
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.054,2449.548,Let me just interrupt.
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2462.506,2465.396,--Our... yes and no.
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.316,2473.148,"Well, assume it's not Abbott."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2486.947,2487.461,--All right.
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.461,2494.392,"And I do that and then the doctor looks at it and says I think you've got a vitamin B deficiency, has he infringed your patent?"
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2494.392,2498.394,If the test was not ordered for the purpose of diagnosing--
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.394,2502.386,It was ordered for the purpose of letting the doctor know exactly what the assay would be.
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2502.826,2504.581,"--Well, unless--"
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.581,2504.914,He hasn't--
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2504.914,2508.312,"--there was a purpose for diagnosing the deficiency, I would say no."
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.575,2540.009,"--If a doctor asked me to perform under my, my own method, step 1, which I do it and I give him the results and then he tells the patient, I think you've got a vitamin B deficiency, in that case, he has infringed, if I understand your argument."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2540.009,2545.055,If he did it for the purposes of trying to determine whether you had a vitamin deficiency.
2005.04-607,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2574.271,2577.549,"You're onto something, to me, that is absolutely fundamental."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2592.244,2593.096,Correct.
2005.04-607,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.096,2593.709,And they're all useful.
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2635.925,2636.465,All right.
2005.04-607,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2637.649,2643.566,"Would it make sense to send this back and say, look, at least address their argument?"
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2645.854,2647.278,Three answers.
2005.04-607,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.434,2779.122,What was made by man here?
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2813.877,2821.698,"Well, the... we don't contend that the second step of the correlation is independently patentable even though the argument is framed as a... argument."
2005.04-607,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.886,2848.199,"It's a way found elsewhere if indeed the Federal Circuit had determined the second step, you know, step 1, do the assay, step 2, correlate."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2864.749,2866.716,"Well, that's unfair to the Federal Circuit on two points."
2005.04-607,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.799,2915.63,"No, please don't get off it... because this is my biggest problem with the case."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2932.17,2946.413,"--Well, it is true but is not necessarily the case that being aware of a natural phenomenon or of a correlation leads you inevitably to an inventive diagnostic test."
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.868,2968.88,"But you agree with me, do you not, that step 2 by itself would not be patentable?"
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2968.88,2970.124,"I do agree with that, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2970.124,2980.095,"Your point is that even though step 2 is performed as the second step of step 1 which is also not patentable, you get together for the patent?"
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2980.095,2980.486,That's true.
2005.04-607,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.199,3001.689,But does that fall within it?
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3044.817,3046.01,But Justice Breyer--
2005.04-607,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.01,3054.808,"And if you have a clear statement other than Diehr, Flook, Morse, which draws that line properly, let me know."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3054.808,3061.928,"--I think the telephone cases, Bell and Diehr, are cases that absolutely show that under this Court's cases, this is patentable subject matter."
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.727,3149.319,Would the case be different if they quoted Section 101 in their appendix?
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3149.319,3158.188,"Yes, I think it would be different, Justice Stevens, because then their argument that this was encompassed within one of the questions in the petition might have some surface plausibility."
2005.04-607,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3297.475,3299.773,You mean life isn't a fountain?
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3300.504,3303.372,--I didn't say it wasn't.
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3330.433,3334.936,"And Wainwright against Sykes was even decided before AEDPA was passed, too."
2005.04-607,3,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3334.936,3335.699,Exactly.
2005.04-607,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.78,3371.044,"Thank you, Mr. Estrada."
2005.04-607,4,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3376.47,3379.158,"Hopefully I won't, I won't have to use all that."
2005.04-607,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3437.773,3440.311,Weren't 112 and 101 combined at that time?
2005.04-607,4,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3440.311,3440.941,--They were.
2005.04-607,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3440.941,3441.474,Do you disagree with that?
2005.04-607,4,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3441.474,3442.035,"No, I don't."
2005.04-607,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.965,3462.849,"I don't want to take up your time on rebuttal but I have to ask you, do you have an explanation for not quoting section 101 in your papers?"
2005.04-607,4,30316,jonathan_s_franklin,,3462.849,3472.157,"I think the explanation is that we cited all of the cases... for example, Mackay Radio is a case we cited that doesn't itself cite 101."
2005.04-607,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3568.684,3570.211,Thank you.
