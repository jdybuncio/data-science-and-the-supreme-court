2011.10-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.752,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-680, Howes v. Fields."
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,6.67,9.539,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,46.228,51.016,Don't you think being in custody itself is a circumstance?
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,51.016,54.734,"--Sure, it's a circumstance that goes into the all-the-circumstances missed."
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,54.734,56.334,What's all this
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,71.094,73.029,"That's correct, we agree that that--"
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,73.029,80.199,So since when have we imported of the language of voluntariness into the Miranda test?
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,82.984,84.936,"--Justice Sotomayor, there are two separate tests."
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,87.205,90.923,So go to the test of freedom to leave.
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,90.923,91.573,Yes.
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,91.573,97.511,You're taken from your cell and locked into a room -- and let's change the facts--
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,97.511,98.227,Yes.
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,98.227,103.498,--and locked in a room and said: Talk to me; you have to tell me what happened.
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,105.25,115.973,"It would be much more difficult, but the test would be whether a reasonable person in the prisoner's position felt that they were free to go back to their cell in accord with reasonable ordinary prison procedures."
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,122.477,123.077,All right.
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,161.535,162.052,--Right.
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,189.771,194.673,"As I see the record, he claims twice he said: I don't want to talk to you."
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,205.714,209.416,"--There are two factors that go into the mix, and I will discuss each one in turn."
2011.10-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.37,249.826,Why is per se rule necessarily what is being argued here?
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,256.147,257.047,That's correct.
2011.10-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.047,264.919,So it's different from some cases where the prisoner initiates the conversation.
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,264.919,266.385,That is a little bit different.
2011.10-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,309.381,326.993,"And it doesn't make any difference that they took him from his cell, he was under compulsion to leave with them and interrogated during the hours when prisoners are ordinarily sleeping?"
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,326.993,335.349,"--Again, I would submit those are all circumstances that should go into this ""all the circumstances"" consideration."
2011.10-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,374.557,390.918,"General, when you say that, I took sometimes your brief and the U.S. Government's brief to be saying something more, which is that it's not all the circumstances; it's all the circumstances minus circumstances that are attendant upon normal prison living."
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,396.237,398.522,We are not taking quite that strong a position.
2011.10-680,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,415.551,427.359,"So a court can still think, when it's doing an all-the-circumstances inquiry, it can still factor in something like, you know, it just -- it was going to take him an hour to get back to his cell?"
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,431.761,434.029,"Not only can, but should, absolutely."
2011.10-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,497.619,500.155,Which way do you think that factor cuts?
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,500.155,502.423,In this particular situation?
2011.10-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,502.423,503.023,Yes.
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,503.023,513.898,"I think it cuts in our favor, as the trial court found, and the court should defer to that, for all the reasons I just stated: That he was not threatened; not physically harmed, he was in a conference room; door wasn't locked."
2011.10-680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.211,545.436,"Except when they say you have to leave, one way to interpret that or to analyze that might be to say: You are in custody no matter."
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,545.436,550.504,"--Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's the case because--"
2011.10-680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.504,557.409,"And when you say: You have to leave, that's almost coercive, coercive of him to say, because he doesn't want to have to go back in the cell."
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,557.409,565.847,--I don't think that's the case because under Shatzer there's nothing Miranda custodial about simply being in his cell.
2011.10-680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,575.205,578.59,"But I think it makes your case weaker, not stronger, that statement."
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,578.59,587.696,"--I think it makes it stronger, because in the typical Miranda case you would say to someone: If you don't cooperate, we are going to keep you here as long as it takes."
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,673.902,691.68,"The Chief asked you in his question which way does it cut, meaning you seem to be advocating a rule that says merely because he's in prison is irrelevant, standing alone."
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,718.581,725.4,"Justice Sotomayor, I'm going to start with the premise we are not advocating that the prison conditions fall out of the equation entirely."
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,743.546,751.385,"What -- what would make someone who is forced to go somewhere think that they are free to go back, absent being told?"
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,761.84,763.023,"Well, there are--"
2011.10-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,763.023,765.308,Once they are forced to go from point A to point B.
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,765.308,765.842,--Right.
2011.10-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,828.983,830.068,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-680,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,830.068,830.751,Thank you.
2011.10-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,830.751,840.457,Ms. Anders.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,840.457,845.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,918.976,927.414,"Suppose the policeman said: I'm taking you away with me for 20 minutes, period."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,935.802,938.537,You have to look to the totality of the circumstances in that--
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.537,939.539,Those are the totality.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,939.539,940.539,--in that case.
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,940.539,941.589,I just gave you the totality.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,941.589,951.097,"In that situation they may not be in custody, because Shatzer established that simply being in prison and subject to normal prison--"
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.097,951.897,"No, no, no."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,958.268,960.22,--You would look to--
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.22,961.553,There is no other circumstance.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,965.222,967.172,"--I think he may not be in custody, because--"
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,967.172,967.822,Not in custody.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,967.822,968.59,--because again you have to--
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.59,969.84,He's only going to be there for 20 minutes.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,969.84,972.409,--You look to what the reasonable inmate in that situation would feel--
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.409,974.328,He would have thought he could leave after 20 minutes.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,974.328,985.734,"--You would look to what the reasonable inmate would feel, and in that situation you would look to his experience with the prison, you would look to the circumstances of the questioning, whether they are accusatorial, whether they are pleasant."
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,985.734,986.051,Okay.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,986.051,987.067,The location of the room.
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,987.067,987.334,"Now, outside."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1000.811,1003.061,You may have to in that situation.
2011.10-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.061,1003.627,What's the difference?
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1003.627,1011.866,"The difference is that the person who is on the street, their baseline is that they have complete free will, they have freedom of movement."
2011.10-680,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1053.776,1056.145,"Could I ask you a different sort of question, Ms. Anders."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1084.396,1088.449,I think the State court opinions are somewhat unclear.
2011.10-680,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1223.555,1234.261,"Well, going back to confusing coercion issues with custody issues, and -- I don't know that you have really answered Justice Breyer's question."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1246.419,1250.122,"--I think in either situation, you have to look to the totality of the circumstances."
2011.10-680,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1280.058,1281.475,"Well, but he didn't choose to go in that room."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1290.798,1291.782,"--Well, I think two points."
2011.10-680,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1324.521,1337.094,"If he were and the police officer said, come along with us, okay, he could say, no."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1341.213,1342.648,--That's right.
2011.10-680,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1374.103,1378.338,Is the -- is the time relevant that this was done?
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1382.39,1393.248,"--I think that would be a relevant factor here, too, as would the fact that the door was partially open, the questioning was not threatening, there were only two officers--"
2011.10-680,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.248,1398.301,"That didn't do him any good, because he couldn't get back to his cell without being escorted there."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1398.301,1399.801,--That's correct.
2011.10-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1418.796,1424.767,"Counsel, I wonder why you just agreed that the 7 hours would be a pertinent circumstance."
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1435.641,1437.241,"--I think that's exactly right, that--"
2011.10-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1437.241,1440.209,So it is not a relevant circumstance on the custody question.
2011.10-680,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1440.209,1452.6,"--It is a circumstance within the totality of the circumstances here, but any kind of effect that it had on making the inmate feel that he couldn't terminate the question was entirely offset by the fact that he was told that he could leave multiple times."
2011.10-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1452.6,1454.219,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1456.404,1461.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.223,1514.775,"Well, it certainly -- it certainly doesn't mean he can leave the prison, right?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1514.775,1515.86,--Right.
2011.10-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.86,1518.728,"That's clear, but -- but isn't that the only difference?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1523.446,1524.548,Prisoners--
2011.10-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.548,1529.852,But what could it possibly mean if it didn't mean you could leave this room where you are now being questioned?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1529.852,1544.377,"--Let me answer that question by pointing out that in -- I believe it's Georgison and Cervantes where there is a button, and the prisoner has the ability to go and press the button and call his own jailers."
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1569.494,1571.263,What is the rule that you want us to adopt?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1571.263,1576.498,The rule I want you to adopt is the rule in Mathis.
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1581.735,1583.851,So everybody in prison is in custody at all times.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1583.851,1584.201,--Right.
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1585.27,1589.255,"So if you want to question anybody in prison about anything, you have to give them Miranda warnings."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1589.255,1589.772,--No.
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1600.813,1601.913,What sense does that make?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1610.768,1632.001,"And in certain circumstances, I agree with you, that in fact, this Court should hold that when the correction officers are investigating a crime within the prison, then -- and they remove the prisoner and they isolate him, take him out of the general population, that this Court should then hold Miranda is applicable."
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1633.851,1641.19,"So whenever -- so whenever a prisoner is isolated and questioned about a crime, no matter where it occurs, the Miranda warning has to be given?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1641.19,1641.69,--Yes.
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1641.69,1644.908,About a possible crime?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1644.908,1649.043,Yes.
2011.10-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1653.864,1662.287,"Well, how is that consistent with the totality of circumstances test that we've always insisted upon in Miranda cases?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1662.287,1671.893,"Well, Miranda -- not all the -- there are bright-line rules attached to Miranda, so that Miranda itself is a bright-line rule."
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1710.184,1722.592,"If the prisoner is stabbed in the yard, and there are 50 prisoners in the yard at the time and the prison guards want to question everybody to see what they saw, they all have to be given Miranda warnings?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1722.592,1729.931,"--Well, that's an interesting fact situation, because some of those people are just witnesses and they are not necessarily suspects."
2011.10-680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1736.485,1736.818,"No, no."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1752.178,1765.602,"--I -- I'm sorry, but I had thought that what Miranda also said is if it's a witness, and you know -- you believe that it's a witness, and that you are not asking questions that are going to incriminate them, that then you don't have to give Miranda."
2011.10-680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1767.202,1767.652,Well--
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1767.652,1770.92,"Once the point it becomes incriminating, then you give them Miranda rights."
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1770.92,1774.222,"If it's a witness in the outside world, the witness is unlikely to be in custody."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1774.222,1778.426,"I understand, but I thought your hypothetical had to do with being stabbed in the yard."
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1778.426,1778.993,It does.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1778.993,1780.362,Okay.
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1780.362,1786.515,"So these -- all these people in your view are in custody, and they all are being asked questions that may incriminate them--"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1786.515,1787.415,If they--
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1787.415,1791.067,--and they don't have to be given Miranda warnings unless they are suspects.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1791.067,1806.443,"--If they are removed from the general population, if they are taken by a corrections officer to a cell where they are going to be interrogated; they are isolated; it is incommunicado; they are being interrogated by officers; they know they are officers -- they have some Miranda choices--"
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1806.443,1807.279,When will that not occur?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1818.737,1826.924,--I think -- I think at that point they are going to put the people that were in the yard back in their cells.
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1828.508,1830.627,And then they will be isolated.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1830.627,1831.244,Yes.
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1831.244,1833.01,So they all will get Miranda warnings.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1833.01,1833.579,So they will get Miranda.
2011.10-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1853.074,1855.676,And where do you get this focus on isolation from?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1861.164,1863.599,"It's -- well, I've got two answers for that."
2011.10-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1898.522,1902.907,"I thought that there was no discussion of the ""in custody"" point in Mathis."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1915.064,1921.652,--I read Mathis as to say that he was in custody for the -- for the question of the crime.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1932.843,1935.476,"Well, Justice Ginsburg is quite right."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1964.478,1975.786,"In Mathis, because he was -- I guess it was the lower court thought that because he was not in custody on the crime of which they were going to ask questions--"
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1975.786,1976.336,Right.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1976.336,1979.155,--that therefore you didn't have to give him Miranda.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1979.155,1979.838,Right.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1979.838,1991.813,But I think what the Supreme Court was implying is that it doesn't matter what -- what you are in -- in prison for; you are in custody at that point that you are in the cell with these officers.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1991.813,1993.532,"Do you know, where exactly in Mathis?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,1993.532,1995.183,I'm saying--
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1995.183,1996.216,It's only about five pages long.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2002.687,2005.289,--What I'm saying is that it is implied by Mathis.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2005.289,2006.005,Exactly.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2006.005,2006.891,You can infer it from Mathis.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2006.891,2007.324,Exactly.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2009.04,2009.173,But that--
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.173,2010.757,--Is that clearly established law?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2010.757,2011.959,--Yes.
2011.10-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2032.971,2033.554,"Well, do you agree--"
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2033.554,2039.208,Do you agree that this is not -- what you want to derive from Mathis is not part of the holding of Mathis?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2039.208,2044.094,--I think it's a rational -- I think it's a rational extension.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2044.094,2045.278,It's an extension.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2045.278,2048.898,But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's new law.
2011.10-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2048.898,2062.056,"I thought you were going back to Miranda itself, which says in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2062.056,2063.106,Yes.
2011.10-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2063.106,2082.987,So -- and I think you've repeated the phrase from -- from Miranda that what the -- what it was aiming at was incommunicado interrogation of an individual in a police-dominated atmosphere.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2093.694,2095.377,Which court?
2011.10-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2096.546,2109.287,"This Court, this Court, because this Court now seems to assume that it must be in custody and not -- not otherwise deprived of action, that being in custody is essential."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2109.287,2128.098,"I -- I read that as still being the law, that there are the two clauses; one is you are under arrest, and the other is your freedom of movement is restricted such that a reasonable person would think that you were not -- that you were not free to leave."
2011.10-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2131.636,2136.454,"Yes, I think you did."
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2136.454,2139.14,I'm not sure you answered mine from before.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2139.14,2139.706,I'm sorry.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2139.706,2149.181,How do you think that your argument or the decision of the court below was implicit in or an extension of Mathis?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2160.737,2177.598,"I think that when -- when the Sixth Circuit is analyzing the State court decision, they are looking at the State court decision, and that decision says if there's no nexus between what you are being questioned about and what you are in custody for, then you don't have to get Miranda."
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2182.669,2195.577,"Well, I thought what we have been arguing about is not the nexus issue, but instead whether in light of the circumstances or under an absolute rule there is custody."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2195.577,2198.112,I think we are arguing about two things.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2217.842,2223.396,And what is the clearly established law set forth in our cases that answers that latter question?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2223.396,2225.546,Whether -- if there is a per se rule?
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2250.996,2251.946,Can I can you this?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2282.101,2289.188,"I think they do, because I think that telling him that he is free to go is not a substitute for Miranda."
2011.10-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2321.076,2328.746,"Well, their question -- the question is, is the person entitled to Miranda warnings?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2352.529,2354.064,That's correct.
2011.10-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2374.525,2380.446,But they said: We would like to talk to you about it; but you don't have to talk to us; you are free to go.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2392.07,2398.41,--I think -- I think you are now describing him as being much nicer than I had assumed he was the first time around.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2457.378,2463.882,"Can I -- Since we are talking about the Sixth Circuit decision, what it says is, this is on page 10 A,"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2484.213,2484.879,Yes.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2484.879,2493.502,I thought Mathis rejected the argument that it depends on whether the crime is the one you are in prison for or something else.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2493.502,2494.402,I'm sorry.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2506.926,2517.7,"Well, the first part, Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population, okay?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2531.208,2535.329,"--I thought that it was between 10 A, page 10 A and page 14 A."
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2535.329,2536.312,"No, no, where in Mathis?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2536.312,2546.035,"This was the question that we talked about before, and what I'm saying is that I believe that they are implying that and were inferring that."
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2558.009,2565.18,If the argument were that Miranda was not required because this concerns a different crime than what you are in prison for here.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2580.889,2592.014,--I again say that this is what one infers from Mathis.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2592.014,2592.83,Okay.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2592.83,2593.782,That's the general principle.
2011.10-680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2593.782,2598.334,--And what you infer is the rule that incarceration constitutes custody.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2598.334,2601.386,No.
2011.10-680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2623.149,2627.801,"That is Shatzer, and Shatzer was careful to say we've never decided that issue."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2627.801,2645.162,"--I think what Shatzer was saying, and I know it's hard for me to tell you what Shatzer is saying since you decided Shatzer, but I think that Shatzer seems to be aimed at correction officials, that whether correction officials -- I think Shatzer is saying we never decided the whole issue."
2011.10-680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2646.598,2647.998,"Well, it states in broader terms."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2656.037,2657.537,--But I think--
2011.10-680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.537,2660.089,"It talks about Bradley, which was definitely litigation."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2660.089,2671.214,"--I think that Shatzer was referring to the whole umbrella of -- of people that would come into the prison, including people that would be in the prison and want to talk to -- to prisoners."
2011.10-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2694.993,2707.903,"--Ms. Jacobs, wouldn't it be fair to say -- it seems to be me that Shatzer must -- excuse me, Mathis must have found that Mr. Mathis -- the Court in Mathis must have found that Mr. Mathis was in custody."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2710.019,2710.436,Yes.
2011.10-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2710.436,2715.407,But we have no idea why the Court thought that Mr. Mathis was in custody.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2734.068,2740.54,I think that Mathis does mention factors that went into the decision about whether he was in custody.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2764.739,2777.047,"Isn't the best you can say, not that Mathis found but perhaps that Mathis apparently assumed that he was in custody, because there is no discussion of it?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2779.915,2780.349,I agree.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.349,2783.634,"--Yes, they give a factual recital, he was in his cell and all that."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2783.634,2791.307,"I just don't think -- I don't doubt that they thought that Mathis was in custody, which is why they were talking about Miranda to begin with."
2011.10-680,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2792.84,2795.775,But we don't know why they thought Mathis was in custody.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2798.527,2806.316,And it's not dicta; as far as I can tell it becomes part of clearly established law.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.249,2807.832,What is dicta?
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2810.884,2811.484,--Right.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2811.484,2813.034,You don't have anything that is said about it here.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2813.034,2828.01,"But I -- my argument, Justice Roberts, is that saying that he is in a cell and that he is being questioned, by officers, that that is -- and he's being questioned about a crime, that that is custody; and from that there is a principle."
2011.10-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2904.077,2911.85,There is no indication that he told them -- that he told the--
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2911.85,2913.716,"No, I agree there isn't."
2011.10-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2913.716,2914.967,--officers that he needed medication.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2914.967,2916.484,"No, I agree that there isn't."
2011.10-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2934.463,2948.273,"The first Ohio court -- I'm sorry, the court below -- had its own -- seemingly had its own absolute rule, yet -- that if you are told you're free to go, that that breaks the chain of custody, whatever that might mean."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,2965.65,2980.677,--I don't believe that telling a prisoner that he's free -- that he's free to leave -- is a substitute for Miranda.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2994.268,3001.172,"Counsel, you mentioned several times, when we were talking about Mathis, that, you know, they mentioned he was in -- in a cell, right?"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3005.307,3008.359,"--No, I don't, but I really -- really did brief the case."
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3012.577,3013.111,"I did, too."
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3017.631,3018.548,--Great.
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.548,3021.617,"--All I see is noting that he was in prison serving a State sentence, but--"
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3021.617,3025.585,"But it definitely -- it should be talking about the officers, the agents in the cell with him."
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3025.585,3026.237,--Okay.
2011.10-680,2,22557,elizabeth_l_jacobs,,3026.237,3052.052,"Just as a -- as a final comment, I just want to say that Harrington v. Richter requires a finding before a writ can issue of an extreme malfunction in the justice system, that certainly where a State court has decided a constitutional issue -- under Supreme Court law and ignores Supreme Court law, that we really do have an extreme malfunction of the Supreme Court decision."
2011.10-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3061.827,3062.794,Thank you.
2011.10-680,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3065.279,3075.917,I think the hypotheticals today demonstrate how quickly the logic of the Sixth Circuit's new per se rule falls apart when you test it with other facts.
2011.10-680,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.009,3222.695,"Thank you, counsel."
