1987.86-870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.618,"We will hear argument this morning in No. 86-870, Phillips Petroleum Company v. Mississippi and Saga Petroleum."
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,13.841,15.241,"Than you, Your Honor."
1987.86-870,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.729,290.303,"Mr. Gressman, excuse me."
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,334.191,340.215,"No, Your Honor, I do not think that is a fair reading of the Decisions of this Court."
1987.86-870,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.796,361.419,"We have not addressed it either way: we have not said ""yes"", and we have not said ""no""."
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,361.419,433.174,"--That is true, but I think that if you look at the purposes of the ""public trust"" doctrine, this Court has consistently said that the purpose of the doctrine, the purpose of the ""equal footing"" doctrine, is premised on the public need to use the waters as navigable highways of commerce, and that is the critical fact that justifies reading the Decisions of this Court as meaning that, if you have a non-navigable body of water that happens to be subject to tidal influence, that kind of underwater land can never become part of the public trust domain for the very reason that there is no purpose served; there is no commercial navigability that is possible."
1987.86-870,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.666,441.482,"What do you do about the last ten feet of the ocean, near the shore, which last ten feet are not navigable?"
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,444.303,445.563,"--Certainly not, Your Honor."
1987.86-870,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.563,446.274,--And why is that?
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,446.274,464.266,"Every navigable body of water, be it the ocean, the Mississippi River, or any other large body of water, has at its shore, or at its edges, a non-navigable shoreline."
1987.86-870,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.266,466.887,"Right, now, how do you know where the ocean ends?"
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,472.34,474.571,Because--
1987.86-870,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.571,483.419,"Once you have accepted the principle that ""navigability"" is not the test... as you just have... you have to decide where the ocean ends: why does it not end where the ebb and flow start?"
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,483.419,486.96,--There are various explanations of that.
1987.86-870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.981,640.43,"Mr. Gressman, certainly Chief Justice Taney's Opinion in Genesee Chief, as Justice Scalia says, extends Admiralty jurisdiction to navigable waters that were non-tidal, there is nothing indicating that all tidal waters were not also included."
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,640.43,641.992,--As long as they were navigable.
1987.86-870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.992,653.94,"Well, but I do not... when you say that Admiralty jurisdiction extends to ""tidal waters"", and then you go on and say"
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,663.527,666.311,"Not necessarily, as long as they are navigable."
1987.86-870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,712.14,715.173,"The collision of the Genesee Chief took place on Lake Ontario, I thought?"
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,715.173,729.831,"Well, but I think that an example, perhaps, is better shown... I think he talked about examples of various rivers in this country, like the Mississippi, but I think that affords an example of what he was talking about."
1987.86-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.773,1044.415,"Of course, Mr. Gressman, under their theory it really does not matter, does it?"
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1044.415,1058.506,"Well, it does not matter except to say that it is totally incorrect as a statement of the basis on which you impose public trust dominion."
1987.86-870,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1107.228,1131.113,"Mr. Gressman, the Submerged Lands Act, of course, has language that your opponent suggests affects the resolution of the problem: it says that all lands permanently or periodically covered by tidal waters are included as lands beneath navigable waters."
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1134.225,1136.226,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.777,1306.518,"Oh, no."
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1307.979,1342.452,"Well, the inference is that if, from the fact that, if public title, public trust title, is the equivalent of navigability purposes, shall we say... that necessarily excludes from the public trust concept those waters that are not suitable for commercial navigation."
1987.86-870,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.502,1378.033,But that was not the reason.
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1396.617,1419.28,"No, Your Honor, the English common law, going back as far as 1604, in the River Banne case... and that has never been questioned in subsequent cases as far as I know... stated that there is a clear distinction between a navigable water and a non-navigable stream."
1987.86-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.844,1439.075,Even if the tide reaches them?
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1439.075,1443.687,I would say
1987.86-870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.95,1460.679,"But if you read Chief Justice Taney's Opinion in Genesee Chief, you get the impression that at least that Court thought that navigability and tidal characters were coterminous in England."
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1460.679,1476.719,"Well, they were because of the peculiar geography of England... such a small country that all this was set forth, explained not only in Genesee Chief, but down through the years and Illinois Central repeats this history again--"
1987.86-870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.719,1486.176,"But then you never would get a situation in England where the river was navigable but non-tidal, or tidal but non-navigable."
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1486.176,1492.781,"--Possibly not, but that was... that situation did not exist in this country."
1987.86-870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.668,1524.874,"Yes, but what I am uncertain about is how good an authority your River Banne case in England is in 1604?"
1987.86-870,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,1530.988,1544.045,"Well, even in England, I suppose there are little streams... discrete little steams... tributaries, that are not navigable."
1987.86-870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.115,1621.367,"Thank you, Mr. Gressman."
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1624.392,1629.955,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1739.095,1755.356,"Well, Ms. Sones, I guess the... Petitioners here had been paying taxes on these lands all these years on the assumption they owned them?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1755.356,1766.071,"Your Honor, the lower court ruled on the issue that the payment of taxes was not at issue in this case simply because--"
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1766.071,1769.444,"That may be, but is it not correct?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1781.212,1792.66,"--Justice O'Connor, it is true that the Petitioners allege that they had paid taxes on the lands in question, but the State's--"
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1792.66,1797.854,"Well, and they held some titles that purported to cover the lands in question?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1797.854,1804.977,"--The title which they had were quitclaim deeds... in the nature of quitclaim deeds, by Acts of Congress."
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1804.977,1810.761,And they had paid taxes on it and that was the common assumption until the State issued the mineral leases?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1813.282,1815.686,That was their assumption.
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1815.686,1817.116,"Well, is that right?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1820.758,1822.949,"It is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.949,1823.72,"Yes, thank you."
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1823.72,1829.394,One fundamental principle of law that we are concerned with here--
1987.86-870,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1829.394,1833.137,"It is a long time... it is over 150 years that they have been paying taxes, is it not?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1833.137,1845.983,"--Your Honor, we would assert that the payment of taxes on these lands really did not affect what ownership that the State had in these properties."
1987.86-870,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1845.983,1852.338,"Yes, but the State of Mississippi or its subordinate municipalities gladly accepted the payment of taxes?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1852.338,1864.196,"The municipality, even though it may have accepted payment of taxes on these properties, the lower court ruled that this issue did not resolve the question as to the title."
1987.86-870,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1864.196,1867.138,"I know what the lower court ruled, but the fact is there."
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1878.956,1882.779,"On these 42 acres, they would not be."
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.779,1899.569,"Well, do you not suppose that if we were to Affirm, there would be additional lands that are now in private hands, or use, that Mississippi would in the future claim as part of its public trust?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1918.563,1925.416,"Your Honor, this is not a new issue in the State of Mississippi."
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1927.889,1929.358,But is that correct?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1929.358,1932.591,"--Your Honor, there would be other lands that are affected by this."
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.591,1933.061,Yes?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,1935.112,1944.569,The State of Mississippi currently has at least around 600 acres that are tidally-influenced.
1987.86-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.281,2001.887,"Ms. Sones, with respect to the 42 acres that are in dispute here, would taxes paid on that as a separate parcel, so that a separate tax payment was made for lands entirely subject to tidal influence, or was it just a part of a larger parcel?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2001.887,2005.939,These lands were not issued separately.
1987.86-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.119,2024.631,And now 42 acres of that 640 are being disputed by the State?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2024.631,2026.762,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-870,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.762,2036.23,"And the State did accept the money as a tax payment, did not understand that it was tendered to purchase the property, did it not?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2036.23,2042.143,"No, Your Honor, these were donation claims where the Petitioners actually got their property."
1987.86-870,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.392,2311.279,"Let us not exaggerate it too much: there is a certain amount of... a degree of uncertainty, in the ""tidelands"" rule as well."
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2326.891,2333.042,"It is not an easy thing to calculate, Justice Scalia, but it can be done."
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.177,2387.318,May I ask you a question... excuse me?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2393.422,2407.06,"These are tributaries on the east bank of the Jordan River... I am sorry, the west bank of the Jordan River, and this land is bounded on the south by Bayou LaCroix, which is a navigable, in-fact, waterway."
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.06,2410.963,"Now, is the Jordan River a fresh-water river or a salt-water river?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2410.963,2412.706,The Jordan River is salt-water river.
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.706,2414.856,And are the tributaries also salt-water?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2414.856,2417.518,These tributaries are also salt-water.
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.619,2437.912,"To the extent they contribute anything to the Jordan River, are they not fresh?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2437.912,2445.045,They are salt-water as... at times they would be fresh-water.
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.045,2449.278,"To the extent they contribute water to the Jordan River, are they not entirely fresh?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2449.278,2457.734,"To the extent they contribute to it, the Jordan River backs up into these tributaries."
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.734,2461.877,So that it is the effect of the backup that raises the level.
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2473.955,2485.483,"It is possible that they could be mostly fresh water, if you go for a long period of time without any rain, then the salinity content of any of these areas would be very high."
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.213,2491.406,"Well, I suppose in that case, they probably would not get much influence from the tide, either, would they?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2491.406,2497.44,"--Well, the tide would not change, since it is coming in from the Gulf of Mexico."
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.714,2526.209,"What is the purpose... and your opponent argues that the purpose of the ""public trust"" doctrine should be kept in mine, and it focuses on discrete bodies of water that can be named either as ""bays"", and so-forth... what is the purpose of the ""public trust"" doctrine as to what we are talking about in this case?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2526.209,2535.855,"The ""public trust"" doctrine is used in Mississippi and the Record indicated what interest the public actually has in this land."
1987.86-870,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2642.846,2696.578,"Ms. Sones, if the decision below was correct, that the public trust land extends even to discrete, separate, small tributary streams, conveying fresh water into a tidally-influenced area, apparently, according to the brief of the American Land Title Association as amicus, if that is correct, there are literally millions of landowners throughout the United States who would be divested of their property contrary to the understanding and expectation of those owners and the title insurance company that have insured their title through the years."
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2710.841,2726.659,"It is a factor, but not one that we feel is something that would actually change land titles."
1987.86-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.459,2761.281,How deep are these bayous?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2765.055,2766.825,These bayous... some of them.
1987.86-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2768.858,2769.409,That is pretty deep.
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2769.409,2781.666,"--are I would say anywhere from two feet to four feet on up to 15 feet... the Jordan River itself is about 30 feet deep, and it is commercially navigable."
1987.86-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2781.666,2784.947,But some small bayous are also deep?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2784.947,2789.691,"And some of these are also deep, particularly when the tide comes in."
1987.86-870,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.05,2965.234,"And anyway for some tributaries further up the Mississippi, are you not... or is the Mississippi tidal... throughout the State?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2965.234,2972.751,"The Mississippi River, as Mr. Gressman indicated, is tidally-influenced up about 30 miles."
1987.86-870,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.751,2975.743,So above that you are going to confront this same problem anyway.
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,2993.094,3001.168,"It is our contention that where you have a ""navigable-in-fact"" waterway, you will always have some areas that you cannot navigate over."
1987.86-870,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.573,3008.915,"I understand that, but are you going to answer my question?"
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,3008.915,3013.047,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1987.86-870,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.047,3024.994,"My question is, the confusing difficulty you were just referring to, cannot be totally eliminated even if we come out the way you want us to on this case."
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,3040.054,3048.439,"That is still going to be a problem, but that is a different type of law employed for fresh water as opposed to tidally-influenced waters."
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.522,3083.762,May I ask one other question before you sit down?
1987.86-870,1,33871,kathy_d_jones,,3103.464,3145.652,"There was a witness who testified in the lower court that he had cattle that he saw at times would graze down to some of these areas in question, and also the Jordan River, which is primarily a salt water river, but you would find this on any waterway that also flows from the Gulf of Mexico or any other salt water body where at certain times of the year, if you had a lot of rain, the cattle could come down there and graze, but at other times the salinity content would be so high that it would be impossible for them to drink out of that water."
1987.86-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3158.091,3162.044,Thank you.
1987.86-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3162.044,3162.445,"Thank you, Ms. Sones."
1987.86-870,2,22360,eugene_gressman,,3164.546,3165.765,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.86-870,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3360.936,3362.786,"Your time has expired, Mr. Gressman."
1987.86-870,2,22360,eugene_gressman,,3362.786,3364.188,"--Yes, they would be--"
1987.86-870,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3364.188,3365.538,The case is submitted.
1987.86-870,2,22360,eugene_gressman,,3365.538,3367.791,"--The case is submitted, right, Your Honor."
