1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.016,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-5661, Juan Melendez v. The United States."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,9.087,10.909,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.091,82.106,"It's agreed, is it not, Mr. Mullin, that the Government's motion was not filed under section 3553(e)?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,82.106,87.268,"That... no, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't agree with that."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.907,109.782,"Well, the question presented, and I believe it was presented in your petition, is... let me get the petition."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,135.48,143.084,"--Oh, no, no, I'm not saying that they brought... that they specific... they specify their application as being under section 3553(e), Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.337,154.603,"Well then the Government... at least the Government's motion by its terms was not made pursuant to 3553(e), you agree with--"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,154.603,155.683,"--Oh, that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, yes."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.623,234.456,"--Whereabouts is that found, Mr. Mullin?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,234.456,238.338,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, in my brief, my first brief to the Court."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.921,246.692,"Thank you, and would you tell us again what you're quoting from the statute?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,246.692,258.6,"Moving down to the first line, Congress directed... let me state the language."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,296.647,303.42,"Well, that's quite consistent with 3553(e), isn't it, that the Commission was to have a role in both of those kinds of departures?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,303.42,304.661,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-5661,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.735,329.817,"Well, counsel, do you agree that the Commission certainly could have set up an implementation of the statutes that would have set up this kind of two-tier approach that the Government urges?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,329.817,331.569,"--Justice O'Connor, I agree with you."
1995.95-5661,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.569,338.181,But you simply say to us that that isn't how the Commission implemented it.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,338.181,338.782,That is correct.
1995.95-5661,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.782,341.084,And set up instead a one-tier--
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,341.084,342.415,"That is correct, yes."
1995.95-5661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,377.108,388.216,"--Mr. Mullin, what is the clearest indication that that is indeed what the Commission meant, because I found that there was at least some ambiguity."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,388.216,397.06,"The clearest indication I would state, Justice Ginsburg, is found in Note 7 to section 2D1.1."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.646,406.217,You certainly should have.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,406.217,415.242,"And I apologize to the Court for failing to do that, but section 2D1.1 deals with drug cases."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.046,426.99,"Are we now... 2D1, are we talking about something that you did manage to put in your appendix, or is that the one that you left out?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,426.99,433.004,"--Chief Justice, I didn't put it in my appendix."
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.757,451.647,"In the reply brief, or brief?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,451.647,452.889,Of my original brief.
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.613,544.158,Does 994(n) not refer to 3553?
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,544.158,549.21,"I don't believe it does, judge."
1995.95-5661,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.682,576.32,"Well, section 994(n) doesn't refer by number to 3553(e), I take it, but it does say the commission shall ensure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence, including a sentence that's lower than established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take account of a defendant's substantial assistance."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,576.32,576.709,Yes.
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.709,591.088,"And 3553(e) is titled, Limited Authority to Impose a Sentence Below a Statutory Minimum, suggesting that that may be the only source of authority to impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum to me."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,591.088,592.49,"Well, it was... yes."
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.041,615.636,I'm not sure what your point about the guidelines is.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,620.467,620.948,Correct.
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.948,628.612,"Now, are you saying that the guidelines could dispense with the necessity for a Government motion despite the fact that the statute says you need it?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,628.612,629.563,Absolutely not.
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.563,631.474,Then what do the guidelines achieve?
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,638.71,640.009,"No, they cannot, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.009,643.803,"Well then, what is it that you claim the guidelines do?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,643.803,677.195,"What the guidelines do is require that the Government bring a motion based upon a defendant's substantial assistance, and that is what section 3553(e) requires, before there can be departure below a mandatory minimum, and it's the petitioner's position that under section 5K1.1 the Commission devised a scheme where only one motion has to be brought for a departure both from the applicable guideline range as well as below statutory minimums, so there is the motion requirement met under section 3553."
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.195,690.083,"You are saying that the guidelines have the power to say that a motion to move downward in the guidelines, to depart from the guidelines is, ipso facto, a motion under 3553."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,691.234,692.844,That's correct.
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,693.545,695.378,"Well, that isn't correct as a statement of law, is it?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,706.043,707.573,"--That's correct, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.573,713.509,"All right, and if that's true, they could say, I'll tell you one situation in which you can depart downward from a guideline."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,740.825,741.606,That's correct.
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.606,741.947,All right.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,776.059,780.662,"Well, the Government here brought a motion under section 5K1.1."
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,781.432,782.373,But they didn't do it right.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,789.568,794.321,"--Well, section 5K1.1, as I--"
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,794.321,802.045,"5K1.1 says if you want to move under 5K1.1, bring a mandatory statutory type motion, and they're telling you they didn't do it."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,802.045,806.149,"--As I read section 5K1.1, it doesn't require that, though, Justice--"
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.149,806.84,"Oh, yes it does."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,819.258,820.748,"--Well, if there's no... if there's--"
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,820.748,823.069,If they never brought a 5K1.1.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,823.069,824.541,--If they never brought the 5K1.1--
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,824.541,824.951,Yes.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,824.951,825.65,--then the court has no authority to depart.
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,825.65,826.191,That's right.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,826.191,826.591,Yes.
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.591,828.193,And so now what happens to your client?
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,828.193,833.116,"At that point he has, at best, under this scenario, a 135-month sentence."
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.116,833.627,Why?
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,833.627,834.619,Because that's the bottom of the--
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,834.619,836.879,Didn't they make a promise that they would bring such a motion?
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,836.879,840.891,--They had... they said they would bring a motion if there was substantial assistance.
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,840.891,843.472,"Yes, and didn't they break that promise if they didn't do it?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,843.472,846.945,"Well, that gets into the Wade case, and what this Court decided in Wade."
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.945,852.989,"To just... all right, I'll take it up with them, but I... what I... I'm not certain about this case."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,868.069,896.688,"Well, they're... to the extent that the Government agreed in the plea agreement here to bring a motion for departure under section 5K1.1, and didn't state, as they didn't in this plea agreement, that they would seek a cap on the reduction, I agree with Your Honor that they certainly are either in violation of the agreement or in effect may have waived their right to argue."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,896.688,900.07,"Well, you didn't raise any question like that in your petition for certiorari, did you?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,900.07,900.711,I did not.
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,900.711,901.131,No.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,901.131,901.701,That is correct.
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,901.701,908.354,"So what are we supposed to do if that's the... that's why... I mean, suppose I did think that was the correct interpretation, how should I decide this case?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,908.354,914.288,"Well, the Government moves... its position is that section 3553(e) motion is necessary."
1995.95-5661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,939.857,948.812,"I have a question that I don't think will bear on the outcome of the case, but I think it's a necessary predicate for understanding the scheme here."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,979.642,980.533,Absolutely not.
1995.95-5661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,982.182,987.577,Where does the Commission get the authority to tell the court that the court cannot depart downward in such an instance?
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,987.577,1000.976,"--Under section 994(n), Congress directed the Commission to avouch that to create a scheme for dealing with rewarding substantial assistance, and Congress came up with, or the Commission came up with this scheme for departure."
1995.95-5661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.976,1009.251,"And you think 994(n), you concede that 994(n) authorizes the Commission to require a Government motion before there can be a downward departure under the guidelines for cooperation?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1009.251,1010.553,994(n) does not.
1995.95-5661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1016.798,1026.443,All it says is that the Commission shall ensure the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower standard to take into account a defendant's substantial assistance.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1038.219,1039.06,Yes.
1995.95-5661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1039.06,1059.514,"And I suppose you can say, well, the Commission is simply borrowing from the statute to assume that the Justice Department has a sufficient interest here that there can be no departure absent its motion, but I seriously question whether or not the judge is prohibited from downward departure absent the Government's motion in a guidelines case."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1066.268,1066.809,"Yes, it does."
1995.95-5661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.369,1078.166,But it doesn't... 5K1.1 doesn't say it's the exclusive way to get a downward departure for substantial assistance.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1116.862,1117.182,--Yes.
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1119.724,1121.053,Justice Kennedy doesn't think that--
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1153.294,1153.744,No.
1995.95-5661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.744,1154.425,He does not.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1154.425,1156.827,Under section 5K1.1 there has to be a Government motion.
1995.95-5661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.468,1162.4,"You read it as being exclusive, just the opposite of what Justice Breyer said."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1183.185,1186.436,--I'm not aware of any case that has addressed--
1995.95-5661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.436,1187.337,No.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1187.337,1188.449,"--that issue, no."
1995.95-5661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1217.017,1237.61,"Mr. Mullin, suppose the Commission should say, we understand there's some confusion about this downward departure for cooperation, so now we're going to speak clearly, and we're going to say the discretion is with the prosecutor, 1) to go below the guidelines, 2) to go below the mandatory minimum."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1273.504,1288.365,"Is Your Honor's question... if I can rephrase it, is Your Honor's question if the Commission decided to establish a two-track system for a motion, one motion from the guidelines and a second motion below?"
1995.95-5661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.365,1289.544,Not numbering the motions.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1309.648,1314.17,"Under those circumstances, then we would have a different case than we have now."
1995.95-5661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1317.753,1327.468,"So essentially, then, you're arguing that we have an ambiguous statutory scheme, the Sentencing Commission could go either way on it, whatever way it goes the court should follow?"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1327.468,1345.561,"--Yes, I don't know if it was... I don't know if ambiguous is the right term, but the Congress said to the Commission, here's what we want you to do, do it, and what the Commission did under 5K1.1 was to establish a scheme, and it was a single motion scheme that they set up to deal with departures for substantial assistance."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1345.561,1354.997,I gather the court of appeals had some doubt as to whether it... the Commission could have gone either way on this question.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1370.979,1371.68,53(e).
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.68,1372.12,53(e).
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1372.12,1377.045,"They raised some question about it, but then they focused on what the Commission actually did."
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.045,1382.998,"Mr. Mullin, you're not relying on any language in the operative portion of 5K1.1."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1407.444,1413.398,"Justice Scalia, that is correct, and that is the operative language, departure from the guidelines."
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.646,1427.977,"Right, nothing that limits it, but nothing that approves departure from something else, either."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1431.821,1434.562,"--That is correct, but bear in mind--"
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.562,1437.543,"And then as a reminder, it's set forth in the application note."

1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.322,1477.369,"I'm sure it's just as authoritative, but the question that we're discussing here is whether the operative portion of 5K1.1 was meant to establish a one-tier system, as you call it--"
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1477.369,1477.679,--Yes.
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.679,1490.068,"--to make one motion do the work of two, and for that purpose, whatever the application notes say, it seems to me you look to the text of it, and that text does not suggest that it's a two-tier system."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1510.591,1510.942,That's correct.
1995.95-5661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.942,1511.372,Yes.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1511.372,1511.863,That's correct.
1995.95-5661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.863,1516.705,So the term guidelines itself embraces both the broader category and the subcategory.
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1516.705,1519.536,"That is correct, and section 5G1.1 is a perfect example."
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.2,1537.469,"Very well, Mr. Mullin."
1995.95-5661,0,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,1537.469,1538.109,Thank you.
1995.95-5661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.109,1539.449,"Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1539.449,1551.608,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-5661,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.663,1591.525,Is the one a subgroup of the other?
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1600.801,1602.27,"No, you do not."
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.27,1604.474,"No, but the converse is what's the subcategory... yes."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1604.474,1637.824,"The converse is true, but to address Justice Stevens' point, what the Commission has said in application Note 1 is that the only time you can do that is under the circumstances set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553 (e), so it sends you back to the statute, and what you have to decide is what is the meaning of the statute, and it says that, upon motion of the Government, a court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance."
1995.95-5661,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1637.824,1661.149,"Well, could the Commission expressly adopt a rule that says, we will deem a Government motion asking the court to consider the defendant's substantial assistance to be a motion that satisfies 3553(e) as well as any guideline?"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1661.149,1662.631,We do not think it could.
1995.95-5661,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1696.883,1697.323,It didn't?
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1697.323,1698.375,"No, it didn't."
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.375,1701.307,Because I thought that what it could have said was this.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1745.996,1750.108,"I think I would distinguish the two situations, again, where the Commission--"
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1750.108,1751.37,I understand that they're different.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1752.739,1761.655,"--And what I would say that what the Commission cannot say is that a motion for a departure from the guidelines is, ipso facto--"
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1761.655,1762.676,Of course you're right.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1763.327,1763.585,"--Okay, and now--"
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1763.585,1775.763,"--Now, but then the question becomes, did it choose to allow the departure from the guidelines only where, under 5K1.1, there is the statutory animal?"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1806.965,1809.697,--I... we disagree.
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1809.697,1811.537,"Well, I know that, but I'm looking for the argument."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1811.537,1812.318,And now I'll explain why.
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1819.414,1820.763,"Oh, no, it's more words than that."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1820.763,1826.327,"--Well, let me start just, that was part of what was similar, and I'll take one bit of it at a time."
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.137,1889.528,"May I interrupt... may I, just with this one thought, concentrating on the words, substantial assistance, you are in effect arguing there are two kinds of substantial assistance, one that justifies a departure from the statute, and the other just justifies a guideline departure, but there's nothing in the text of either document that describes two kinds of substantial assistance."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1889.528,1891.439,--And I'm not saying there are two kinds.
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.706,1915.135,"Yes, but the... well, let me just interrupt you."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1928.905,1950.159,"--But on the statutory minimum sentences the Government is perfectly free to take into account that the defendant has engaged in serious conduct and, notwithstanding that he may be giving substantial assistance, we're not going to reward that substantial assistance for somebody who has a 16 to 20-year guideline sentence with something that goes below the statutory minimum."
1995.95-5661,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.159,1968.63,"Mr. Gornstein, I was surprised to hear you agree with Justice Breyer that the Commission could establish a rule, we will allow no departure below the guidelines unless there is also a departure below the minimum."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1969.671,1970.042,That--
1995.95-5661,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.042,1970.953,--the Commission could do that.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1970.953,1972.133,--The Commission could do that.
1995.95-5661,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.664,1990.475,"Would that be in accordance with the requirement of section 994(n) that it assure... assure... that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is... including a sentence that is lower... to take into account a defendant's substantial assistance."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2002.854,2016.422,"--Well, we think the Commission would have that authority under 994(n), because we think it would satisfy the charge that it provide... that it's generally... for the general appropriateness of departures before the guidelines, because in--"
1995.95-5661,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.422,2024.487,What relevance does the Government's unwillingness to go below the minimum have to do with the appropriateness of reducing it within the guidelines above the minimum?
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2025.849,2033.673,"--Well, I think that in a large category of cases the Government would be willing to do both, so you are talking about a discrete category of cases--"
1995.95-5661,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.673,2034.254,"--Well, I know that, but--"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2034.254,2035.436,--where the Government--
1995.95-5661,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.436,2036.675,--that's no justification for treating them irrationally.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2036.675,2042.94,"--Well, I think that it doesn't have much to recommend it, and we wouldn't advise the Commission to do something like that--"
1995.95-5661,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.94,2047.803,"Well, I wouldn't advise you to accept the proposition, because number 1, it hurts your case, and number 2, it doesn't seem to me to be there in the statute."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2114.066,2120.561,"--The difficulty there, Justice Souter, is there are... the difference in perspective between the Government and the court."
1995.95-5661,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2128.895,2131.076,"Which was... as it was under the old law, as it were."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2131.076,2132.618,And... but I... and I--
1995.95-5661,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2132.618,2134.058,That's always been true.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2140.122,2144.916,--But I think what that translates into is the behavior of the prosecutor as he makes the deal.
1995.95-5661,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.338,2164.079,"Yes, but couldn't you--"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2169.103,2169.28,That's right.
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2171.684,2177.869,"But isn't there a possible answer to that, and that's why both Justices... I don't know if this why Justice Kennedy asked the question, but his question raises this."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2201.823,2204.925,"--Well, yes, 3553(e) would certainly preclude the court from--"
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.925,2205.886,He couldn't go below the minimum--
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2205.886,2206.477,--That's right.
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.477,2208.256,"--no, no, but he could go below the guidelines."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2208.256,2211.84,"Well, no, 5K1.1 requires a Government motion to go below the guidelines."
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.84,2212.22,That's true--
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2215.072,2217.553,"Well, we read 5K1.1--"
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.553,2224.419,You read that as disabling that possible solution which would protect your interest and keep the scheme alive that you're arguing for.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2224.419,2227.23,"--Well, 5K1.1 simply doesn't leave that option open."
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.23,2228.019,Okay.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2228.019,2232.753,And our interest is better protected by affirming the judgment in the court of appeals in this case.
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.753,2233.775,Mr. Gornstein--
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2251.955,2253.297,Without the consent--
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.297,2254.906,"Without the consent of the United States, in a guidelines case."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2256.288,2263.732,"--Well, I think 994(n) gives the Commission authority, general authority to decide how to proceed with substantial--"
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.732,2267.075,"No, it just says it should provide assurance, I think is what it says."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2267.075,2269.977,"--That's right, but I think beyond that the Commission generally has authority--"
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2269.977,2272.829,To assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2280.755,2281.256,--No.
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2288.209,2290.4,That there be a veto power in the United States Attorney's Office.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2290.4,2290.87,That's correct.
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2290.87,2292.332,I don't find that under the statute.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2309.714,2310.425,That's correct.
1995.95-5661,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2310.425,2327.495,"And I... one question I had about the current status of the Sentencing Commission's thinking on this subject, is there not ongoing some kind of review within the Commission of substantial cooperation departures?"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2327.495,2329.256,There is not.
1995.95-5661,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.256,2330.358,There is not?
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2330.358,2349.118,"There is a study currently under way not addressing this particular problem, but the Commission has a study underway studying how substantial assistance departures have worked out in practice, and there is a preliminary report, not a final report, that--"
1995.95-5661,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2349.118,2350.49,But it doesn't touch this problem at all.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2350.49,2351.151,"--No, it does not."
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2351.151,2357.914,"Is there any indication... I mean, there are circuits, most of them, perhaps, or some of them that just have the one motion rule, the Second Circuit, I think, right?"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2357.914,2360.928,There are four circuits that have ruled against us in this case.
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.928,2374.186,"And has there turned out to be a problem, a practical problem that's led you perhaps to think of asking the Commission to create a kind of substantial assistance light, a 5K1.1 light, if you were to... you know, that--"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2374.186,2382.521,"We actually have been involved legislatively, but that is on hold pending the outcome of this case."
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2382.521,2388.584,"--Has the Commission considered it at... I mean, you could... there's nothing... it's not illogical to have a 5K1.1 light."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2395.731,2397.561,We have not gone to the Commission with this.
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2407.218,2425.938,"--Could you tell me, counsel, are there many cases in which this undertaking, this promise by the Government to move downward, either under the guidelines or the sentence, is made in the field during part of the investigation, or is this usually just done with a plea bargain after the defendant has counsel, et cetera?"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2425.938,2426.369,Right.
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2428.311,2432.513,Never in the field in this--
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2432.513,2433.445,I wouldn't... I don't want to say never.
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2434.566,2435.124,--Almost always.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2435.124,2436.476,--at the plea bargaining stage.
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.476,2459.501,"If you're finished, I do have a... suppose I did think... I mean, I put these questions more forcefully, often, than I... when I'm accually uncertain, but if it turned out that I did think that the 5K1.1 is meant to pick up the statutory animal, you know, what I've been saying, still, it would be up to the Government to say what kind of motion they've made."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2466.066,2467.195,That the consequence--
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.195,2467.536,--Yes.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2467.536,2470.588,--if you're saying that it requires a motion to go below the statutory minimum--
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2470.588,2471.078,"Yes, but that--"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2471.078,2475.763,"--then the consequence in this case is the court had no authority, and then--"
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.763,2479.234,"--So we would affirm, but then you might be in violation of the plea agreement."
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2480.706,2484.987,--I think our plea agreement only committed us to file a motion under the guidelines.
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.987,2485.348,That's--
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2485.348,2485.979,Which we did.

1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2519.1,2519.601,That's right.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2519.601,2521.992,If we were going to address what the plea--
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.992,2522.743,I don't want to address it.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2522.743,2523.134,--Okay.
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.134,2524.393,"I just want to know, how would we decide--"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2524.694,2525.105,It's not here.
1995.95-5661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2525.105,2525.856,--How in your opinion--
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2528.497,2531.589,"If the issue were here, or not?"
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2559.546,2579.669,"Is the office of the Commission to issue a policy statement helping courts interpret what motions are, that there's a presumption that if you make the motion without distinguishing between the two that it means both guidelines and statutes, but that you still have the option to be more specific?"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2579.669,2582.062,We don't think that the Commission does have that role.
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.242,2620.608,May I ask how you would deal with the following motion: motion of the Government for a sentence which will appropriately reflect the defendant's substantial assistance with the Government--
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2620.608,2622.06,That would be a very--
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.06,2626.761,"--and attach... yes, but supposing that was the way it was phrased, would the judge have any authority or not--"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2626.761,2627.222,--No.
1995.95-5661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.222,2628.063,--to go below... you think not.
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2628.063,2641.632,"Right, because I think that the statutory minimum penalties are so important, and were deemed so important by Congress, that you really need a very explicit and clear statement by the Government that it is seeking a sentence below the statutory minimum."
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2663.146,2667.448,Do you think the Justice Department ought to have sort of a Miranda warning in its plea agreements:
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2670.119,2673.431,"Well, I think after the Court decides this case, everyone will know."
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2674.924,2681.128,"Well, would you object to having a Miranda warning in every plea agreement just in case someone doesn't?"
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2681.128,2684.361,We would object to including that sort of thing.
1995.95-5661,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2684.361,2689.814,Why would you object to informing the defendant of the fact that he may be trapped by your plea agreement?
1995.95-5661,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2689.814,2691.825,It's not a matter of objecting.
1995.95-5661,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2709.125,2710.417,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
1995.95-5661,2,38158,patrick_a_mullin,,2711.988,2714.308,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I know I have a couple of minutes."
