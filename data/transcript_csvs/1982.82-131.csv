1982.82-131,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.436,We will hear arguments next in Jones and Laughlin Steel against Pfeifer.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,63.209,67.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.634,335.038,That would be traditional in those workmen's compensation type claims.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,354.812,355.921,"I think, Justice O'Connor--"
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.921,359.529,Do you think that we were in error in Edmonds?
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,359.529,362.073,"--I believe you are in error, yes."
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.912,376.834,But it was a pretty clear statement.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,382.722,399.996,"There is in the legislation history as it appears, although the amendments to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act are still pending, they have set forth the case of Griffith versus Wheeling-Pittsburgh as being something that was not intended from the 1972 amendments."
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,845.301,847.081,"--Mr. Murdoch, just to clarify one point."
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,856.062,858.123,"That is correct, that was not raised, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,858.123,858.327,All right.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,858.327,878.896,"I would like to point out on that, though, that the finding of negligence, if you want to look at a dual capacity, was not made clear because, although it was a finding of negligence as the owner pro hac vice, it did not make a distinction as to whether or not there was a finding of negligence as an employer or as a vessel."
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.551,886.675,"But for our purposes, we assume that there was negligence as a vessel owner; right?"
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,886.675,889.705,"No, I don't think we can assume that."
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,899.077,899.405,Right.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,900.842,901.374,That's right.
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,901.374,902.263,--that you want to raise.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,902.263,902.763,Yes.
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,902.763,905.512,So I am assuming that we must assume that is the case.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,905.512,906.293,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-131,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,906.293,907.231,The issue just isn't here.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,907.231,908.918,"I am sorry, i did not hear."
1982.82-131,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,908.918,910.262,The just isn't here.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,910.262,913.292,On the particular 905(b)?
1982.82-131,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,913.292,915.15,The issue of negligence is not here.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,916.291,921.115,"In what way, i don't understand, I'm sorry, Justice Blackmun."
1982.82-131,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,921.115,931.736,Your colloquy with Justice O'Connor indicated that the issue is not here.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,931.736,933.626,I believe the issue is here.
1982.82-131,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,953.447,956.992,But we are not to pass on the issue of negligence.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,956.992,960.616,"That is correct, that was not raised at the time of the argument."
1982.82-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1283.861,1295.636,"So under your view, you start with the reduction of the award to present value, and then permit it to be augmented by testimony as to increased wages?"
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1295.636,1300.525,"I think we would do it sort of backwards, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1312.239,1322.703,"So what the jury ought to do is to consider that testimony as to future earnings, perhaps higher wage rates or promotions in the future."
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1330.998,1331.341,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1449.232,1458.915,"The SG has filed a brief in this case on the damages question suggesting, I think a different approach than you are suggesting if I understand it correctly."
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1458.915,1459.4,That is correct.
1982.82-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.4,1476.017,"And one that would propose that perhaps it's all right to consider the inflationary factors, both as applied to the discount element and as applied to the prospective wage increase."
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1486.232,1496.026,"As far as what they have suggested, they were talking specifically about what would be the Feldman case and the Doca case where they had an adjusted discount rate."
1982.82-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.837,1611.665,"I have a question, Mr. Murdoch, if I may."
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1611.665,1612.462,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.462,1621.177,"The calculation of the award in this case as set forth in the red brief, on page 17 they explain how they the $275,000."
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1632.423,1633.033,"No, they didn't."
1982.82-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.033,1634.579,"Why not, I don't understand."
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1634.579,1642.295,"The $33,000 which is subtracted there was the compensation payments we had made from the date of injury--"
1982.82-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1642.295,1642.795,Right.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1642.795,1643.433,--to the date of trial.
1982.82-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.433,1652.368,"Why wouldn't they also... If they subtracted an amount for the minimum wage, why wouldn't they also subtract... Was that or maybe that wasn't raised?"
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1652.368,1652.821,I am sorry.
1982.82-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.632,1660.069,Correct.
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1660.069,1661.396,"Then the $33,000."
1982.82-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.396,1667.409,"But the minimum wage, this $66,000, as I understand it, is the minimum he would have earned in the future."
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1667.409,1668.518,"Over the 12 years, yes sir."
1982.82-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1668.518,1673.454,Why wouldn't they also subtract 12 years of future workmen's compensation payments?
1982.82-131,0,39890,robert_w_murdoch,,1673.454,1688.401,"What the Court indicated was going to happen was that if in fact there was going to be an appeal at the time there was a final decision in this case, that we would then make a determination as to what had been paid at that time."
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,1798.231,1813.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.658,2377.7,"The burden of proof... Mr. Libenson, isn't the burden of proof as to the amount of damages he is entitled to recover on someone in Mr. Pfeifer's shoes?"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2377.7,2384.839,"The initial burden, but if they were going to contest the award, they have to offer their own evidence, Your Honor."
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.839,2390.882,Granted that they can't rely on any testimony other than that already adduced.
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2402.706,2403.206,I agree.
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.533,2445.579,Let's return to your waiver point.
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2445.579,2446.11,Okay.
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.11,2456.044,"Supposing that after precisely the same testimony as was adduced here, which I take it was your expert on the question of damages--"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2456.044,2456.7,"We had no expert, Your Honor."
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.7,2458.105,--Who was it?
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2458.105,2459.152,There was no expert.
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.712,2467.087,"Supposing that Judge Cohill had then said,"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2479.159,2480.923,He didn't do that.
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.923,2490.671,"I realize that, but do you think that the Defendant would be prevented from urging on appeal that Judge Cohill had applied the wrong measure of damages simply because the Defendant--"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2490.671,2496.324,"You are presupposing, Justice Rehnquist, that he went outside the record which he did not do, and that is my point."
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.324,2501.822,"--But the rule, the law of damages doesn't necessarily depend on the record."
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2506.071,2526.234,"I would like to... If I could answer your question by directing your attention or inviting your attention to the Alma case against Manufacturers Hanover Trust in the Ninth Circuit, which stated that in the absence of evidence on the reduction by either side, the Court is not obligated to go ahead sua sponte to do it."
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2526.234,2530.856,But the Third Circuit did go ahead here and considered various rules of damages.
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2530.856,2554.956,"I think the Third Circuit did essentially what the Ninth Circuit did in Alma, it addressed the record in front of it and what it did was say that whether or not the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act considered inflation and whether or not there was Federal law as precedent at that time."
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2563.265,2573.636,"But the Third Circuit, unless I wholly misread its opinion, affirmatively adopted a rather sweeping change in the law of damages in this kind of case at least for that circuit."
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2574.713,2587.709,I don't dispute it but I think the answer is that there was no law of damages in a fixed manner at that time.
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.176,2601.266,But it certainly wasn't a rule of damages applicable to only these particular facts and only this particular case.
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2605.546,2616.464,I think it was discretionary.
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.464,2618.557,What was discretionary?
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2618.557,2624.305,For the Third Circuit to adopt the Kaczkowski case and a total offset.
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.305,2629.303,"It may have been discretionary, but they exercised their discretion to adopt it."
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2629.303,2636.612,"That is true, but I think there was room for it because there was nothing in the Federal law at that time that directed them any other way."
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.612,2638.392,But now it is the law of the Third Circuit.
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2647.67,2657.276,"My argument... The waiver goes to the fact that I don't think the petitioner can ask for a reduction to present worth at this point in time because it is not in the record, that is my point, Your Honor."
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2657.276,2668.27,"If the rule, the yardstick that the Third Circuit applied is not warranted and justified, what about that?"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2668.27,2674.362,If they had other evidence before it from which they could argue but to say that it is not warranted--
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2674.362,2675.19,Isn't that just a matter of evidence?
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2675.19,2676.425,"--That is right, Your Honor."
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.425,2678.174,Don't you think that they made a new rule?
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2678.174,2687.076,I don't think they were entitled to make a new rule under the state of the law as it was before them at the time that this case was presented to them.
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.386,2696.338,"The question is whether made the correct rule of law on measuring damages, is it not."
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2696.338,2698.431,"I am sorry, I didn't hear."
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.431,2703.773,"Whether they made the correct rule of law to measure the damages, and that is a question of law and not a question of fact."
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2703.773,2714.94,"That is true, but a law evolves from facts and I think a court has to have facts in front of it before it can make law."
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2714.94,2720.811,"On what facts do you think the Third Circuit evolved, to use your term, their rule?"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2720.811,2721.28,All right.
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2762.186,2774.681,Does this involve an assumption that inflation is always going to remain in the state that it is on the day or at the time the Court of Appeals is evolving its new rule?
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2774.681,2782.865,"I think that the history of inflation is recognized by all circuits at this point, but the First."
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2794.159,2798.046,Do you think we can take judicial notice that it has been decreasing lately?
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2798.046,2800.203,That is one of the problems in the case.
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2801.952,2804.074,"But it has, has it not?"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2804.074,2805.262,Pardon.
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.262,2807.199,Has it not gone down?
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2807.199,2808.183,"Yes, but it is a variable thing."
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2819.757,2822.63,"What was it in 1980, about 11 percent or 12 percent?"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2822.63,2824.88,"It was runaway inflation at that time, that is right."
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.732,2844.34,"That is a separate and different matter, isn't?"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,2844.34,2846.464,"It is a different issue, but I think it illustrates the problem, Your Honor."
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.893,3072.983,"Mr. Libenson, you intimated a moment ago that you thought the Third Circuit was reviewing the District Court's damage award on kind of an abuse of discretion theory."
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,3093.318,3105.11,"Your question again, is this a fair interpretation?"
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3105.11,3117.043,"Is it a fair interpretation to say that all the Court of Appeals was saying it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to have applied this rule, intimating that perhaps if the District Court had applied another rule, it would have affirmed it, too."
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,3117.043,3121.055,I think so.
1982.82-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.561,3158.166,"Well, if he felt that it was superior, then is it really fair to say that it is a review on an abuse of discretion basis, and that if Judge Cohill had applied any one of five or six other rules, you think that would have been affirmed, too?"
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,3158.166,3161.4,I think so.
1982.82-131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.4,3175.113,May I ask you if you know whether this problem of how to compute damages in an inflationary economy has ever been addressed by any legislature?
1982.82-131,1,31375,jerome_m_libenson,,3175.113,3180.953,"I am not aware of any, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3180.953,3192.012,Were any arguments made to any of the courts along the line that something like a cost of living adjustment could be built into an award?
