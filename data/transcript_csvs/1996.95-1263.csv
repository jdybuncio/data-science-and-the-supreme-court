1996.95-1263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.618,"We'll hear argument now in No. 95-1263, Caterpillar, Inc. v. James David Lewis."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,9.79,13.913,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,108.565,112.696,"He was right at that point, was he not, because Whayne was still in the litigation."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,118.052,118.259,--Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,118.259,119.811,--and the case should have been remanded.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,120.452,124.825,"That was obviously a disputed issue, but as the case comes to this Court, that's correct."
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.825,129.268,"Well, I think we have to assume this, and he made a timely objection."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,130.459,132.491,He made a motion to remand.
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.07,133.551,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,133.551,134.142,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.142,142.837,"And I don't know if it's all that clear whether an interlocutory appeal would ever lie at that point, is it?"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,142.837,144.617,From the denial of the motion to remand?
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.315,166.391,"But in any event, presumably having made the objection and motion in a timely fashion, it should be reserved for review on appeal."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,166.391,173.257,"--If the error had not been cured, I think there would be an argument that the issue should be reserved for appeal."
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.257,185.764,"Well, but of course the claim is that there was prejudice here because of different rules on what evidence can come in and because of the non-unanimous jury in Kentucky and so forth."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,185.764,186.205,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.205,192.728,Do you think any of those procedural rules at the State level could ever amount to prejudice?
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,192.728,210.2,"Well, if the error had been objected to and not cured, which is not our case, I think there is an argument that the issue might be reserved to be argued on appeal from a final judgment, and if the error is consequential, could lead to a reversal."
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.312,216.806,"Well, but we take the case in the posture that there was an error when it wasn't--"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,216.806,217.907,"Well, the error--"
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.907,218.615,--sent to State court.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,218.615,223.861,"--The error, Justice O'Connor, was simply in removing at a time when there wasn't diversity jurisdiction."
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.861,224.121,Right.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,224.121,240.39,"It's just like this Court's case, as I hope to discuss in a few minutes, of Finn where the identical error occurred, and yet the Court said, as I'll explain, that the rule is even though that error may have occurred, if jurisdiction exists at the time of judgment in the district court, that's not... there's no ground to reverse on appeal."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.39,242.902,"But, Mr. Geller, is it not true this case has an unusual feature?"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,270.641,273.343,"Well, that's true, but there are a number of responses."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,278.796,279.917,"Yes, but there was no diversity then."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,279.917,280.228,"Well, I understand that."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,288.242,288.522,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,288.522,293.996,"And secondly, that objection was never made in the district court."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.996,298.278,The objection that was made was that there was not complete diversity.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,298.278,299.75,That was the only objection.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.75,301.75,That was a well-taken objection and you recognized that--
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,301.75,301.961,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,301.961,303.292,--you must accept that--
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,303.292,304.341,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,304.341,305.753,--for purposes of posture we're in.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,305.753,306.124,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,306.124,314.249,"My point is simply that if you had waited until Whayne was dismissed from the action, it would have been too late for you to remove."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,317.07,317.991,That is true.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.991,326.146,One other point I was glad to hear you say in your argument is that you were not relying on the failure to take an interlocutory appeal--
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,326.146,326.857,"Well, we're not--"
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.857,327.939,--from the refusal to remand.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,327.939,330.27,--We're not arguing a waiver in that sense.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.334,364.311,"But I find that an extraordinary argument, if you're making that, because 1292(b) is an exception to the very firm final judgment rule, and people aren't penalized for failing to--"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,364.311,366.474,"--Well, not... it's not a question of penalizing anyone, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.337,385.645,"--Well, it's my... if 1292 was not something that any litigant must use... and it's my understanding that it is not... then, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, a timely objection was made and that objection is preserved for--"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,385.645,386.056,--Well--
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.056,387.368,--appeal after final judgment.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,387.368,392.53,"--The only objection that was made in the motion to remand, Justice Ginsburg, was that there wasn't diversity jurisdiction."
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.211,415.706,"Suppose in this case that the removal had been after 1 year, or suppose a hypothetical case, removed after 1 year."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,422.45,425.412,"Well, first of all, that wouldn't--"
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,425.412,426.902,Let's assume complete diversity at all times.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,426.902,427.423,--Right.
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.034,428.584,But you just--
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,428.584,429.393,--There would be a statutory error.
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,442.503,444.544,--Why should that lead to a reversal on appeal?
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,444.544,444.864,--Well--
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,444.864,446.978,It seems to me the equities there are much different.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,448.206,449.957,--Well--
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.957,454.672,In your case the judgment is saved only because something happens toward the end.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,454.672,461.796,"--In that case, though, there would be a statutory error, and the question would be, is the statutory error something that should lead to a reversal on appeal?"
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.483,486.271,"Well, if that objection was well taken... and it was... if it had been... if the district judge had recognized all the circumstances in the case, why isn't that statutory?"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,489.003,500.54,"Well, the only requirement of the removal statute that would be implicated is that there be diversity jurisdiction or some other ground of Federal jurisdiction at the time the case is removed, but it's not a separate requirement of the removal statute."
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.473,512.126,"I would think that your argument is not that it's statutory versus non-statutory, but rather that it's curable versus... or rather, that its noncurable versus curable."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,512.126,512.508,Right.
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.969,516.731,"If you're late, you're late and there's no way that it can ever be made up."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,516.731,517.222,--There would still--
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.222,520.225,"Whereas, if there is no diversity, that can be altered."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,520.225,520.785,"--Well, that's right."
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.924,544.599,"I know the case isn't before us, but do you have a conclusion as to what the rule should be if the removal is, say, a day... a week after the 1-year period of trial?"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,544.599,544.939,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,573.09,576.782,"So, what you're saying is that these matters basically are to be left to the district courts."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,576.782,587.037,"I think that these... this may be a category of error in which the plaintiff's remedy, even if it's not cured, would be with the district judge and you wouldn't want to reverse a Federal judgment based on them."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,597.025,605.149,"Well, Mr. Geller, what wasn't completely cured was that there was a removal at a time when there was no statutory right to a removal."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,628.394,629.415,"Justice Ginsburg, we're not relying--"
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,629.415,630.126,--so you're losing out on something.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,630.126,630.605,--Excuse me.
1996.95-1263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,645.455,661.757,"What you are assuming, it seems to me, and might have said to Justice Ginsburg is that although the statutory error in one sense exists forever, the only real interest that is at stake here is an Article III jurisdictional interest."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,675.324,678.797,"That would be the nub of what we're saying if there was in fact a statutory error here, but there wasn't."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,689.103,693.116,There was an error in removing the case when there wasn't complete diversity.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,693.116,695.128,"That was the only error, the jurisdictional error."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,695.128,701.792,And the district court... if we could just peel away what should not be in the dispute and then argue from there.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,715.533,715.84,Right.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,715.84,716.491,If we could just--
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,716.491,716.942,That is--
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,716.942,717.913,--say that that's a given--
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,717.913,718.284,--That's the fact.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,718.284,718.692,--and go on from there.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,718.692,718.962,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,733.813,734.845,With one exception.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,740.347,745.72,It wasn't but... I'll say it one last time and then we can... that 1-year provision was not violated in this case.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.483,750.494,"Mr. Geller, then I will say it one more time."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,750.494,750.905,Okay.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.514,760.821,"If you had waited until it was proper to remove, you could not have removed because the 1-year period would have run."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,763.412,763.722,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,763.722,769.987,"--and didn't try to remove until you had complete diversity, you could not have removed because the one--"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,769.987,770.228,That's true.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,770.228,775.27,--And the difference in Finn is that 1-year provision was not part of the law at the time of Finn.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,775.27,789.919,"Well, first of all, even assuming there was this distinct statutory error, apart from the jurisdiction error, it's not an error that the plaintiff has ever alleged or preserved until his merits brief in this Court."
1996.95-1263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.159,808.683,Was it raised in the brief in opposition to certiorari?
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,808.683,808.943,No.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,830.657,833.259,"Yes, it was satisfied here and there's no doubt about that."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,833.259,833.549,--Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.869,843.634,"But the point I'm making is that if you had not removed at a time when there wasn't complete diversity, you could have not have removed later."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,845.605,845.906,I accept that point.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,845.906,848.349,--the scene and I don't think it's genuinely arguable.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,848.349,849.078,Fine.
1996.95-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.883,871.915,You don't mean it's precisely like the Finn case.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,872.833,873.464,--Like the rule--
1996.95-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.464,875.167,--the way you interpret a sentence in the Finn opinion.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,875.167,878.399,"--Well, except what happened in Finn, Justice Stevens, it's--"
1996.95-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.399,882.13,"And you should be relying on the cases that sentence cites, except they all went the other way."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,885.272,886.394,"--Well, there are a lot of--"
1996.95-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.394,888.345,--take advantage of the error.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,888.345,891.597,--The rule announced in Finn... it's true that in Finn the Court--
1996.95-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.597,894.769,"You're relying on a sentence in Finn, not the holding in Finn."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,894.769,896.81,"--Well, I believe we can debate whether it's the holding."
1996.95-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.202,899.442,It's certainly not the holding because the case went the other way.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,899.442,911.789,"--Well, but what happened in Finn is that the Court also said, of course, on remand this problem can be cured by dismissing the non-diverse defendant, and that is of course precisely what happened on remand in Finn."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,939.819,954.689,"Mr. Geller, do you see a difference between a plaintiff who prevails in such a case, the plaintiff not having brought the case to the Federal court, and the defendant... the plaintiff was the one who was resisting removal because the plaintiff doesn't remove."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,955.32,955.487,Right.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,955.487,962.664,And when a defendant removes and the removal... there was no basis for the removal at the time?
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,982.697,994.884,"The rule announced in Finn doesn't draw the distinction between the plaintiff or the defendant, and notions of consent or waiver or things like that seem to have no relevance, it seems to us, when the defect is a jurisdictional defect."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1069.326,1073.368,I don't see that because the plaintiff has a choice of forum.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1088.787,1091.068,"--Well, this Court relied on rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1091.068,1093.212,"--Well, is there not a provision in title 28 to that effect, that you can--"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1093.212,1094.561,I don't believe so.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1094.561,1094.992,--you can cure it?
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1094.992,1096.143,This Court didn't cite any provision.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.103,1099.955,"Well, I don't remember the number of it, but I think you will find that--"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1099.955,1100.345,But--
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1100.345,1101.196,--there is such a provision.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1101.196,1102.258,--Well.
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.258,1106.299,"In any event, it's the plaintiff... isn't there this difference, Mr. Geller?"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1120.889,1126.942,"Well, it's true that the plaintiff has the initial choice of forum but that doesn't trump every other rule."
1996.95-1263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1189.183,1193.247,"Mr. Geller, on your reasoning it wouldn't have mattered even if there was no diversity jurisdiction during trial."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1197.288,1198.8,"--Well, Finn talks about both."
1996.95-1263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1207.104,1209.976,"Well, if it can be cured after appeal--"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1209.976,1211.208,It would seem that if it could be--
1996.95-1263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1211.208,1219.002,"--then I would suppose it would follow that if it was cured, let's say, after trial but at some point prior to a remand on appeal, it would be enough."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1219.002,1220.044,"--I think that's right, Justice Souter."
1996.95-1263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1231.394,1248.704,"So, if the... if you do take the position that so long as it's cured even after trial but before judgment, does it follow that any of the claims of harm here, if we should get to a harmful error analysis, really would be beside the point?"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1248.704,1253.249,The Court has not engaged in any harmful error analysis in any of these cases.
1996.95-1263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1253.249,1254.35,And it would be inappropriate on your theory.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1254.35,1254.58,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1254.58,1254.981,Wouldn't it?
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1254.981,1255.362,Yes.
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1256.972,1261.266,Although you admitted in response to my question that some errors could be prejudicial.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1261.266,1262.827,--Well--
1996.95-1263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1262.827,1270.372,"That's what I asked you, and that means that there are some situations that would permit the conducting of a harmless error analysis."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1270.372,1273.554,"--Well, I don't think in this situation the Court has ever done that."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1306.564,1313.069,"Mr. Geller, wouldn't 28 U.S.C. 1653 take care of your Newman-Green case, which you say is just like that one?"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1331.572,1336.353,"Well, the Court in Newman-Green rejected reliance on section 1653 is recollection."
1996.95-1263,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1336.353,1336.844,Oh.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1340.658,1342.067,I said rule 21.
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.72,1346.782,1653 applies only to allegations in jurisdiction.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1346.782,1346.992,--Allegations.
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.992,1348.442,Defective allegations of jurisdiction.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1348.442,1348.663,Right.
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.663,1349.474,Right?
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1349.474,1349.844,Right.
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.844,1350.924,Not defective jurisdiction.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1350.924,1351.404,"Right, exactly."
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.606,1355.026,"It was the basis for Justice Kennedy's dissent, as a matter of fact, in Newman-Green, wasn't it?"
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1355.026,1359.598,"Well, the debate, as I recollect, in Newman-Green between the majority and the dissent was--"
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.598,1378.863,"The dissent was since Congress felt it necessary to explicitly provide for amending even a defective allegation of jurisdiction, it would seem clear that defective jurisdiction cannot be amended, there being no statute providing for that."
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1378.863,1381.794,--That was the position of the dissent in Newman-Green.
1996.95-1263,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.794,1382.605,It was a pretty good position.
1996.95-1263,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1382.605,1384.848,"It was an excellent dissent, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1474.927,1476.008,"Very well, Mr. Geller."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1478.74,1482.182,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.501,1529.832,"As far as that latter point goes, when we granted certiorari in the case, we didn't know that that was an issue, and I doubt whether we would have granted certiorari to decide an issue that is so narrow; that is to say, if you remove within the time period, but that removal is invalid, can a later remedying of the jurisdictional defect preserve the judgment."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1560.643,1561.704,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.704,1563.975,Why didn't you do that when the petition was filed instead of now?
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1563.975,1573.982,"Well, Your Honor, I guess as a practical matter I don't do a whole lot of work in Federal court and wasn't intimately aware of the removal statute."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1579.154,1581.516,"Are you familiar with our rule 15, Mr. Stayton?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1581.516,1581.916,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.916,1587.53,"And that if you don't raise it in the brief in opposition, it will be deemed waived... it may be deemed waived?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1587.53,1587.981,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1587.981,1589.37,"Well, what's your response to that?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1589.37,1594.245,"My response to that, Your Honor, if you want to follow that argument, then the argument of the petitioner is also raised."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.979,1607.562,But the... did the court of appeals make any response other than just a denial?
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1607.562,1608.493,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.493,1615.639,"But the rule 15 deals with our own treatment of a case, not with what the court of appeals may have said."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1615.639,1616.257,That's correct.
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.257,1631.047,"And as you agree, I take it, if you don't raise something like that in a brief in opposition, we may be taking a case, as Justice Scalia says, which has something that will prevent us from reaching the issue that the petitioner presents."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1633.88,1644.498,"That's correct, Your Honor, but this Court also held in Hanson v. Denckla that in cases such as... or in arguments such as the petitioner has made, that if it fails to make that argument in the court below, it also waives that argument before this Court."
1996.95-1263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.793,1674.338,"Mr. Stayton, how far do you carry that?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1694.21,1701.683,"Well, I think in that case, since the defendant has the... made the election to have the case removed to Federal court, it would have waived its argument that--"
1996.95-1263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.683,1705.226,But subject matter jurisdiction is something the court has to raise on its own motion.
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1705.226,1706.388,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1727.512,1736.728,"What... on the assumption that the court had raised it, would you be standing here saying, you're right, you got to wipe it all out, send it back, try it in another court?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1736.728,1737.489,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.725,1814.44,"Mr. Stayton, let me... this case seems to me almost an a fortiori case of Newman-Green in this respect."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1846.039,1847.261,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.261,1856.718,"Doesn't that indicate that Congress wants this, more than the normal suit that's involved in Newman-Green, to be an area where this matter is taken care of at the district court?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1863.133,1876.85,"I don't agree, Your Honor, because in 1447 the Court specifically stated that if subject matter jurisdiction is noted to be absent at any time before final judgment, then the case shall be remanded, which I believe makes a mandatory requirement upon the--"
1996.95-1263,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.85,1878.961,But that... but that's of necessity.
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1888.458,1896.783,"--I don't agree, Your Honor, because 1447 specifically states that the case shall be remanded if there's no subject matter jurisdiction, as happened in this case."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.783,1902.446,"But you're not suggesting that would happen even without a motion to remand, are you?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1911.733,1912.774,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1935.368,1939.021,You did make a timely motion to remand.
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1939.021,1940.471,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.428,1961.575,"And it may be that Congress wanted cases remanded to the State court to be left there, but didn't have the same attitude about keeping a case in the Federal court that shouldn't be there."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1961.575,1963.217,"I believe you may be correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1963.217,1967.999,"But if that is so, and it appears to be so, why should that be?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,1978.027,1984.853,"In my opinion, the Congress has recognized the rights of the States to determine their own matters."
1996.95-1263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1987.203,1989.644,"Well, but this isn't a matter of the rights of States."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2004.624,2006.786,--I don't know if I understand your question completely.
1996.95-1263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2006.786,2013.52,"Well, if the remand motion is granted, there's no appeal."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2038.105,2045.231,"Well, I believe it must be a balancing act of Congress with regard to the right of the Federal judiciary versus the State judiciary, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2067.434,2074.36,"No, but you can't even get an interlocutory appeal in the case... in the instance in which it's... the remand motion is improperly granted."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2074.36,2074.991,--That's correct.
1996.95-1263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2074.991,2096.902,Don't you think the distinction and that one good argument might be for the disparity of treatment is that what Congress was really concerned about was the fear that a Federal court might he exercising Article III... or be purporting to exercise jurisdiction when it had no Article III diversity jurisdiction and that that's the reason for the diversity?
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2096.902,2098.034,"You may be correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1263,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2098.034,2115.456,"But if that is correct, then doesn't it follow that if that Article III jurisdictional problem is cured before judgment, that there should not be a reversal on appeal for the fact alone that prior to judgment at some time there was an Article III problem?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2119.081,2126.494,"Well, I think we have to go back to the statute itself which specifically states that if there's no subject matter jurisdiction prior to judgment, the case shall be remanded."
1996.95-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2197.501,2216.725,"Mr. Stayton, would you agree that if the 1-year period had not run and therefore you would presume... by the time there was complete diversity and you would, therefore, presume that the defendant would have made a new removal motion within the 1-year period, that then the error would be harmless?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2216.725,2220.505,Saying if diversity had existed prior to the 1-year limitation?
1996.95-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.505,2220.735,Yes.
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2220.735,2222.277,"Yes, in that case clearly there would have been--"
1996.95-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.277,2228.953,"So, the 1-year problem in the case really goes to the harmless error argument."
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2228.953,2232.045,"--To a large extent, Your Honor, yes."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.045,2235.315,You then disagree with the court of appeals' reasoning.
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2235.315,2236.878,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2236.878,2244.382,I take it then you don't agree or support the reasoning used by the court of appeals to decide this case in your favor.
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2244.382,2245.002,"Well, no."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.272,2260.812,"So, you do agree with the court of appeals reasoning?"
1996.95-1263,1,35164,leonard_j_stayton,,2260.812,2267.308,"Yes, I agree that they were correct in finding that the case should have been remanded due to the fact that there was no subject matter jurisdiction at time of removal."
1996.95-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.43,2351.151,"Thank you, Mr. Stayton."
1996.95-1263,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2353.554,2356.905,"Just two short things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.885,2463.016,"Very well, Mr. Geller."
