2013.12-462,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-462, Northwest, Incorporated v. Rabbi Ginsberg."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,10.222,13.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,85.087,104.983,"Mr. Clement, the argument was made that if -- if the airline has an unreviewable right to terminate this agreement for any reason or for no reason, if that is so, then it's an illusory contract."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,115.772,118.207,"Well, there are a couple of answers to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,140.74,141.923,Did a unitary contract?
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,141.923,142.757,--I'm sorry.
2013.12-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,142.757,144.191,I'm not sure I understand that point.
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,144.191,150.678,"There -- there is a distinction, if you go back to the Horne books on contract law between a unilateral contract and a bilateral contract."
2013.12-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,171.026,182.984,"I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Clement, because I always thought that the way these agreements worked were there were agreements that if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was going to get a free ticket."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,193.707,197.076,"Well, I -- I suppose you could conceive of it that way."
2013.12-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.397,204.847,No.
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,231.714,233.099,I don't think there really is.
2013.12-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,240.336,241.688,I just don't see why that would make sense.
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,256.865,263.519,"That really, I think, gets to the nub of this, because, of course, what you're suggesting is that there would be a market solution to this problem."
2013.12-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,281.98,290.169,"But usually what we say when a contract has no consideration, we don't say, oh, we're going to hold you to it anyway because the market will solve it."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,311.515,319.271,"There -- there is consideration -- I'm not sure anything turns on this -- but there is consideration because this is not something where the airline says, look, we can do anything we want."
2013.12-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.915,338.083,You're not trying to enforce the contract anyway.
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,345.104,347.006,"Well, that is true."
2013.12-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,358.23,359.48,"Mr. Clement, you're making -- you're making an assumption."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,406.894,409.496,"Well, a couple of points, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-462,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,462.731,466.452,"Even if you have absolute discretion, isn't there a limit to that?"
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,476.99,481.794,"The way I would think about it, Justice Sotomayor, is ‶ absolute ″ might not quite mean absolute."
2013.12-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.321,502.041,"Is that entirely -- I mean, suppose the contract said"
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,512.563,514.515,"It might well, Justice Scalia, because--"
2013.12-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.515,516.717,"Well, it might well or it would?"
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,516.717,517.967,--It depends on the State.
2013.12-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.669,520.369,"Well, this State."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,521.736,522.386,"--Okay, Minnesota."
2013.12-462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.539,555.759,Is the choice we have here only between State law and no relief?
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,588.814,589.531,Yes.
2013.12-462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,630.308,640.179,"Well, but -- in part of that suit, wouldn't you have to -- the judge says, what's the underlying substance and you say, well, there's a duty of good faith dealing under Minnesota law."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,646.519,648.035,"No, I don't think there's Federal common law."
2013.12-462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.879,668.699,I still don't understand the substantive basis for the breach of contract suit if you say we can't refer to State law.
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,668.699,672.151,--You can refer to State law for the breach of contract.
2013.12-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,677.638,681.573,"Well, Mr. Clement, suppose that this complaint only had one count."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,716.979,721.817,I think the reliance on the implied covenant in that context should be preempted.
2013.12-462,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,750.42,755.221,"I guess what I'm suggesting is that the implied covenant here, it's just an interpretive tool."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,772.85,783.991,"Well, here's my thought on that, which is I think even the Respondents admit that in some States the implied covenant is much more than simply a rule of construction for the explicit terms of the contract."
2013.12-462,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,817.129,825.135,"Counsel, could you tell me where you think they concede that some States -- that their position would lead to a different result in some States?"
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,825.135,829.27,"Well, I'm not -- it's -- it's in the red brief and I think it's quite clear."
2013.12-462,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,844.062,852.385,"I thought they were saying that in some States it's not an implied term of the contract, but a different sort of provision."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,852.385,854.154,"Well, I may have misspoke."
2013.12-462,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,867.145,869.247,How about Minnesota?
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,873.116,874.751,"We don't believe so, Your Honor."
2013.12-462,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,896.414,897.214,Is it the case that--
2013.12-462,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.214,898.099,I still -- I still have this problem.
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,913.776,916.728,"I may have misspoke, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-462,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.958,974.766,"Well, I suppose you could say that it is assumed that parties to a contract comport with community standards of fairness and decency."
2013.12-462,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,978.468,979.685,You could try to wiggle there.
2013.12-462,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1005.885,1007.32,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1015.324,1018.462,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1048.497,1063.907,"What if you had a decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court on common law contract principles and it said, you know, when the parties use the word ‶ sole ″ in a contract, we interpret that to mean subject to reasonableness constraint."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1070.645,1072.597,"In that context, I think not."
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1082.017,1084.635,"Well, ‶ reasonable ″ means -- I mean, you know, the -- the airline says ‶ sole ″ means sole."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1093.741,1096.443,"--Yes, I understand, Chief Justice, thank you."
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.769,1111.219,"Well, let's say going forward."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1123.612,1140.122,"--I think subsequent, if there is a gloss where -- and the -- I think that would be a question of what the parties intended with the contract, and I think there may well be an argument under that scenario that the airline understood that the gloss was going to be given, although I--"
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1140.122,1150.346,"We would assume then that the parties knew whenever they used the word ‶ sole ″, they actually meant subject to reasonableness as interpreted by the Minnesota Supreme Court."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1150.346,1152.063,"--I think that may well be right, Your Honor."
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1178.997,1180.949,So you're not going to give me ‶ reasonable ″ for anything?
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1180.949,1181.882,"No, no."
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1183.667,1184.151,Okay.
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1184.151,1184.801,I think it just--
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1184.801,1215.872,"Well, if you're going to give me ‶ reasonable ″ -- in other words, the parties' express terms do not say ‶ reasonable ″; in fact, the most natural reading is that it's not reasonable, but they take the contractual -- the interpretation that the Minnesota Supreme Court has adopted, I don't know why the same rule wouldn't apply when the Minnesota Supreme Court says there is an implied condition of reasonableness across -- across the board, and that the parties contract against that background just like they do when there's a specific interpretation of the word ‶ sole ″."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1215.872,1228.18,"--I think the problem, Chief Justice, is that the notion of the doctrine of the implied covenant is extraordinarily broad and encompasses a number of different concepts."
2013.12-462,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1245.574,1247.541,Let me change the hypothetical slightly.
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1271.157,1277.196,I think the ADA would preempt exactly that sort of claim or a claim based on that sort of an argument.
2013.12-462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1299.609,1299.992,That's right.
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1348.959,1353.244,"--Justice Breyer, I heartily endorse each of the four criteria you identified."
2013.12-462,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1353.244,1353.727,"Well, good."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1356.563,1373.157,And I think the standard that this Court could adopt and make very clear is that any contract doctrine which seeks to interpret the intent of the parties at the time of the contract's formation is a valid standard to be applied in any suit and is not preempted by the ADA.
2013.12-462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1386.5,1388.184,You said ‶ in some States ″.
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1401.527,1403.86,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think there's a continuum."
2013.12-462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1437.933,1438.767,Suppose the State--
2013.12-462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.767,1440.469,I don't want to have to sort those out State by State.
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1489.082,1494.786,"Justice Scalia, I have two responses to that observation."
2013.12-462,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.117,1536.613,"There are variances, but not variances in such an ineffable question as to whether this is really an effort to discern the real intent of the parties or rather, whether it's an intent to impose community standards, especially since, as I say, parties intend to adopt community standards usually."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1536.613,1540.084,"With respect, Justice Scalia, I think that's not at all a difficult question."
2013.12-462,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1560.396,1561.698,Could I give you -- I'm quoting the Minnesota--
2013.12-462,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1561.698,1564.05,"Well, it's easy for you, representing the government."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1575.507,1580.375,"--I -- I have one principal response, Justice Kennedy, which is this."
2013.12-462,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1597.854,1598.537,--If we had--
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1598.537,1608.395,"I do agree, it seems pretty inconsistent with the normal presumption against preemption that we apply out of respect for the State legal regimes to say we're going to adopt a broad prophylactic rule."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1608.395,1615.298,"This -- this is, in part, precisely why we propose that the Court look -- adopt a standard, which we don't think would be particularly--"
2013.12-462,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1615.298,1616.834,--So let's go back to a simpler standard.
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1616.834,1618.734,You -- go ahead.
2013.12-462,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1618.734,1626.44,My simpler standard comes from quoting Hennepin:
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1642.633,1644.568,--That is an okay statement.
2013.12-462,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1645.168,1649.639,"So if that's what Minnesota law says, it's okay and it's not preempted."
2013.12-462,1,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,1649.639,1653.09,"--With the following caveat, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-462,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1663.379,1664.065,Thank you.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1667.117,1678.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1712.194,1714.496,What was the lack of good faith that you are claiming?
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1721.152,1727.139,--The action was terminating him from the program and taking away his miles--
2013.12-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1727.139,1727.622,Can't be that--
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1727.622,1728.806,--without possible cause.
2013.12-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1728.806,1732.174,--because there has to be -- what are you saying was the bad cause here?
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1737.077,1740.463,"Well, we do not think that he was abusing the program."
2013.12-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1740.463,1740.913,That's--
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1740.913,1742.648,The allegations in the complaint are that--
2013.12-462,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1742.648,1744.715,--So you are doing exactly what he is saying.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1749.052,1770.383,"--We think that there is some -- there are some reasons that he could not be terminated from the program for, and there are allegations in the complaint, that are incorporated into the covenant of good faith claim in the complaint, that he was terminated because of the merger between Delta and Northwest."
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1770.383,1794.181,As I understand your argument -- correct me if I am wrong -- he could be terminated without reasonable cause if he happened to be from a State or if the suit was brought under the governing law of a State which imposed this obligation of good faith as a matter of law.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1813.327,1817.963,I don't think so.
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.315,1829.087,"He would have no cause of action, because this is obviously not an interpretation of the contract; it is an imposition of a State requirement."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1829.087,1833.758,"--We agree that if it's not construing the contract, that if a State--"
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.758,1834.175,Okay.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1834.591,1840.229,"--were instead claiming that the contract violated the law, instead of that Northwest had violated the contract--"
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.229,1843.764,"--Wow, somebody's really been given a raw deal."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1851.62,1863.81,"--Well, States tend, in applying the covenant of good faith, to apply it in -- as a contract interpretation tool, as a way of giving effect to the benefits of the bargain."
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.81,1864.96,"Some do, some don't."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1864.96,1876.418,"The vast majority of States, and there is an appendix to the States' brief on this issue, talk about the covenant of good faith as a way of interpreting the contract, and Minnesota--"
2013.12-462,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1876.418,1876.835,"Well, let me ask you this."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1910.075,1914.277,"--Generally, the covenant of good faith cannot be waived."
2013.12-462,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1925.751,1932.922,"But if it can't be waived, it sure seems as though it is operating independently of the parties' reasonable expectations."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1932.922,1950.533,"--Again, I think you need to separate out the principle that it can't be waived from the underlying principle of what the covenant is doing, which is giving effect to the bargain that the parties entered into based on looking at the reasonable expression -- the reasonable expectations of the parties."
2013.12-462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.533,1963.96,In Wolens -- and this is a case that you rely on and that allowed room for contract claims -- the expression was ‶ self-imposed undertaking ″.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1988.925,2002.001,"Well, the terms of the contract are the self-imposed undertaking, and then this is the tool that's being used to understand and interpret the tools of the -- terms of the contract and then to enforce them."
2013.12-462,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2044.512,2054.018,"Well, how do you account for the fact that in many States the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is read into most contracts, but is not read into employment contracts?"
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2054.018,2066.943,I think that that's a situation that States struggle with given the at-will employment doctrine and they've viewed the covenant and the at-will employment doctrine as being in conflict with each other.
2013.12-462,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2083.87,2091.309,"Well, doesn't that discrepancy show simply that the State has different policies with respect to those two types of contracts?"
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2091.309,2097.63,I -- I don't think that it's applying different types of policy.
2013.12-462,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2103.2,2124.447,"I mean, it might be, right, because people have different expectations in those two different situations, and that the at-will employment is so pervasive and so customary and so sweeping that the policy, the rule of an implied covenant of good faith doesn't apply there because we think everybody expects it not to apply there."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2124.447,2125.197,Exactly.
2013.12-462,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2138.04,2145.693,An at-will employment contract is a contract that gives the employer sole discretion as to whether to retain an employee.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2155.851,2173.213,"--Well, it's a difference in the context and what the term ‶ sole discretion ″ means in different contexts is going to vary based on the context, and based on what someone entering into that contract reasonably would have expected that contract to mean based on the terms of the contract."
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.02,2189.989,"Well, you would agree -- it's the same question I asked the government; I would like your answer."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2226.347,2227.281,We agree that that does not--
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.281,2227.697,All right.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2238.572,2243.726,--I think our standard is very similar to the one that the United States said.
2013.12-462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2272.71,2278.047,Suppose the supreme court of the State had an opinion that said we're going to be candid about this.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2317.524,2318.824,Yes.
2013.12-462,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2333.534,2348.71,"That would be weird, isn't it, because in such a State, there might be a contract where the parties reasonably did expect this implicit term that limits something, a very broad conferral of discretion to operate."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2356.666,2372.076,"--I think it would depend on how the claim was framed and how the court interpreted that claim and whether in interpreting that claim, the court was looking at the reasonable expectations of the parties based on the terms of the contract and based on their desire to be bound by an enforceable contract."
2013.12-462,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2378.48,2388.537,"And that's no clearer than the -- the government's view, and it seems to me to be a particular problem when you're talking about the objectives of the ADA to say that the rule varies from State to State."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2401.611,2406.415,I don't think that -- that the rule itself is varying from State to State.
2013.12-462,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2409.801,2410.117,Yes.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2417.89,2430.797,"--I don't think that it necessarily would because in all the States, a claim that's seeking to get at the expectations and intents of the parties would not be preempted where as one imposing external notions of fairness would."
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.797,2440.653,"That isn't what your -- your complaint that I think -- paragraph 56, which I think is the key paragraph says, that the -- under the -- the law is,"
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2493.221,2498.525,"Well, I think there's a difference between expectations, subjective expectations and reasonable expectations."
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.624,2533.682,"Ms. Rosenbaum, in -- in our decision in this case, do you think we should apply the presumption against preemption of State law?"
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2533.682,2539.086,I think you should apply the presumption against preemption of State law because it does apply.
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.086,2541.419,But the whole purpose of the ADA was to preempt State laws.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2565.403,2566.869,I do think the presumption applies.
2013.12-462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2581.329,2583.365,"Well, it's one thing to read the terms in the agreement."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2611.782,2648.973,"I think there is a fair amount of uniformity across the States in how they actually apply the covenant of good faith, and in terms of applying it as an interpretation of the contract, and then especially in cases where one party is claiming that all of their performance under the contract is in their sole discretion and that they're free not to perform under the contract at all, you know, essentially where the contract would be illusory in applying the covenant specifically under those circumstances to ensure that there is meaningful performance that's required under the contract."
2013.12-462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2648.973,2652.092,Is an employment at-will contract illusory?
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2652.092,2656.913,I don't believe that's an illusory contract.
2013.12-462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.74,2702.525,That's because the contract was silent.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2717.951,2725.24,"Well, in Wolens, the question was an express reservation of rights and the contract didn't say whether or not it applied retroactively."
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.609,2737.365,Would this contract produce a different result if it did not contain the words ‶ in its sole discretion ″?
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2737.365,2745.637,"The interpretation of the contract might be different, but the reasonable expectations--"
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.637,2749.339,"Well, you'd -- you'd -- you'd still apply the very same doctrine of reasonableness, right?"
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2754.492,2767.3,--I think there may be a larger amount of deference that's given to the airline in that a party would reasonably expect would be given to the airline because of the sole discretion language.
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.454,2773.854,Yes.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2776.072,2787.13,I think question is less State-by-State and really more case-by-case and context-by-context of what does sole discretion language mean when used -- and where do you apply limitations on it.
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.13,2801.121,"I find it hard to believe that you're doing nothing but interpreting a contract when you -- you give it the same outcome, whether it says in its sole discretion or does not say in its sole discretion."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2808.793,2819.435,"I don't think that there would necessarily be the same outcome in every single situation, whether or not the claim -- whether or not the contract said ‶ sole discretion ″ or not."
2013.12-462,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2863.111,2867.082,May I ask you a question about something slightly different?
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2889.545,2905.457,"We think that that's another reason why this claim is not preempted, is because it has to do with membership in a frequent flyer program, rather than being -- rather than, like in Wolens, having to do specifically with access to flights or--"
2013.12-462,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2905.457,2909.909,What are the facts relating to this particular plan?
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2916.562,2930.072,"--There are not very many facts in the record about the plan, but the contract does refer to airline miles -- sorry, to airline partners from whom one could earn miles and then use miles also."
2013.12-462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2930.072,2930.905,The plaintiff--
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2930.905,2932.357,"Delta, which is merged into--"
2013.12-462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2932.357,2943.046,"--And the plaintiff used the frequent flyer program, whatever else it might be used for, he used it to get lower prices on flights, right?"
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2943.046,2945.165,"--He did, yes."
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.334,2950.652,Why does -- it relates to prices.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,2987.009,3001.934,"--This is a claim just about his membership in the program overall, and that is a membership where people who have the same claim as him could be earning miles on their credit card, spending miles on hotel rooms."
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.844,3016.144,I'm sorry.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3021.348,3023.95,"--No, I'm saying that someone--"
2013.12-462,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.95,3027.569,"The person who gets the discount for the hotel room is the person who bought the airline ticket, right?"
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3027.569,3033.056,--Or the person who used their credit card to receive frequent flyer miles.
2013.12-462,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3033.056,3040.543,Your point is that you can get frequent flyer miles by purchases other than airplane transportation.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3040.543,3041.161,Yes.
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.719,3056.505,I didn't see anything in the complaint about anything other than airlines.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3056.505,3058.957,"--He, himself--"
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.957,3064.342,Is there anything in your complaint that talks about anything other than airlines?
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3064.342,3065.444,"--No, there isn't."
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3069.896,3070.379,"No, I know."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3085.957,3087.19,"--Well, his claim--"
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.19,3092.928,"Well, if there is something else in this complaint, tell me and I will have to figure out whether we go beyond the complaint."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3092.928,3096.396,--His claim is about his membership in the program itself.
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3106.271,3107.471,Does it say that in the complaint?
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3107.471,3108.471,No.
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3108.471,3108.771,No.
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3108.771,3113.942,"It does not specifically say, but the contract does refer to the airline partners and this was decided--"
2013.12-462,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.942,3116.043,"And an airline partner, I take it, is another airline?"
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3116.043,3124.149,"--No, I think airline partners can be the people with whom they partner with, to whom they sell their miles."

2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3204.017,3214.473,"--Well, there are separate regulations that apply to safety under the ADA, so -- and separate preemption doctrines that apply to safety under the ADA."
2013.12-462,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3358.268,3373.127,"I don't think it helps your argument to say that your position promotes the purposes of the ADA, because the whole point of that, of the preemption provision, is that's for the Federal government to determine, not for different state laws, what promotes the purposes of the ADA."
2013.12-462,2,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3373.127,3381.05,"Well, one thing this Court said in Wolens was that having -- being able -- for people to be able to trust their contracts was something that promoted the purposes of the ADA."
