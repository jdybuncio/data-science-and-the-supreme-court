1976.75-1197,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1501.68,1515.905,"Mr. Brusman, in order to prevail on your argument, as I understand your position, you have to first pick out a purpose that to identify that Congress was shooting at and then in effect conclude that it missed."
1976.75-1197,1,35516,marvin_a_brusman,,1517.726,1541.13,"Well, the standard for testing the constitutionality of congressional legislation, as I understand it, is that the classification drawn by Congress has to bear a relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose and I think it is important to identify that purpose and to see whether the classification drawn relates to it."
1976.75-1197,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1541.13,1554.583,"But in identifying the purpose, you necessarily have to take the position that Congress had a purpose in mind but some of them misfired, somewhere between adopting that purpose and getting a law passed."

1976.75-1197,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.822,1612.501,"But do you say we must conclude that each time Congress amended the act, it had the same purpose in mind?"
1976.75-1197,1,35516,marvin_a_brusman,,1612.501,1615.321,"Well, that purpose had not changed."
1976.75-1197,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2670.122,2674.642,"If I may just very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
