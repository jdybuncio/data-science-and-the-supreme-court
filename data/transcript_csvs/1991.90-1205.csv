1991.90-1205,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.25,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1205, United States against Ray Mabus, No. 90-6588 Jake Ayers v. Mabus."
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,15.01,19.134,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.90-1205,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.037,291.811,So you think the Court should resolve the Title VI claim before it gets to the constitutional claim?
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,291.811,292.792,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1205,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.008,307.503,"Is the test under title VI any different than it would be under the constitutional claim, do you think?"
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,307.503,309.633,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1991.90-1205,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.231,336.741,Let me pursue this just--
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,336.741,337.262,--Yes.
1991.90-1205,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,337.262,338.563,--one minute with you.
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,348.629,349.881,"I think so, Your Honor."
1991.90-1205,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.16,356.076,And are the remedies any different under title VI than they would be under the constitutional claim?
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,356.076,357.595,I--
1991.90-1205,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.595,359.716,Is there any different standard employed?
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,359.716,360.126,--Yes.
1991.90-1205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,437.577,441.832,"Mr. Chambliss, I'm interested in Justice O'Connor's question."
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,450.977,452.366,I--
1991.90-1205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,452.366,453.328,I take it you don't?
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,453.328,456.11,"--Well, Your Honor, let me just say it like this."
1991.90-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.619,601.128,"Mr. Chambliss, I'm interested in what specific remedies you propose, and my quandary in particular is this: do you want remedies that have the effect of providing or leading to de facto integration, so that the historically black universities won't be overwhelmingly black and the historically white will not be overwhelmingly white?"
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,602.979,603.419,"No, sir."
1991.90-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.921,631.296,"Because I mean, if you're looking for that, you would adopt a quite different remedy than, for example, strengthening the curriculums in the historically black schools from the... if the de facto segregation that now exists is largely... is largely the result of personal preference--"
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,631.296,632.197,--No... no sir.
1991.90-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.197,645.027,--the worst thing to do would be to establish a black university that is... has the full curriculum and is fully as good as what is now the predominantly white university.
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,653.502,654.411,"No, sir."
1991.90-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.411,657.165,--You want us to destroy that system and adopt policies that will--
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,657.165,658.395,"Just... oh, I'm sorry."
1991.90-1205,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.947,661.246,--Tell me... tell me what you want.
1991.90-1205,0,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,661.246,666.378,"Justice, I think that's a good question; it's a very fair question, but I think we have an adequate answer."
1991.90-1205,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.899,726.401,"Very good, Mr. Chambliss."
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,728.17,735.787,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.051,779.716,"The test is applied to everybody, blacks and whites, isn't it, General Starr?"
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,779.716,780.885,"--Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.885,782.858,You are talking about a discriminatory impact?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,782.858,795.686,I am talking about a discriminatory effect in view of this test having first been imposed in the wake of James Meredith's attempt to enter Old Miss.
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,837.064,841.819,"You want... whatever test you are proposing, you would want to apply to all the universities?"
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,841.819,842.47,--Of course.
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.171,847.913,Now there is a lower standard to get into the so-called black university?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,847.913,849.383,"--That is correct, there is a lower standard--"
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.383,849.834,And a higher standard--
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,849.834,850.675,--That is correct--
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.675,852.375,--And you would lower the standards for all?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,852.375,856.709,"--At the remedy stage, that is certainly one realistic possibility."
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.309,859.25,What do you propose?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,859.25,865.844,--What I am proposing is that they take grades and other aspects of that student's background into account.
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.844,867.935,"Right across the board, at all universities?"
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,867.935,868.876,Absolutely.
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.191,897.005,"Were there any district court findings on these issues, General Starr?"
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,897.005,897.836,"Yes, there were."
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.58,908.09,Are you challenging that finding?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,908.09,909.793,"--I am, but more than that--"
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,909.793,911.583,Because it is clearly erroneous?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,911.583,915.456,"--Yes, but I have a threshold problem with what the district court did, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.1,948.468,I was asking you about what I thought was a factual finding of the district... whether this particular test discriminates or was intended to discriminate at the present time.
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,958.423,966.581,"--I think that the finding can stand, but the finding, nonetheless, fails to take into account the standard."
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.973,988.693,You said there was such a finding in this case?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,988.693,990.564,There was such a finding in this case.
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.564,992.386,You are willing to leave that finding as is--
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,992.386,993.488,Correct.
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.488,995.439,--but you are challenging what consequences flow from it?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,995.439,997.78,I am also challenging again... that is one way of putting it.
1991.90-1205,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1023.976,1027.549,"Well, General Starr, let me ask you a little about that."
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1061.9,1076.891,"--Well, we do think that this Court in Bazemore said that where there is not State compulsion, the State make the choice for you and assigns you to a particular school, then the standard is voluntary and unfettered choice."
1991.90-1205,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1081.966,1090.542,Did Bazemore involve a situation where it was determined that the State had caused the discrimination?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1090.542,1091.401,--Yes.
1991.90-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1161.558,1169.984,"Isn't that a way of saying, Mr. Starr, that that means that Bazemore is inapplicable to this context?"
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1169.984,1172.685,--I don't think it's inapplicable.
1991.90-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1174.335,1181.181,I would have thought you would have said that Bazemore involved 4-H clubs which are very easily changed.
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1192.396,1193.568,"--We do say that, exactly, that is our submission."
1991.90-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1196.1,1198.401,Then it seems to me that Bazemore is not of much help.
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1198.401,1204.465,"--Well, it... I don't... argue with the Court about the applicability of its own precedent."
1991.90-1205,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.361,1230.451,Here is the problem.
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1295.594,1298.827,"Two points quickly, 70 percent is not choice."
1991.90-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1354.084,1359.076,How does the installation of programs at those schools increase the black enrollment at Old Miss?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1359.076,1367.862,"It... that may not at Old Miss, but we are trying to desegregate an entire system and dismantle the entire system."
1991.90-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1371.355,1372.744,Then we are right back to Justice Scalia's problem.
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1381.012,1381.671,--No.
1991.90-1205,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1451.628,1455.709,Do you have any problem with the academic standards for matriculation at Old Miss?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1455.709,1458.451,Not the academic standards.
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.806,1514.049,"But you are not insisting on the Green standard, is that it?"
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1514.049,1515.319,That's correct.
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.31,1526.685,You want just to dismantle whatever you identify as the vestiges that fetter choice?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1526.685,1527.457,--Exactly right.
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.099,1530.949,How do you know whether they do or not?
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1539.825,1540.944,There are two very quick ones.
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.615,1595.922,"What if... what would you have done if you hadn't identified and thought that it was proved, these two vestiges that fetter choice?"
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1604.577,1610.341,There is no constitutional impediment to a racially identifiable institution.
1991.90-1205,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.906,1623.339,"So if Mississippi does what you think it ought to do, and there is still black colleges and white colleges--"
1991.90-1205,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1623.339,1624.63,--We have no quarrel.
1991.90-1205,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1627.622,1629.074,"--Thank you, General Starr."
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1631.535,1634.687,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.548,1804.246,May I just ask about those figures?
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1807.689,1809.54,--They're current and they're almost the same.
1991.90-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1809.54,1812.083,"But the ones in the record don't show those figures, do they?"
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1812.083,1813.763,"They're awfully close to that, Your Honor."
1991.90-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.763,1819.878,"Well, I had a figure, the latest figure for the University of Mississippi was 5.9 percent black, in the record."
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1824.479,1825.471,"I'm sure there is, Your Honor."
1991.90-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.205,1835.797,"Well, how are we going to verify that today's figures, to be sure they're right?"
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1835.797,1838.601,We'll verify them however we need to.
1991.90-1205,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.601,1844.164,You criticize your opponent for trying to retry the case and now you're giving us facts that I understand are not part of the record.
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1844.164,1845.824,"Well, I apologize for that."
1991.90-1205,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.824,1847.874,What does the record show?
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1847.874,1859.304,The record shows that at the time of the trial there was as many black students in the five predominantly white schools as there are in Alcorn State University and Mississippi State University combined.
1991.90-1205,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.203,2017.486,"What do you mean by the term ""underfunding"", ""underfunded""?"
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2017.486,2019.167,"That's a good question, sir."
1991.90-1205,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2027.672,2030.954,You just used the term in argument a moment ago.
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2033.358,2045.685,"--When I think that all of our institutions are underfunded because they don't get enough to do the job we would like for them to do, the ones most underfunded are the three predominantly white--"
1991.90-1205,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.685,2049.266,"You still haven't told me what you mean by the word ""underfunded""."
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2049.266,2058.443,--Insufficient money in the eyes of educators to adequately do the best job with the programs you have for the students.
1991.90-1205,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.443,2063.656,So it's kind of... not being underfunded would be kind of an educational ideal?
1991.90-1205,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,2063.656,2064.097,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1205,3,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,3386.331,3398.24,"Your Honor, the facilities talk about as the grand jury condemned, Mississippi Valley State has two buildings... and it's in my record... that just stand... look so good from the highway."
1991.90-1205,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3544.233,3546.076,"Thank you, Mr. Chambliss."
1991.90-1205,3,15763,alvin_o_chambliss_jr,,3546.076,3546.476,Thank you.
1991.90-1205,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3546.476,3548.149,The case is submitted.
