2000.99-2071,0,35713,martha_f_davis,,9.223,12.181,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-2071,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,72.511,76.671,"Miss Davis, is this an as-applied or a facial challenge?"
2000.99-2071,0,35713,martha_f_davis,,76.671,79.056,"Justice O'Connor, this is a facial challenge."
2000.99-2071,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,85.709,85.709,How do you deal with the Fiallo case?
2000.99-2071,0,35713,martha_f_davis,,85.709,104.589,"Your Honor, the Fiallo case concerns the situation of some individuals who are citizens applying for special immigration preferences for children of those citizens or relatives of those citizens."
2000.99-2071,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1647.386,1669.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the naturalization clause of the United States Constitution commits to Congress the plenary power inherent in the sovereignty of every nation to determine which aliens will be granted United States citizenship."
2000.99-2071,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1680.26,1695.538,"Well, you've heard all these arguments this morning that this isn't a case of naturalization and not part of Congress' plenary power when a child is born of a parent that's a U.S. citizen."
2000.99-2071,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1695.538,1702.297,"With respect to that, I think this Court's decision in Wong Kim Ark is dispositive."
2000.99-2071,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1733.715,1735.491,That's not so.
2000.99-2071,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1770.791,1772.315,"--Yes, I'm not disputing that."
2000.99-2071,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1800.605,1816.23,"So, in other words, in your view, the hundreds of millions of people by now who may have been born abroad of American parents are suddenly subject, when their constitutional rights are at stake, to a less basic review by the courts than citizens who are born in the United States?"
2000.99-2071,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1816.23,1816.685,"No, once--"
2000.99-2071,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1816.685,1816.23,"Citizens of service people, citizens of millions of people who have lived abroad?"
2000.99-2071,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1816.23,1830.143,"--Once the person is a citizen, of course, then that citizen, like every other citizen, is entitled to all the rights of a citizen under the United States Constitution."

2000.99-2071,2,35713,martha_f_davis,,3489.212,3489.951,--I'm sorry?
2000.99-2071,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3489.951,3493.17,Do you think Lehr against Robertson was correctly decided?
2000.99-2071,2,35713,martha_f_davis,,3493.17,3499.109,"Your Honor, I think it can be distinguished from this case, aside from my view of its propriety."
2000.99-2071,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3524.736,3525.315,Is there a problem for the child in Lehr?
