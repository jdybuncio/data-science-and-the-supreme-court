2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.266,We will now hear argument in Ashcroft against Raich.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,6.623,9.771,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,36.136,58.841,"Well, Mr. Clement, the... I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,58.841,77.105,"Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases."
2004.03-1454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,80.556,89.682,"Well, but in Wickard, of course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his wheat did, in part, go in the national market."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,116.648,128.53,"Well, Justice O'Connor, let me first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with California law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana."
2004.03-1454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.357,148.385,"Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law?"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,155.339,167.877,"Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any reason to assume that California is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate."
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,187.935,199.258,"Well, General Clement, what if we were to assume... I'm not saying this is... that the District Court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had... say they made such findings."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,202.125,205.315,"I think you would say they were relevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because--"
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,205.315,208.756,But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,208.756,216.171,"--Well, because I think it is a reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question... I think that in... obviously, in all of these commerce--"
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,216.171,218.928,"Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,218.928,252.476,"--Well, in your hypothetical... and if I could turn to that... I still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect."
2004.03-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.713,267.922,But it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,294.572,297.248,"Well, no, it doesn't, Justice Scalia, but let me respond in two ways."
2004.03-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.142,311.873,Absolutely.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,311.873,324.747,"And I would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes."
2004.03-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.747,327.317,But that's quite a different rational than Wickard v. Filburn.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,347.906,351.409,"Well, I think there's some truth to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this."
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,358.929,371.007,But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory... you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject... substances from being sold or... in interstate commerce.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,384.79,395.208,"--Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I substances."
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,404.885,414.008,"But to the extent that this statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the interstate market and confine these to locally grown marijuana."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,414.008,418.231,"--Well, first of all, Justice Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, to get back to--"
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.231,423.934,Then I'm assuming... my hypothetical is that California could pass a law that would prevent diversions from occurring.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,423.934,434.253,"--Well, in the same way that the Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion."
2004.03-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.808,439.329,"I suppose some... one answer to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,439.329,441.769,"Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy."
2004.03-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.614,468.383,"But, as Justice O'Connor brought out earlier, all those cases... Wickard, Perez... they all involved a commercial enterprise."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,475.526,489.085,"--Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce to activity that the Court described as economic, but not commercial."
2004.03-1454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,498.002,517.828,"But you're... no, I was going to... your whole point, I take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply... simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, growing it themselves or being given it."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,524.449,533.402,"That's exactly right, Justice Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz and Perez."
2004.03-1454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,541.921,543.349,"Well, I do take issue with that."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,560.854,577.798,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, it could be... I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts, of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was... it was only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm."
2004.03-1454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.242,582.099,The other portion is a matter of xxx interstate commerce.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,582.099,593.825,"--Well, that's true, Justice O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion, Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside... to one side all of the grain that was going to go in interstate commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents."
2004.03-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,652.054,652.465,And is--
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,652.465,652.681,--authority.
2004.03-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,652.681,665.958,"--this a harder or easier case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to buy and sell marijuana?"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,665.958,666.963,"Well, Justice Kennedy--"
2004.03-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.963,669.1,"Does this make your case easier, in a sense, or--"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,669.1,692.11,"--I think it does, Justice Kennedy, because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit something in interstate commerce entirely, and has exercised that power, so it treats something as effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then takes the complementary step, especially in light of the fungibility of the product, and says,"
2004.03-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,752.278,752.66,But there's--
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,752.66,752.905,--Marinol.
2004.03-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,752.905,763.942,"--but there is, in this record, a showing that, for at least one of the two plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of them worked."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,795.197,821.997,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we would take the position, based on our reading of the Oakland cannabis case... and, obviously, different justices on this Court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical-necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion... I would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of Oakland cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available."
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.665,897.03,"--Well, I think--"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,897.03,897.549,--those states that made it lawful.
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.549,900.336,"--Doesn't it depend on how you define the ""relevant class of activities""?"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,919.055,921.706,"Well, I don't think that is permissible, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.651,928.603,So you're saying that this statute could never have an unconstitutional application.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,928.603,933.29,"--Under the Commerce Clause, I... that's exactly right, that would be our position."
2004.03-1454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,948.835,964.561,"But, in Morrison, did the Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify Commerce Cause... Clause legislation by using a long but-for causal chain from the activity in question to an impact on interstate commerce?"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,966.911,968.998,"--Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor, but--"
2004.03-1454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,968.998,970.506,Which cuts against what you're saying.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,970.506,972.401,"--Well, with respect, I don't think so."
2004.03-1454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1002.584,1013.856,"The argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use... growing for personal use, under prescription--"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1013.856,1025.089,"I understand that... I understand that's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't understand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that Wickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is not also covered."
2004.03-1454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.395,1027.853,Involved economic activity.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1027.853,1028.816,--I'm sorry if I misspoke.
2004.03-1454,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.201,1047.394,"--If we rule for the Respondents in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana would go up or down in California?"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1047.394,1052.389,"I would be speculating, Justice Kennedy, but I think the price would go down."
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.591,1138.603,"In other words, the statute is... it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1138.603,1151.954,"Well, I think, in responding to that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government treats it as a Schedule I substance."
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.371,1167.593,Right.
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1167.593,1169.988,I think that's the import of the Rutherford decision with Laetrile.
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.988,1179.1,Do you think there could be any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no acceptable medical use?
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1188.459,1191.797,"Well, it depends on the exact hypothetical you have in mind."
2004.03-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1264.738,1265.275,Have there--
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1265.275,1266.161,--available to patients--
2004.03-1454,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.161,1271.44,--have there been any applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the FDA?
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1271.44,1274.331,--There have been a number of those petitions that have been filed.
2004.03-1454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1422.361,1428.169,"May I go back to your point a few minutes ago about... it was, sort of, a categoric point... you, in effect, said,"
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1497.719,1507.154,"With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress' judgement about defining a class of activities--"
2004.03-1454,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1507.154,1520.932,"That may... oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're... you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage."
2004.03-1454,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1538.985,1542.856,"--Well, Justice Souter, I have no doubt that this Court could draw a line."
2004.03-1454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.143,1561.343,Mr. Barnett?
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1561.343,1568.543,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1606.863,1625.438,"Well, on your first point, can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that simple possession of that commodity is a form of participation in the market?"
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1625.438,1628.03,"It can be, or it might not be."
2004.03-1454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1643.936,1644.807,"Well, but it's fungible."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1644.807,1658.086,"--That... the fungibility issue is in this case, but the... but a... the fact that a good is fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not make the possession of that good an economic activity."
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.582,1663.102,"Well, you know, Congress has applied this theory in other contexts."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1700.173,1706.272,"--Not if they're an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut, unless those activities are reached."
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.272,1708.691,"Well, why is that different from this?"
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1708.691,1718.311,"Because this class of activities... because it's been isolated by the State of California, and is policed by the State of California, so that it's entirely separated from the market--"
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1718.311,1728.561,Isolated and... I understand that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the medical use of all of the members of the communes.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1728.561,1730.949,--That class of activities is not before the Court.
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.134,1740.666,"No, but it's before the Court when you... when you raise the policing of the problem by California, and saying it's not a... it's not a real problem, you brought it before the Court."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1740.666,1747.151,"--But that class of activities could be... could be... if this Court limits its ruling to the class of activities that is before the Court, that class--"
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.151,1747.912,Which is... which is what?
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1747.912,1748.323,--Which is--
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.323,1749.892,An individual grower?
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1749.892,1755.422,"--An individual who is growing it for her... him or herself, who has... or has a caregiver growing it for her--"
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.422,1756.337,"Gee, what basis--"
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1756.337,1756.517,--for--
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.517,1758.797,"--what basis is there to draw it that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we... we could say people whose last name begins with a Z."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1770.126,1782.722,"--Justice Scalia, we believe it makes sense because we are talking about a classification of activities that has been identified by the State of California, and which is rational to distinguish from--"
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.722,1786.381,"Oh, but California hasn't identified individual growers."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1789.472,1794.498,"--Well, it's not entirely clear whether communes are okay, as far as the California laws are concerned."
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.498,1794.858,Why wouldn't it be?
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1794.858,1798.523,"Because if, in fact, commercial activity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking place--"
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.523,1799.543,"No, no, they're not buying and selling."
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.244,1809.909,"I mean, I don't understand. Is there any authority in the commerce cases for... an X, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other... now, Congress' power does extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about the X."

2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.67,1905.962,Yeah.

2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,1966.785,1969.614,"--Well, you've raised at least two different practical issues."

2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2023.868,2024.297,Of course not.
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2024.297,2025.164,--in the illicit drug market.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2025.493,2025.937,Of course not.
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.937,2027.589,"And we don't want low prices, either."

2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2046.613,2047.182,--Well--

I do want to make sure that I focus on this... the threshold issue, which is the issue that has occupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity here is economic or non-economic."

2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2289.139,2289.935,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2289.935,2290.294,All right.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2291.435,2303.113,"But a limiting principle is the one that I... was identified by the Court in Lopez in which the government is asserting that if it's an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached."
2004.03-1454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2325.217,2329.554,"--Yeah, but it doesn't right now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your view."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2329.554,2342.019,"Well, because... but this is the sort of regulation... the sort of effectiveness of the regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact... I believe the Court should be in the position of trusting the State of California to be able to administer its regime."
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2361.958,2365.209,"So this is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2372.565,2373.07,--Well--
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.07,2379.163,Because it's essential to regulate guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory scheme.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2379.163,2384.042,"--Justice Breyer, that's the reason why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it doesn't reach your result."
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.054,2425.576,"Well, I thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what I had to... what I had to say in Lopez to... was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2435.131,2438.166,But this case is completely unlike those cases.
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.517,2460.697,"Well, we didn't decide that, in Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in interstate commerce."

2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.66,2498.18,Sounds like Wickard to me.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2498.18,2499.834,"Well, Wickard, Your Honor--"
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.834,2503.246,"I always used to laugh at Wickard, but that's... that's what Wickard said."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2503.246,2504.637,--Wickard--
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.637,2508.136,"Had he not eaten the wheat, it would have been in interstate commerce."

2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.703,2516.746,"Well, that's what it was about, as far as the Court's analysis was concerned."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2538.203,2548.466,It's... the entire analysis... the entire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was proof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the farms.
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.521,2560.205,"Strange phrase, to mean ""feeding to livestock""?"
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2560.205,2560.872,--But the--
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.872,2563.012,"""Home-consumed"" is feed it to your pig?"

2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2564.275,2564.704,I don't think so.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2564.704,2568.38,--that's exactly what that general term... how that general term was used in this case.
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2568.38,2579.5,"But what the Court said, I take it... and I have quoted a lot of the language there... it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in... quote,"
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2583.129,2584.029,"Yes, Your Honor."

2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.044,2611.055,Which is not commerce.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2612.252,2616.617,"--With all respect, what... that's... I was about to make that--"
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2616.617,2618.793,"Well, the Commerce Clause speaks in terms of commerce."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2618.793,2619.027,--Right.
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.495,2663.998,"Well, why is this not economic activity, if you use the term in that broad sense?"
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2677.494,2689.267,"--What made it an economic activity in Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial enterprise, that it was being used on the farm... not in interstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise of the farm."
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.267,2694.819,"Again, I don't think that's... that faithfully represents what the opinion said."

2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.585,2722.641,Did the opinion make a point of that?
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2722.641,2723.362,--Pardon me?
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.362,2725.393,Did the opinion make a point of that?
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2725.393,2728.184,It... it was mentioned in the opinion.
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.244,2735.404,I don't think it was a point of the Court's analysis at all.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2735.404,2738.88,--This--
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.88,2739.546,Could I... could I--
2004.03-1454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.546,2740.265,Let me ask this question.
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2758.995,2760.332,"--Can I pick ""trivial impact""?"
2004.03-1454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.663,2770.517,"No, but if it... ""trivial impact"", is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your view?"
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2770.517,2780.305,"The only effect it could have on the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users from the illicit drug market."
2004.03-1454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2785.042,2788.451,"Well, that would reduce demand and increase price, it seems to me."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2789.221,2795.611,"--Well, it would reduce demand and reduce prices, I think."
2004.03-1454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.022,2797.858,"If you reduce demand, you reduce prices?"
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2798.394,2800.126,--Yes.
2004.03-1454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.075,2802.241,"Oh, you're right."
2004.03-1454,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2803.594,2827.58,"Your whole argument for triviality, though, goes... your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because I take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved... if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2847.76,2850.074,I do not know the answer to that.
2004.03-1454,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2850.074,2854.941,Isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?

2004.03-1454,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2877.674,2878.6,Lots... lots--
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2922.168,2922.919,"Well, two things."
2004.03-1454,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2956.749,2977.091,"Well... but that is circular reasoning, because the whole... your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are... the numbers are so few... the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market."
2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,2986.061,2995.68,Lopez and Morrison stand for the proposition that activities that simply have an effect on the market are not necessary... that does not make them economic.
2004.03-1454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.166,3009.224,"--Remote, remote, remote economic effect."
2004.03-1454,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3009.224,3011.683,It was inference upon inference upon inference.

2004.03-1454,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3036.149,3051.422,Your whole jurisprudence in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got to identify the entire range of potential effect based on the particular character of two individuals in their... in their supply of marijuana.

2004.03-1454,1,38695,randy_e_barnett,,3092.314,3092.725,--Yes.
2004.03-1454,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.725,3096.542,"--which was brought up before, and I just... I've never understood this."
