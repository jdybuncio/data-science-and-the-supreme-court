1984.84-237,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.122,We will hear arguments next in Aguilar against Felton and consolidated cases.
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,86.106,100.014,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at issue in this case is the constitutionality of a key feature of Title 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
1984.84-237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.541,199.361,"General Lee, these programs are offered nationwide."
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,220.441,234.201,"Those that have had experience with Title 1, Justice O'Connor, have almost universally come to the conclusion that off premises just doesn't work, that it is educationally unsound."
1984.84-237,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.79,248.628,Is there then only one school district in the nation that is offering it?
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,248.628,252.746,--I am not certain that that is the case.
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,547.189,551.325,And what has happened to the Pearl case?
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,551.325,565.567,"The Pearl case, Justice Brennan, went to a decision by the three-judge District Court, including findings, and then the appellants... and it was favorable to the program."
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,574.006,576.625,Did they try to appeal it here?
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,576.625,579.827,"Yes, but it was a technical deficiency in the--"
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,579.827,580.96,Dismissed for want of jurisdiction?
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,580.96,581.494,--That is correct.
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,581.494,583.462,Because of failure to meet deadlines?
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,583.462,584.262,That is correct.
1984.84-237,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.138,815.362,"Mr. Solicitor General, what if it turns out that the Grand Rapids program is stricken down under the First Amendment?"
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,818.797,831.188,"Well, I would hope that in that very unfortunate event that the Court would not err twice."
1984.84-237,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.072,843.163,You think the Title 1 program is realistically distinguishable from the Grand Rapids program for constitutional purposes?
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,843.163,843.93,Of course it is.
1984.84-237,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.574,991.359,You mean a Congressional determination as opposed to a state determination?
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1010.356,1015.057,"I do not mean to suggest, Justice Rehnquist, that that is a distinction between this case and the Grand Rapids case."
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1198.827,1202.279,Was the entire Court in agreement with your statement just made?
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1202.279,1209.718,"Lynch versus Donnelly, as you indicated, Justice... as you implied, Justice Blackmun, was a five-four decision."
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1214.888,1217.405,But that is a factual statement that you are making.
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1217.405,1220.174,--Excuse me.
1984.84-237,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.353,1425.023,"Mr. Solicitor, can I ask this one question about any possible impact on establishment clause values?"
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1443.901,1448.286,"No, Justice Stevens, I really don't, for this reason."
1984.84-237,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.625,1457.041,"--But it is a condition, is it not?"
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1457.041,1509.26,"Well, I don't know whether it would be constitutional and therefore acceptable to the Title 1 administrators if there were or were not... the religious objects were or were not removed, but that is a decision that the parochial schools have made in making their application, and I think this Court has observed on a number of occasions that we have to be a bit sensitive about not getting, on the one hand, what is demanded by the Constitution, what is demanded by the Constitution, and on the other hand what is permitted by the Constitution, so close that there isn't any room to steer between that Cylla and Caribda, and frankly, it is almost a damned if you do and damned if you don't option that is left to the church school."
1984.84-237,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1522.25,1540.029,"I take it your answer in effect is, your response is that if the religious symbols were left in the room, your adversaries would hammer you with that fact, and therefore at most removing them neutralizes the problem."
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1540.029,1540.929,Of course.
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1542.747,1546.266,"In this connection, do you have any comment on the Missouri case?"
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1546.266,1557.574,"I agree with Mr. Ripple, Justice Blackmun, that the Missouri case, like all cases, will stand on its own facts and on its own record."
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1557.574,1563.31,"So that if you prevail here, that does not necessarily mean you will prevail in the Missouri case."
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1563.31,1564.377,That is correct.
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1573.166,1583.308,"Well, you sent a copy of it up here, as did your opponents, and at least a cursory review of it would indicate that things were done in the Missouri case which you claim are not done here."
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1583.308,1584.291,I think that's correct.
1984.84-237,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1586.093,1589.812,At least that shows the possibility of abuse.
1984.84-237,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1589.812,1606.054,"--And you have laid... you have put your finger, Justice Blackmun, on what I think is the most important key in this case, and that is that consistent with what the Court said in Wheeler versus Barrera, these cases have to be approached on a case by case basis."
1984.84-237,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1657.538,1666.378,Mr. Geller.
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,1666.378,1683.255,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I am glad that after about one hour and perhaps 15 minutes somebody who stood up to argue before you mentioned Meek against Pittenger."
1984.84-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.009,1771.545,Did the Court of Appeals reject findings of fact that had been made by the District Court?
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,1771.545,1777.099,The Court of Appeals did not reject the findings of fact.
1984.84-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1953.315,1963.42,"Do you mean that if Congress takes some additional action, this result which you describe will prevail?"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,1963.42,1999.861,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, and what I cannot believe is that faced with a report from the Administration and from the Solicitor General that the program just doesn't work off premises, that Congress would insist on wasting money trying to deliver aid to the needy children in parochial schools when they could supply the same aid to needy children from the same background who happen to be attending public schools."
1984.84-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2481.224,2482.543,Private schools.
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,2482.543,2483.126,Yes.
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.126,2484.978,On the premises of private schools.
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,2484.978,2486.128,On the premises of private schools.
1984.84-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2540.296,2551.437,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Geller, that religious dogma could be somehow subtly filtered into remedial mathematics?"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,2551.437,2552.872,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1984.84-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2810.239,2811.339,Mr. Geller?
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,2811.339,2811.955,--Yes.
1984.84-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.955,2817.643,Is there anything in the present record that indicates any incidents like these actually happened?
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,2817.643,2829.367,"No, Your Honor, and that is what the Court of Appeals pointed out, is the reason why there is little, if any, detectable harm."
1984.84-237,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2901.777,2909.466,"That may be the hypothesis of those cases, but I don't think the hypothesis was based on the sort of speculation that you were engaging in."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,2909.466,2914.418,"--Yes, Your Honor, it was based on just that speculation."
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.757,3031.911,"Mr. Geller, these classes go on during... these remedial classes go on during the regular school day, don't they?"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3031.911,3032.878,I understand they do.
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.544,3046.67,"And I would take it that if they weren't going on and weren't being paid for by the Title 1 funds, they would be... the same hours would be taught by private school teachers."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3046.67,3049.789,The same hours would be taught by private school teachers.
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.789,3058.228,And these remedial classes relieve the private school of the necessity of filling up those hours.
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3058.228,3059.961,They do more than that.
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.961,3061.097,"Well, don't they?"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3061.097,3062.813,"They do that, Your Honor, but they do more than that."
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.813,3067.584,"Well, I know, but they... it just means they perhaps don't have to have as many professors."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3072.053,3074.338,"I was coming to that, Your Honor."
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.693,3089.347,"It just saves... yes, but I think it... wouldn't it just very likely save the private school some money?"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3089.347,3093.484,It saves the private schools a tremendous amount of money.
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.284,3102.59,"Even if the private schools would never put on a course like this, it nevertheless would save them money, because--"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3102.59,3105.173,--In the case of remedial instruction particularly so.
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.173,3106.042,--But even if they do nothing--
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3106.042,3113.546,What you are doing is taking the worst students out of the classes and allowing all of the regular students to move forward.
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.546,3131.823,"--Well, I would think if there is X number of hours a week that you used to have a private school teacher to teach, if you no longer have to have a private school teacher to teach those hours, you perhaps can get by with a smaller staff."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3131.823,3135.025,I--
1984.84-237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.025,3136.475,There is no evidence of that?
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3136.475,3137.508,--It is possible.
1984.84-237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3164.294,3165.06,"Well, Mr. Geller--"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3165.06,3173.65,"You are not only aiding the teacher there, but in respect of those students you are aiding the teacher with respect to every other student in the regular classroom."
1984.84-237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3173.65,3177.118,"--Mr. Geller, maybe I don't understand the program."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3192.795,3193.645,I didn't say that.
1984.84-237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3193.645,3198.031,I thought it was taking selected students and giving them some remedial programs.
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3198.031,3199.031,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.84-237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3199.031,3199.8,"Now, is that correct?"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3199.8,3200.817,That's correct.
1984.84-237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3202.067,3204.669,It is not reducing the number of teachers required?
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3204.669,3217.429,"--It does not reduce the number of teachers, and if it did that, the government as it is doing in the Kentucky case might go after the religious schools and try to get the money back."
1984.84-237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3233.105,3239.842,"Mr. Geller, how do you think that the program is generally perceived by the community at large?"
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3250.15,3251.816,--I will tell you how I think of that.
1984.84-237,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3280.169,3285.573,"Your answer is, it just isn't perceived at all, either way."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3287.239,3299.964,"It is not perceived... oh, Your Honor, by the parents whose children are going to the religious schools, it is perceived as a program which aids needy children."
1984.84-237,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3345.028,3350.146,"Mr. Geller, before the noon bell rings, I want to ask you this."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3362.99,3365.423,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1984.84-237,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3387.188,3393.175,"So that's for the Court to be candid in reversing, it must overrule Meek against Pittenger."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3393.175,3451.897,"I would say, Your Honor, that it would in effect be overruling Meek against Pittenger or, if I may, I think it would be... it would err respectfully in this sense, if it took this record and said that this record was proof that the Court had been wrong in Meek against Pittenger in deciding the statute in that case and in numerous other cases facially, because you have no experience, you have no experience in this case other than an experience which is necessarily based on reliance on the good faith and professionalism of the teachers, which was rejected in Meek, and there is nothing in this record that shows you that you have any more reason to rely on the good faith and professionalism of the teachers and guidance counselors in this case than in Meek."
1984.84-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3451.897,3453.33,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Geller."
1984.84-237,1,41388,stanley_geller,,3453.33,3454.663,Thank you.
1984.84-237,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3454.663,3455.265,Do you have anything further?
1984.84-237,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3455.265,3459.634,"Just two brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-237,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3606.83,3608.08,"Thank you, gentlemen."
