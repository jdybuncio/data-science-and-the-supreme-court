1997.96-7151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.126,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-7151, Debra Faye Lewis v. United States."
1997.96-7151,0,23994,frank_granger,,56.748,59.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-7151,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.977,151.799,"Well, I'm not sure that's the backdrop against which that was adopted."
1997.96-7151,0,23994,frank_granger,,177.506,201.031,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, I under... I agree with you, but once the Assimilative Crimes Act was adopted initially in approximately 1825, it was because Congress at that particular point in time had not taken a very proactive role in adopting criminal statutes, so what happened was, you'd have a person commit an act or a criminal... or a crime on a military reservation or in the territories and then be able to flaunt and get away with it."
1997.96-7151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,318.53,320.321,Was that true in 1993?
1997.96-7151,0,23994,frank_granger,,329.296,337.371,"There may have been an amendment, Your Honor, Justice Souter, as to the aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, but the other provisions were specifically--"
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1549.484,1557.368,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-7151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.721,1577.013,"It hinges on either observing them or ignoring them, right?"
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1577.013,1581.714,"I... as to the phrase, act or omission, I think it hinges on interpreting them."
1997.96-7151,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.856,1635.981,"Is it your view, just to sum it up, that we apply the Blockburger test unless there's something in the Federal statute that trumps it?"
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1635.981,1655.123,"--I think it's not... that's not quite our view, because I think... I'll get to made punishable in more detail, but I think the short answer is, one of the features of the Blockburger test is that a greater and a lesser included offense are treated as the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, and that would not be our position with respect to this statute."
1997.96-7151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.111,1677.879,The effect of that kind of interpretation is to say that every poor devil who lives in a Federal enclave is subjected to two total systems of criminal law.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1722.748,1730.843,"--Well, I think first of all it's obviously not unusual for people living outside Federal enclaves to be subject to both Federal and State criminal laws."
1997.96-7151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.681,1775.012,That's a good point.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1790.482,1791.501,--That's exactly right.
1997.96-7151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.501,1793.364,So it is subject to both State and Federal law for the most part.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1793.364,1802.829,"That's exactly right, and I think the resolution of this case ultimately hinges on how the Court views the concept of applying State law norms on Federal enclaves."
1997.96-7151,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1803.119,1812.826,"In fact, the Federal enclave residents may have a better deal, because they are going to get either one or the other, but people off the enclave may get both."
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1812.826,1813.277,--That's correct.
1997.96-7151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1820.092,1824.203,Were you going to focus on the word punishable in this--
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1824.203,1824.393,Let me--
1997.96-7151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1824.393,1825.184,--Was that your second--
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1825.184,1835.44,"--My second... I do want to focus briefly at least on the words act or omission, because I think the meaning of made punishable is easier to follow if the words act or omission are first made clear."
1997.96-7151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.671,1900.052,--That's the same argument made in favor of Blockburger as the test for double jeopardy.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1900.052,1900.763,That's correct.
1997.96-7151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.763,1901.555,You have to know it up front.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1901.555,1927.03,"That's correct, Your Honor, and if the test ultimately turned on whether act, the conduct proved at trial would have violated some Federal statute, first you wouldn't know up front, and second you could even have the bizarre situation in which the defendant attempted to introduce evidence showing that his conduct did, in fact, violate a Federal statute even though the evidence introduced by the prosecution had not shown that, so I think--"
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1927.03,1937.749,"But on your theory, I take it we still would not know what offense was the appropriate offense to focus on, and I take it that's the issue that you deal with under the concept of punishables, is that right?"
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1937.749,1948.073,"--Well, I think when we ask whether an offense is made punishable the offense should be the State law crime with which the individual is charged, and in this case it's very clear what that was."
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1962.002,1969.088,"In other words, if the State law offense is more specifically described, if the level of generality is lower, we look to a State law offense."
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1969.088,1998.827,"--If... in determining whether the offense is made punishable we first look to the State law offense as defined by the... its essential elements, and then the next question is, what does it mean to say that a State law offense has been made punishable by an enactment of Congress, and in our view a State law offense has been made punishable by an enactment of Congress only if Congress has addressed the class of conduct that constitutes the State offense at the same level of specificity as the State."
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.239,2003.172,So yours is a purely analytical test.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2003.172,2003.9,--That's correct.
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2003.9,2005.312,It's not a congressional intent test.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2006.362,2009.624,It is almost exclusively a purely analytical test.
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2024.223,2030.296,"On that point, what if Congress had a child murder statute and then repealed it, and then this case arises?"
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2030.296,2033.719,--I think that would be a closer case.
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2037.162,2039.022,So then it isn't just an analytical test.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2039.022,2066.891,"--It isn't purely an analytical test, and I think the Court in Williams addressed a situation in which there were Federal laws on the Federal enclaves that prohibited adultery, fornication, and what was called carnal knowledge, what is usually termed statutory rape, and the Federal carnal knowledge law set the age of consent at 16, made it a crime to have sexual intercourse with a person not the wife of the wrongdoer who was under the age of 16."
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2106.787,2121.756,"Doesn't that say that you've got to have your analytical criterion plus something more, because in the Williams case the level of specificity was precisely the same, i.e., certain ages are to be considered in deciding what the offense is."
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2153.657,2155.159,"That was certainly the Court's inference, but--"
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2155.159,2163.144,"And is... doesn't that have to be, as it were, an adjunct to your analytical test, because at some times your test is going to produce, as it were, a tie."
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2164.506,2165.475,--I think that's correct.
1997.96-7151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2183.468,2196.136,"So if, in fact, you have a Federal statute that forbids bank robbery in general, then the State could punish a person... it's assimilated because they have a statute that makes it a crime to forbid... to rob a State bank."
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2206.253,2208.714,I think that's probably correct.
1997.96-7151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2208.985,2209.934,"Well, I mean, my goodness--"
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2209.934,2210.224,--At least--
1997.96-7151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2210.224,2212.978,--That sounds like a rather odd result.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2212.978,2217.09,--At least if there were any basis for the conclusion that State banks were in some sense--
1997.96-7151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2217.09,2218.362,"No, no, what... they are special."
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2223.156,2228.66,--It might be the case that if there was nothing different about State banks we could presume that--
1997.96-7151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.66,2229.481,"Well, there is."
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2286.296,2313.144,"--Well, I think the other point that turns... the other point that depends on choice between the Assimilative Crimes Act and the Federal murder statute is that the Louisiana first degree murder statute provides for a mandatory life sentence even if the death penalty is not sought, whereas the Federal murder statute provides that the defendant may be sentenced to any term of years or for life, so even in this case, where the Government didn't seek the death penalty, it had potential practical significance to the penalty that was imposed."
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2349.149,2353.392,"In other words, to look to intent, it would have been an intent argument, an intent of Congress argument."
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2353.392,2354.314,--I think it is an intent of--
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2354.314,2357.135,May I go behind that with this question?
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2423.167,2424.539,--I think there are two responses.
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2448.074,2449.444,But it doesn't say that any more.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2449.444,2450.185,It doesn't say that any more.
1997.96-7151,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2482.766,2500.628,"But you have to... I mean, the corollary of that is, every time Congress enacts a general criminal statute, it's doing it at least with the imputed intent that that statute will, in fact, become inapplicable within the enclaves if there is now or hereafter a more specific State statute, and I--"
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2500.628,2505.58,The Federal statute would not be rendered inapplicable simply because the Assimilative Crimes Act is available.
1997.96-7151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.58,2506.652,--You can have both.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2506.652,2509.424,It's a common rule that this Court has announced most obviously in--
1997.96-7151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.424,2510.195,It would be subject to choice.
1997.96-7151,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2510.195,2511.454,"--Right, subject to choice."
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3233.569,3247.989,"I think the question really is, the Louisiana statute really is more a death penalty statute than merely an attempt to particularly define child killing, but I think--"
1997.96-7151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.989,3249.719,So you're relying on the death penalty.
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3252.04,3254.122,"--Not... no, sir, Your Honor."
1997.96-7151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3254.122,3255.161,But it seems like a good idea to you now.
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3255.412,3257.004,"No, but I--"
1997.96-7151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.004,3259.055,Can you tell me how you get that into the language of the statute?
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3259.055,3264.368,--Because of the fact that you have to bring the punishment along with the crime.
1997.96-7151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.368,3267.17,"Yes, but that isn't the criterion--"
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3267.17,3267.721,Correct.
1997.96-7151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.721,3271.744,--of whether the statute assimilates the State law or not.
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3271.744,3272.726,"I agree with you, Justice--"
1997.96-7151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.726,3272.933,The criterion is act or omission.
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3275.715,3278.059,"--No, I don't believe so, Justice--"
1997.96-7151,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3278.059,3278.657,I didn't think so.
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3291.497,3294.258,"--I would think so, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-7151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.215,3306.066,Which section is it again?
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3306.066,3307.398,"3551, Your Honor."
1997.96-7151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3307.398,3308.377,Thank you.
1997.96-7151,2,23994,frank_granger,,3311.95,3318.956,"Because... what it does, Justice Scalia, is that if you have an assimilated State crime, you then have to look at the guideline that's most analogous to that particular crime."
