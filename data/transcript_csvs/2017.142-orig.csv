2017.142-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.6,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 142 on our original docket, Florida against Georgia. Mr. Garre."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6.6,31.04,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Special Master based his recommendation on two critical premises: First, that Florida has suffered real harm as a result of Georgia's ever-increasing consumption of upstream waters; and, second, that Georgia's consumption is unreasonable and largely unrestrained."
2017.142-orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,75.6,110.88,"Mr. Garre, I thought that the Special Master -- this is at page 63 to 65 of his report -- said that Florida at the trial concentrated only on the harm from the low flows in drought years and it did not address the benefits of increased flow during normal non-drought periods. It didn't even address it, he said, no -- no less showed the benefits that it would gain."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,122.64,122.92,Right.
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,182.6,184.64,Where does the record show that?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,184.64,192.72,"That we would benefit from that? Well, what I can point you to, for example, is the 2012 drought."
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,229.52,232.2,"So here -- here's my difficulty, Mr. Garre, with this argument."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,235.92,237.2,Yeah.
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,237.2,239.96,Is that you have common sense on your side.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,266.8,267.44,Okay.
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,271.48,278.64,"Well, but, you know, I guess what I'm saying is that's your first reaction, but there must have been some reason why it didn't put that into the record."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,278.64,278.88,Right.
2017.142-orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.08,336.0,"But in this -- but in this case, Mr. Garre, the Special Master said: Yeah, there was proof on that point, but it was put in by Georgia, and Georgia's expert said it wouldn't make enough of a difference -- a difference to cure Florida's problem."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,336.0,369.24,"Well -- and I'm going to get back to the -- the evidentiary cites, but on that, Justice Ginsburg, and just to be clear, we think that one of the Special Master's central error was to deal with all of this on the basis of a central -- of a threshold redressability inquiry and that instead what this should have done is gone to the equitable balancing stage of the equitable apportionment proceeding, where the Special Master would have to make all the findings that he did not complete on the -- on the costs that Georgia would incur of a decree, the full range of harms that Florida has suffered."
2017.142-orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.04,376.16,You do agree -- you do agree that you have the burden to show redressability?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,376.16,381.32,"We have the burden like any plaintiff to show redressability in the Article III sense, Justice Kennedy."
2017.142-orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.64,416.52,"You -- you would say you do not have the burden, once you've shown the injury, to show that a consumption cap can help cure the problem."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,416.52,417.84,Well --
2017.142-orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.84,420.08,You do not have the burden to show that?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,420.08,425.12,"I -- I think we do. Certainly, we have to show that a consumption cap is going to work."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,426.92,427.64,"All right. Mr. Garre, but --"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,427.64,429.48,Do we have to show that a mere certainty standard --
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,429.48,433.36,It is very critical for me that you go through the evidence of that.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,433.36,434.0,Yes.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.0,441.68,"Now, just so -- correct me if I'm wrong, the Special Master made two findings."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,470.64,470.88,Right.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,470.88,473.4,-- but I do want to go to the non-drought time.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,473.4,474.68,Right.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,474.68,485.32,"And as I read his report, he -- he does say there was no evidence of the cap providing you with more water."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,503.32,503.6,Sure.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,503.6,503.84,Alright.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,503.84,512.4,"I mean, first of all, just to be clear, if Georgia's consumption is limited, it's going to result in more water in the system and that water is going to flow through --"
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,512.4,514.96,And that's Justice Kagan's logic point.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,514.96,515.12,"Well, no --"
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,515.12,515.64,But I'm -- I'm --
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,515.64,517.56,-- the Special Master recognizes that because --
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,517.56,517.72,Yes.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,517.72,526.0,"-- for example, on pages 6 and 30 -- 37 of his report, he recognizes that the -- the Woodruff facilities, a run-of-the-river facility, water's going to go through it."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,529.08,530.8,They -- they -- they agree with you.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,530.8,532.56,That water is going to go through.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,576.04,576.68,I -- I -- I agree.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,576.68,577.08,Okay.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,577.08,585.52,But where do they quantify it to show that the improvement would be meaningful? How -- how --
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,585.52,596.2,"All of those talk about how adding additional water, even in non-drought periods, helping the system rejuvenate is going to have a meaningful, beneficial effect."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,597.32,603.6,"And so your argument about the standard is that you didn't have to prove the exact amount, you just had to prove that it was meaningful?"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,603.6,604.24,Exactly.
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,615.6,615.88,Would --
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,615.88,618.52,"Mr. Garre, you talk about a burden-shifting regime."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,628.76,659.64,"Well, actually, I think, and this is laid out in Colorado versus New Mexico, Footnote 13, I think, is first, we have the burden, by clear and convincing evidence, to show that we have suffered real harm as a result of Georgia's upstream consumption. Once we meet that burden, the Special Master I think concluded that we did, or he assumed we did at the very least, then the burden shifts to Georgia essentially to show that the costs of the decree would be so much that they outweigh the injury that Florida is suffering. And part of that inquiry --"
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,659.64,669.8,"Well, now, does the burden ever shift back to you to prove your case at the end of the day that the benefits you seek outweigh the harms you'd cause or --"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,669.8,670.84,"Well, I -- that's --"
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,670.84,675.88,"-- or does the burden ultimately rest with Georgia as a defendant, in your view --"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,675.88,676.8,I think --
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,676.8,678.64,-- and can that be -- can that be right?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,678.64,697.52,"First of all, I think whichever way you think the burden lies at the end, we meet it under the correct redressability standard. Second of all, I think what this Court has talked about is when you get to that equitable balancing stage, the burden is on the diverting state to show that it's -- that it -- it either cost too much or it's not worth it."
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,697.52,711.64,I had thought -- I had thought that the burden ultimately was for the plaintiff who wishes to alter the status quo to show that the benefits he wishes to obtain significantly outweigh the harms that the relief he seeks would cause.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,711.64,711.96,Well --
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,711.96,712.6,Am I wrong about that?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,712.6,721.08,"Well, I think you are under Colorado versus New Mexico, but -- but if you are right about that, Your Honor, I would say that we have met that and that the Special Master's --"
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,721.08,721.24,Okay.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,724.8,725.32,Sure.
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,725.32,729.32,How -- how do you meet that high threshold seeking --
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,729.32,729.68,Okay.
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,729.68,731.0,-- seeking this Court's equitable --
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,731.0,734.88,"First of all, assume no change in the Corps operations."
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,769.52,772.04,"Well, let's just stick with the non-drought operations."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,777.88,784.08,I think we have to show that it is a likelihood of at least partial redress.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,786.52,801.72,"Let's assume that. Let's go to the real question, which is if it's your burden to prove the balance, assume that, how have you shown that the benefit to you is greater than the cost to them?"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,801.72,802.08,Okay.
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,802.08,802.84,Thank you.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,802.84,807.44,"First of all, Justice Sotomayor, to answer that question, you have to know what the costs to them are."
2017.142-orig,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,822.84,840.64,"So is that your real beef then, that at the end of the day that the Special Master went off track on redressability, with non-drought years, you have redressability, and that he should have, therefore, conducted a more thorough balancing test in weighing the equities on the non-drought years at the very least?"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,840.64,857.84,"Yes, ultimately that's what we think should happen next, and in that proceeding what you would take into account is, okay, what's the full extent of Florida's injuries? The Special Master has found that we've been gravely injured with respect to -- to oysters. He didn't make findings on the threatened Gulf sturgeon or the threatened mussels in the Apalachicola River."
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,859.56,861.36,"But, again, this goes back to my first question."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,897.0,906.2,"Your Honor, there was significant evidence put in through our witnesses, for example, Dr. Hornberger, about the -- the benefits of the water coming through and --"
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,906.2,909.84,"Well, there are two kinds of evidence that you might be talking about."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,924.4,925.96,Yes.
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,925.96,932.68,-- if these caps went into place? And that's the place where it seems to me that there's kind of a vacuum.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,932.68,966.64,"Well, I don't think so. And, you know, what I would point you to, for example, is the United States' post-trial brief. If you look at page 19 of that brief, I think, it recognizes that during low flow periods, not the extreme low flows but the low flows bumping up on the worst possible harm, during that period, additional water coming in would go through to Georgia. And the example that it has is if you had a flow rate at the border of 6,000 cfs and additional water coming through of 2,000 cfs, that you then have 8,000 going through."
2017.142-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1055.6,1056.64,Is that the March 30 decree?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1056.64,1057.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.142-orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.72,1058.8,Okay.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1058.8,1089.08,"And I think if -- that's on page 18 of that document. And the United States importantly recognizes that, in its brief, at page 30 of its brief, that that -- that a decree in this case would form a part of the constellation of laws that the Army Corps of Engineers would have to look to in order to decide how to respond to that. We don't know what the Army Corps of Engineers is going to do, but I think common sense would tell you that any good government actor would look at a decision by this Court and seek to adjust its operations in a way that would facilitate that decree."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1207.68,1210.36,"You haven't answered Justice Kagan's question, though."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1214.72,1215.04,Right.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1215.04,1226.8,"She seems to be saying the link that you haven't proven is that, by putting in the consumption limit, that that water would actually reach Florida."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1226.8,1227.28,"Oh, okay."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1227.6,1229.6,That -- that I think is her question.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1230.56,1231.0,Okay.
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1242.4,1248.4,Have you at all quantified how much water you were going to get as a result of these consumption caps?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1248.4,1250.04,"And -- and I think -- again, I think we did."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1256.52,1258.2,"If you have those cites, mention them."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1259.6,1274.48,"And I think, again, I mean, all that the Special Master -- the lens that he was looking at the record in was whether we had shown that there was a guarantee that the Corps would exercise its discretion in a particular way, and he concluded that we haven't shown to certainty that the water would get through."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1274.88,1278.64,"Do you have another cite besides the one you've mentioned, Hornberger?"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1278.64,1280.8,"Well, in terms of the -- the water that would go through?"
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1280.8,1281.04,Yes.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1281.04,1285.72,"I mean, I also would point you to the government's brief, that recognizes on page 33 --"
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1285.72,1288.88,"It doesn't quantify it, though."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1288.88,1304.16,"It -- well, we're talking about -- our case was focused on showing that a consumption cap would result in anywhere from 2,000 to 1,000 additional cfs flowing through and that -- the limits we put in place."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1308.16,1308.52,I see.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1308.52,1308.72,And --
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1308.72,1313.76,So you're saying that the drought information holds true at minimum for the non-drought one? So a certain amount --
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1313.76,1317.32,"Well, that holds flew -- true for the water going through."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1376.36,1380.88,So really what the issue is -- let me see if I understand it.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1380.88,1381.16,Sure.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1381.16,1396.56,"You claim that -- I have to go back to the report and read it now to find this -- that the Special Master accepted that a consumption cap of 1- to 2,000 at minimum would flow through, drought and non-drought years."
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1396.56,1397.44,"Well, I think -- let me --"
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1397.44,1397.84,Or I --
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1397.84,1411.12,"-- let me say it this way: I think the Special Master did find that we didn't prove to a certainty, a certainty, there was no guarantee, that's what he said on page 69, that the Corps would allow additional water through during drought periods."
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1411.12,1412.28,That I know it's what it said.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1412.28,1412.48,Right.
2017.142-orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1412.48,1414.24,I don't care about what happens with the Corps.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1424.24,1433.68,"He -- he didn't -- he certainly didn't frame it this way -- that way, Your Honor, in terms of you can't say that I found that X amount is going on to go through. I don't think he was quart -- he felt himself --"
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1433.68,1437.32,"Is your view, Mr. Garre -- talk about non-drought operations --"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1437.32,1437.48,Sure.
2017.142-orig,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1437.48,1449.44,"-- all right? Is your view that if a consumption cap saves -- you know, saves 2,000 cubic feet of water, that all of that necessarily gets through to Florida?"
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1449.44,1450.08,Yes.

2017.142-orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1553.88,1555.04,-- so I could ask them that.
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1597.12,1603.56,"Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, I think -- I think one way to think about the Corps' position in this case, which has evolved a bit --"
2017.142-orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.56,1605.6,Am I basically on base?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1605.6,1609.56,I think you're on base to think that life would be a lot easier if the Corps had intervened --

2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1611.36,1612.4,But I think --
2017.142-orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1612.4,1612.8,What?
2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1612.8,1618.32,-- I think one question is -- is the light -- what the Corps has said to you in its brief and the ultimate --
2017.142-orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.32,1623.0,"Well, what the Corps has said to me at the moment, I'm assuming, is sort of vague."

2017.142-orig,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1629.36,1629.84,Yes.

2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,1695.4,1716.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Florida has premised this entire case on the proposition that a cap on Georgia's water consumption alone would result in a material increase in water to Florida during drought without any change to Army Corps operations. After two years of discovery and a five-week trial, Florida failed to prove that case."
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1716.8,1719.32,"Well, but I don't think they've premised it entirely on that."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,1754.0,1758.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, we -- we do need to distinguish between drought periods and non-drought periods."
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1797.92,1798.56,Right.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,1798.56,1799.84,-- may not do anything.
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.84,1800.08,Right.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,1830.68,1830.76,Well --
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1830.76,1836.44,"Instead they just want to say, well, look, they're going to make a different decision if they've got more water to allocate."

2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1837.04,1838.32,You'll be able to argue that.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,1840.92,1845.36,"Well, Florida can certainly argue that, but the Corps has issued its Water Control Manual."

And then tomorrow, because they convince the mayor of Atlanta, whatever, to drink more Pepsi or something, or whatever they drink, Coca-Cola, I imagine, and -- and -- (Laughter.)"
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1894.56,1896.36,-- and whatever reason that is they --

2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1898.84,1904.24,"Yeah, I know that. The -- the -- the -- the 3,000 cubic feet comes down to Flint."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,1918.96,1923.24,I would quarrel with the hypothetical because there's no possibility of that much water being generated for consumption.
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1923.24,1927.2,"Well, I'm just using it as a big example, but it's some amount. It's some amount."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,1929.24,1929.68,I accept the amount.
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.68,1929.8,Okay.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,1980.28,1995.96,"Justice Breyer, the Corps is governed by a panoply of federal statutes, congressional dictates and mandates, as to how to control the water in this basin. And it is not as simple as if extra water comes in, then you just pass it through to Florida because they have articulated one concern."
2017.142-orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2035.6,2035.8,Can we --

2017.142-orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2036.4,2064.72,"-- can we agree -- can we agree that a cap at the very least would prevent -- would prevent the situation in Florida from getting worse? That is, that if we do nothing, then the situation in Florida can get worse, even worse than it is now. If there is a cap, then Florida is protected at least to that extent."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2069.28,2071.04,"That's not correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.142-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2082.48,2138.36,"So, what do we do with their non-drought statement in their brief where they say the U.S. does not mean to suggest that a consumption cap would provide no benefit to the Corps' operation in the basin or to Florida? And they say: ""As explained to the Special Master, increased basin inflows would generally benefit the ACF system by delaying the onset of drought operations, by allowing the Corps to meet the 5,000 cfs minimum flow during longer -- flow longer during extended drought, and by quickening the resumption of normal operations after drought."" And, in fact, your adversary points to a lot of history showing that when there's increased water, the Corps gives increased water under its own protocol."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2149.76,2164.72,"Justice Sotomayor, the Special Master at page 65 found, unequivocally, that Florida presented no evidence assessing the impact of a consumption cap on shortening the Corps' drought operations or on increased pass-through flows during --"
2017.142-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2164.72,2194.8,"Well, if I disagree, if I can point to, and your colleague has suggested, to a lot of record evidence, not just the SG's statement, but statements from Dr. Allan, Dr. Glibert, Dr. Greenblatt, and from other experts showing that, would the -- would we just say the Special Master was wrong or that he didn't explain why that evidence was inadequate?"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2194.8,2196.64,"Well, he wasn't wrong. He was absolutely correct."
2017.142-orig,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2219.16,2245.0,"Well, Mr. Primis, how is it possible that it wouldn't pass through? I mean, if I understand what Mr. Garre said, it's something like this: If Georgia consumes 2,000 feet less of water, just as a matter of physics, it's all going to get to Florida. So -- and now there does seem, as you suggest, to be not all that much in the record showing that that's true."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2249.24,2250.56,With regard --
2017.142-orig,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2250.56,2254.92,That all of that saved water will eventually go south?
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2254.92,2259.96,The water -- it is a question of timing and when the water will go south.
2017.142-orig,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2264.16,2265.24,"No, but I was talking about non-drought."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2265.24,2265.96,Correct.
2017.142-orig,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2303.96,2316.48,"Well, can you give me an example of how it would be that an additional 2,000 units saved in Georgia would not benefit Florida to the same amount? How would that be possible?"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2316.48,2317.08,Certainly.

2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2332.4,2333.24,Okay.
2017.142-orig,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2333.24,2336.6,-- and maybe -- maybe you can direct your attention to the -- the Corps' own statement --
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2336.6,2337.16,Sure.
2017.142-orig,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2337.16,2341.44,"-- and the SG's statement, which Justice Sotomayor read, maybe that'll help move us along --"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2341.44,2341.64,But --
2017.142-orig,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2341.64,2347.12,"-- which suggests that in non-drought operations, there will be more water going to Florida --"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2347.12,2347.48,Well --

2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2366.92,2374.08,"Justice Gorsuch, the United States says explicitly in its brief at 17 that those are hypotheticals."
2017.142-orig,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2379.04,2391.36,"No, there is no precise quantification, but on page 28, they say that it -- I'm not going to repeat it all again, but pretty darn clearly that they anticipate that non-drought operations, there will be more water going through --"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2391.36,2391.4,Well --
2017.142-orig,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2391.4,2394.32,-- and that that will help diminish drought operations.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2394.32,2395.68,"Well, Georgia did quantify this."
2017.142-orig,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2420.08,2427.44,"No, but when you're in -- when you're in non-drought operations, how is it possible for the amount of water saved in Georgia not to benefit Florida?"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2427.44,2428.0,Okay.
2017.142-orig,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2441.52,2448.24,"Well, there must be a set of months that are dry, so that Florida wants more water, but not drought."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2448.24,2462.16,"And the Corps' operations account for that, when -- and that's baked into the chart that the Special Master included in his -- his report. But the important point is Florida, it's not a mistake that Florida didn't present this evidence."
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2480.6,2480.72,I have some kind of --
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2480.72,2482.24,It still started in August.
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2482.24,2488.0,"-- I have some kind in front of me, a Bedient Demo 13, do you know what I'm talking about, this thing?"

2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.48,2489.0,Okay.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2524.48,2526.12,"No, Justice Breyer."
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.12,2526.52,"No, okay."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2526.52,2528.08,What I'm trying to tell you is that Dr. Bedient --
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2528.08,2528.12,Yeah.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2528.12,2530.48,-- is the expert that the Special Master credited --
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2530.48,2532.84,"I know he was on your side, but that doesn't --"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2532.84,2536.92,But -- but the rest of it -- another part of his analysis shows that we don't shorten the drought operations.
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2542.16,2542.4,All right.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2542.84,2543.28,They're random.
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.28,2551.24,Is there -- probably your answer is going to be -- but I don't like to turn this thing on who presented what and on what time.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2604.08,2604.56,The Court --
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.56,2606.12,"I mean not in Atlanta, south of Atlanta."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2606.12,2607.96,The Court surely has the power under its original jurisdiction --
2017.142-orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.96,2609.0,Would that make sense?
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2609.0,2610.48,"It would not, for two reasons."
2017.142-orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2624.56,2651.8,"Except that the government tells us that in its protocols, it's not charged with looking at the harm we're looking at; that it's not charged with looking at the harm to the oysters or the mussels or the other things that are being affected here. So I don't think it's done a study that addresses the issues of the harms that are at -- in question in this litigation."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2651.8,2652.68,That's not correct.
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2685.16,2696.92,"So what -- what is the standard that you would require Florida to meet? Presumably they don't have to show to an absolute certainty that, you know, they'll -- they'll benefit in a particular way, but what do you think the standard is?"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2696.92,2701.8,The standard is that Florida should be required to show by clear and convincing evidence that its requested --
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2701.8,2704.12,"Where did that come from, by clear and convincing evidence?"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2704.12,2708.92,That comes from Colorado versus New Mexico and Colorado versus Kansas. It's consistent --
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2708.92,2714.16,"Is that at the equitable weighing stage or as an initial matter, almost of standing?"
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2714.16,2716.32,"Well, it -- this is not a standing question."
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2733.32,2733.76,Okay.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2737.24,2740.64,That their requested remedy will provide a material benefit.
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2788.24,2791.36,"I get -- but, I mean, obviously that depends on what you mean by redress."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2808.72,2809.72,It's not redress.
2017.142-orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2820.96,2821.76,But why is that so?
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2821.76,2822.4,What?
2017.142-orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2822.4,2836.56,"I think one of the things that we're told is that the Corps, although it may not be required to do so, has exceeded the minimum flows whenever water is available."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2848.68,2854.2,"Well, in drought periods, it shoots for roughly 5,000 cfs."
2017.142-orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2856.96,2857.36,But why are we --
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2857.36,2858.56,-- sometimes it rains --
2017.142-orig,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.56,2865.72,"-- but why are we dividing drought and non-drought? If the water is eventually going to get to Florida, that will help Florida."
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2877.68,2882.8,"Not immediate, but the -- the time when the Corps is in drought operations can be very lengthy."
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2901.08,2902.2,You can finish your sentence.
2017.142-orig,1,62910,craig_s_primis,,2902.2,2909.08,What the whole trial was about was can they get it during a drought? And the Army Corps -- and all the evidence shows conclusively that they cannot.
2017.142-orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2909.72,2922.6,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler."
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2922.6,2947.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case has proceeded from the outset on the premise that the Corps of Engineers' operations have to be taken as a given and any decree by this Court would not require a change in the Corps' operations. That flowed directly from the fact that the United States is a required party but has not been joined because it can't -- it hasn't waived its sovereign immunity."
2017.142-orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2953.8,2958.44,"Well, we don't -- maybe -- maybe we can order the Corps and maybe we can't, but surely you will."
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2979.32,2986.44,"Yes, but let me -- let me explain the role of the Corps' operations here because I think it's important."
2017.142-orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.92,3082.08,"So, why don't you just waive the sovereign immunity, get into this, and try to help the Special Master reach an equitable solution?"
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3082.08,3089.32,"For -- for the reason that I -- that I said, that here you have an act of Congress that delegates the power to the Corps in the first instance."
2017.142-orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3105.48,3113.28,So what about a consumption cap? It changes the rules on the ground.
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3128.48,3133.2,"Well, it depends how that plays out."
2017.142-orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3160.88,3166.28,But you've taken no position on whether that extra release would actually provide a material benefit?
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3166.28,3166.56,Right.
2017.142-orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3168.64,3171.56,Why not? Could we ask you to take that position?
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3171.56,3179.28,"I -- I -- I suppose you -- the -- the government could participate that -- in that as an evidentiary matter, but -- but it seems --"
2017.142-orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3179.28,3181.16,I asked a very specific question.
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3185.36,3188.0,I -- I suppose you could if --
2017.142-orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3188.0,3193.96,"What do you think? In other words, what do you think we should do? (Laughter.)"
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3193.96,3195.44,I --
2017.142-orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3195.44,3197.0,Do you think we should --
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3197.0,3212.48,"From the -- from the United States' perspective, we think that what -- we are not taking a position on whether Florida has shown that -- that a cap would produce sufficient water to justify the cap in terms of benefits to Florida. Our interest here --"
2017.142-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3212.48,3223.68,"But you do think, Mr. Kneedler, am I wrong, your -- your brief says that if there were a consumption cap, Florida would get material amounts, more water."
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3223.68,3225.16,There would be additional water.
2017.142-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3248.68,3268.68,"So suppose that we think that looking at the record that was before the Special Master, there was quite a lot of evidence that, with more water, the ecosystem would be improved. Do you think -- as I hear you, you're saying: And there would be more water. However much water is saved in Georgia comes to Florida."
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3268.68,3300.28,"No, not -- that -- that is not necessarily true because the Corps operates the five dams as an integrated whole and it does so in part on basin inflow but in part on how much water is stored in the reservoirs at any particular time of year. So there are certain situations, looking at total basin inflow, for example, if more water came in from the Flint River, that would free up water to be stored upstream for release during -- during low-flow periods. It's operated as an integrated whole."
2017.142-orig,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3302.24,3305.16,And that's true even in non-drought operations?
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3305.16,3306.4,Yes.
2017.142-orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3365.64,3369.36,"But I just -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but it does seem fairly important."
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3387.68,3387.92,Well --
2017.142-orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.92,3391.48,And -- and -- and you say you'll take it into account.
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3391.48,3412.2,"Well, several things about that. To say that Florida is equitably entitled to more water can't ignore the regime that the Corps of Engineers has put in place because equity follows the law in an original case as any other. So if the allocation that the Corps has made, I think, has to be taken as a given in the Court deciding what -- what is an equitable apportionment."
2017.142-orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3412.88,3420.2,"Well, you have said -- you have said you don't have any stake in the argument about whether more water would help Florida."
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3431.88,3439.48,"Well, the -- the Corps is the expert through the process of the -- of the manual, which was exactly what Congress meant."
2017.142-orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3473.76,3482.16,"But we don't know -- see, I'm sure you've got this point, but, I mean, I don't know what to do without knowing what the Corps is likely to do."
2017.142-orig,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3497.64,3540.8,"Well, what -- one course would be, if -- if you agree that Florida has not made the showing that it -- that it said that it would make, that there would be material benefits from the increased flows, Florida has the ability to challenge the Corps of Engineers' master manual and say that it does not provide sufficient downstream flows for Florida or to petition the Corps to adopt a new -- a new manual and revise it. It's not at all clear that the governing statutes -- may I finish? -- even allow the Corps of Engineers to allocate additional water for the Apalachicola Bay or that to do so would be consistent with balancing all the other responsibilities the Corps has."
2017.142-orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3540.8,3543.32,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Garre, two minutes."
2017.142-orig,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3543.32,3546.76,"Thank you, Your Honor. First, the problem here is Georgia's consumption."
2017.142-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3564.68,3594.04,"Mr. Garre, what do we do with the Special Master's conclusion on 65-66, where they credit the report by Georgia's expert, Dr. Bedient, and Dr. Bedient did a modeling and came to the conclusion that even if there was extra flow, it wouldn't materially change the environmental impact?"
2017.142-orig,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3594.04,3594.48,Right.
2017.142-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3594.48,3597.28,That's your greatest challenge.
2017.142-orig,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3597.28,3600.16,Special Master is relying on the wrong redressability standard.
2017.142-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3607.6,3621.24,"If we -- if we say that he couldn't, that he had to follow the Army Corps' and assume that the Army Corps' protocol would control, is Bedient right?"
2017.142-orig,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3621.24,3626.36,"No, because he wouldn't be addressing non-drought conditions where we're going to get benefits with additional water coming through."
2017.142-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3627.0,3629.64,"Bedient did it on just drought conditions, not on --"
2017.142-orig,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3629.64,3632.32,That's what the focus. The evidence is the water is going to come through the United States --
2017.142-orig,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3632.32,3638.68,So why does the Special Master rely upon it with the non-drought situation?
2017.142-orig,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3638.68,3655.88,"Your Honor, in the context of that discussion, I -- I don't think that reliance on that can support the conclusion that this case should end. If I could give you some more evidence, Shanahan direct at paragraph 60 explains the water that goes through. Shanahan's testimony, page 25, 23, says the water is going to go through."
2017.142-orig,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3707.4,3708.24,"Thank you, counsel."
