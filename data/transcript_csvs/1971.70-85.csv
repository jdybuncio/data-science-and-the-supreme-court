1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.312,"Number 70-85, Branzburg against Hayes."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,28.945,32.509,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.055,458.779,Mr. Zingman.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,458.779,459.157,Yes sir.
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.157,463.184,"Judge Meigs did do more for your client than Judge Pound had, did he not?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,463.184,481.84,"Yes sir, Judge Meigs entered a four paragraph protective order which in the first three paragraphs is modeled very much like the order Judge Zepilli (ph) entered in the Caldwell case, but then he took it all back in the fourth paragraph because he said, ""not withstanding anything,"" in the first three paragraphs."
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.146,500.183,So at your position and the Judge Miggs order was for practical purpose as the same thing as Judge Pound.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,500.183,501.577,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,501.577,504.052,"The news article, there was only one, was there?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,504.052,505.704,There were two articles.
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,505.704,510.148,One appears on pages 3 and 5 of the appendix?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,510.148,515.916,Yes sir and the other appears on pages 30 to 42 of the appendix.
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.916,521.023,And the first one was published in the Louisville Courier --
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,521.023,522.985,Both were published in the Louisville Courier Journal.
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,522.985,526.172,"Yes, but one had a Dateline Frankfurt."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,528.755,531.218,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.218,532.13,And the local -- am I right?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,532.13,533.783,"Local, yes sir."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,533.783,536.285,"Did not have a dateline, but it is a local story in the local paper?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,536.285,542.517,"Yes sir, the Courier Journal is a daily or general circulation throughout the state."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.517,545.35,"Throughout the state, right."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,545.35,562.79,"Following upon Judge Meigs’ action as I stated the Court of Appeals, entered its modified opinion in the Hayes case, and denied us the relief we asked in the Meigs case."
1971.70-85,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,785.172,786.539,"Mr. Zingman, let me interrupt you there."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,786.539,788.576,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,788.576,791.338,"In passing, how would you define a newsman?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,806.909,810.036,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,886.363,893.875,"As we are talking about the First Amendment, the First Amendment protects free speech as well as it does in free press, is it not?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,893.875,895.15,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,895.15,906.0,And I suppose your argument based as it is upon the First Amendment could not logically be confined to newsman however defined.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,927.195,928.128,I would not --
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,928.128,929.411,Why is it confined to a newsman?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,932.239,942.154,"Yes but, Mr. Justice Stewart, I would not agree that logically carried to its conclusion, everyone under the exercise of the grant of free speech would have the right to refuse to testify."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,942.154,942.912,Why?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,942.912,948.265,"Well, specifically we are talking about press, which is also mentioned in the First Amendment."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.265,951.988,They both are equally protected of free press and free speech.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,951.988,970.424,"In the records, in these cases demonstrate, at least we believe, and we would urge upon the Court, that the compulsion of testimony by newsmen would have an inhibiting effect upon the ability of the press to fulfill its function."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.836,986.468,"Well if you’re right, it would be a direct impingement upon a person’s right of free speech, because the right of free speech includes the right to keep silent, does it not?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,986.468,987.498,The right of free speech including --
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,987.498,992.039,"Not inhibiting it is just a direct violation of it, if you are right, in your basic argument."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,992.039,992.421,No sir!
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,999.368,1013.814,"No, it never has, nor has this Court ever interpreted the right of free press to include the right of a newspaperman to defy a subpoena of a grand jury, so these both would be new decisions?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1013.814,1034.731,"That is correct, and our position is that the record here amply demonstrates that it is a necessary concomitant of the First Amendment free press right to protect the newsman that the laws in not compelling testimony is so little in the balancing process that we urge that the right be protected, if I follow your hypothesis."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1046.775,1047.917,It certainly does.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1058.017,1059.992,"Well, I don’t know whether it would or not, all I can --"
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1059.992,1061.708,"Well, it’s very fair that it would, isn’t it?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1065.544,1077.26,"No, because I do not believe that in the context of speech, there is the assurance, that when confidences are given, that they will not be disclosed as part of the compulsory process of a grand jury."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1094.85,1096.686,The First Amendment protects them both.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1096.686,1106.292,"Yes it does, and the Court has made a different balancing considerations, and different applications of the First Amendment."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.292,1120.728,"Well, let us suppose this reporter has been accompanied by a member of the state legislature who was simply interested in informing himself in connection with perhaps the revision of the State Criminal Code."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1140.196,1159.535,"We would make that distinction, Mr. Justice White, but of course in that case it would be meaningless anyway because the information could be obtained by others which would end the quest, but doctrinally, we make the distinction because we are talking about freedom of the press and the necessity to provide the information for the public."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.189,1192.43,"Well, the interested parent and the head of the Criminal Law Revision Commission says that, we just cannot get the information to allow us to conduct our business, run our families, and to run this committee, if we are not allowed to respect confidences."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1192.43,1202.752,"My response to that would have to be that the Framers of the Constitution did not put up an Amendment in for them, and there is a First Amendment dealing with the press."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.752,1206.607,They are covered as Mr. Justice Stewart said by the free speech provision.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1206.607,1215.647,"Well, in so far as the exercise of free speech is concerned, I merely be repeating my self in the remarks I made in response to Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.345,1230.899,"And I might ask you also, do you say that the newsman’s claim of privilege must automatically be respected once he claims it."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1239.889,1254.792,Our formulation would call for the kind of investigation in an open hearing that is made by Courts today when the Fifth Amendment privilege is asserted.
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.693,1272.262,"What do you think in this case, this is a practical matter, a reporter goes and sees what he says and reports it."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1293.773,1300.589,"Well, this Mr. Justice White, I think goes to the heart of what we’re talking about and why this is so important."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1359.965,1363.886,Shouldn’t the public have a right to know the sources of that information?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1363.886,1375.729,"Well, I think the important thing is for the public to have the right to know, and if having the right to know the sources will destroy the ability to obtain the information, then it leads us no place."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1375.729,1388.656,Isn’t the public going to make its evaluation of the information depending on the credibility of the source and the possible self-interest of the source?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1388.656,1414.506,"Well, that’s part of it and I suppose in that quantum, the public will also weigh the fact that these people wanted to remain unidentified, but obviously if you are going to print news about what is presently and illegal activity, you are not going to get information voluntarily from those who are participating in such activity if it is going to immediately lead to their arrest and prosecution."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1417.802,1426.106,Let me ask you a hypothetical question to pursue the point of both Justice Stewart and Justice White embarked on.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1461.963,1469.93,"Not under the definition which I offered Mr. Justice Blackmun, I believe of what a newsman is, because --"
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1469.93,1475.534,Justice Stewart suggested that it’s a difficult distinction to make.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1475.534,1478.999,"It is a difficult distinction, but when I think, that has to be made."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1478.999,1486.948,"But, the reporter is protected and the citizen who writes the letter to the editor is not?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1486.948,1502.263,"In the application with the definition that we make, that would be the case, but again Mr. Chief Justice I must emphasize that we are not talking about reporters who are reporters as against other individuals."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1510.127,1526.259,"Well, doesn’t that standard precisely fit my hypothetical public-spirited citizen who is trying to get the flow of information that neither the law enforcement authorities nor the local press is delivering to the public."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1526.259,1534.741,"As an abstract composition it would and I might agree in a particular case, but here the First Amendment talks about the press, it doesn’t --"
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1534.741,1538.128,"This man is using the press, isn’t he, vicariously?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1538.128,1547.241,"Yes sir, but we have to arrive at a definition and for definitional purposes we have defined the press as one who want to continue his basis does this, not a volunteer."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.241,1583.541,"Historically in this country, and in other countries, particularly our own beginning 200 years ago, wasn’t the letter to the editor a great means of use by essayist and pamphleteers who communicated to the public in much the way the columnists do today, with any less for Madison or Jefferson, or any of these men, any less exercising the freedom of press, because they did not get paid for writing their letters to the editor?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1583.541,1614.265,"Well, I would concede that pamphleteer in such may, under the formulation we make be included in a particular case, then they have to be some weighing and balancing, but as a starting point, we believe that in the tradition of this Court going one step at a time that you start with a definition of the press along the lines that I have suggested, and that we move with experience from there."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.265,1621.079,"Under your definition, you would not automatically include all the authors of the federalist papers, would you?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1621.079,1625.262,"Well, I am not familiar with to what extent they would print, but I would suppose not."
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.619,1629.49,Mr. Zingman.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1629.49,1631.125,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.125,1638.666,Following up on the same line of question with which you have already been barraged.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1677.253,1690.586,"We are not prepared to urge that upon the Court, because again while that maybe a freedom of speech problem, it is not a freedom of the press problem."
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.516,1712.629,What about to research and write on a book on criminology?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1712.629,1722.487,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall I think that is the same answer I have just given Mr. Justice Rehnquist that that does not in our judgment fit in to the constitutional framework."
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1723.71,1725.754,Author of the book doesn’t uncover?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1725.754,1727.729,"Not in that sense, no."
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1727.729,1733.618,"Well, in this case, your man witnessed a crime, correct?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1733.618,1736.037,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.037,1745.753,"Suppose that instead of making hashish, they were making a bomb to blow up the Capitol in Frankfort, would the privilege still apply?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1745.753,1746.591,Well --
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1746.591,1749.227,I just want to know how far you’d go with this crime.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1749.227,1766.664,"At this time the questioning by the members of the Court started, I was at the point of stating to the Court the standards that we would apply, and the third standard that I have to offer, if I may, it will respond to your question."
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1829.888,1837.904,"Well, suppose they were making a bomb to blow up John Doe, of ordinary citizen, it wouldn’t be covered, would it?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1837.904,1840.331,"Yes, it would in terms of my third --"
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1840.331,1842.947,I thought you said they’d be some of national importance --
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1842.947,1844.004,National security.
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1844.004,1845.754,"-- but killing John Doe, isn’t?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1845.754,1850.361,"National security, human life, or liberty."
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1850.361,1851.959,"Well, or liberty?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1851.959,1854.128,"Yes sir, human life or liberty."
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1862.101,1865.953,"My old problem is, crime is a crime."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1866.803,1867.192,"Well, I think --"
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.192,1869.348,You’re going to draw a line among crime.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1869.348,1878.355,I think there are distinctions in this Court has recognized that distinctions can be drawn as between crimes.
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1915.7,1917.41,You got another one?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1917.41,1918.435,Not at the moment sir.
1971.70-85,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1918.435,1919.605,I don’t think so.
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.605,1928.361,Do you think the Court has ever adopted Mr. Justice Jackson’s view of that bifurcation of the Amendment?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1928.361,1935.238,"I have known of no specific application, but I suggest that it is not unreasonable argument at all."
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.238,1948.513,"Under your test, Mr. Zingman, supposing that the reporter had witnessed a murder, but there was no reason to believe that the man was in the business of murdering people, it was a one time offense."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1952.927,1954.038,Subpoena the reporter?
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.038,1955.317,Yes.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1955.317,1959.166,"In under our balance and test, that would be possible, yes."
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.166,1974.581,"But, I thought it was danger to national security, liberty; you would regard the prosecution of an already completed offense as a way of in affect, averting that sort of danger?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,1974.581,1983.696,"I would say that would come in under the balancing act, and it might be permissible for the Court using the standards we have applied."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1989.337,2002.277,"Well Mr. Zingman, I didn’t understand you making the argument that your balancing test has even comes into play, unless or until we are dealing with confidential information, is that true?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2002.277,2002.792,That is correct.
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2002.792,2012.08,"And my brother Rehnquist’s question, as I understood it, the reporter is just an eyewitness to a murder, he is like anybody else as an eyewitness to a murder."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2019.247,2023.617,"I thank you Mr. Justice Stewart, I have misunderstood Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2023.617,2025.122,"Maybe I did also, but I --"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2025.122,2030.843,"I deal solely with confidentiality, yes sir."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.843,2038.904,"I think that you would’ve searched this privilege with respect to the name and the source, but also with respect to --"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2038.904,2039.629,Information.
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.629,2040.758,--to information.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2040.758,2041.597,Yes sir.
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.597,2079.208,"Now let’s assume a reporter gets items A to Z, and he promises not to disclose L to Z, but he may disclose A to L, and he does. Concededly however, L to Z are very newsworthy items that if he would free to publish them, and he says, ""I must have this privilege in order that I could publish A to L, but I must privileged to withhold this other very newsworthy information."""
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2090.763,2097.643,Our argument is that the judgment must be left to the newsman as to what he will publish or not publish.
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.643,2107.865,"And he may suppress newsworthy information in order to, publish some of it."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2107.865,2119.938,"He might withhold as a matter of news judgment, that some information that he’s acquired as a basis for publishing of it, yes, in response to your question."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.938,2125.531,"And also, he’s got the judgment as to when to publish?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2125.531,2127.178,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.178,2133.208,"I mean, even if he says, ""Well these items, the L to Z, I am going to publish sometime, but not now."""
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2133.208,2135.102,He could exercise that judgment.
1971.70-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.969,2245.267,"In the Palm case, the Kentucky Court of Appeals suggested that what your client witnessed was a felony, rather than a misdemeanor, do you disagree with that?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2245.267,2246.366,I don’t disagree with that.
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.776,2307.365,"Aren’t you saying at that point, perhaps I don’t follow you, that this is precisely the situation that is prevailed until recently when your newsman were able to get into some of these circles and uncover news that here before was not available?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2307.365,2316.222,"Well, I am saying that up to now, they have been able to get that information, but once this Court declares that there is no First Amendment right to protect that, they are not going to get the information, that’s what I’m saying."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.222,2320.316,"Awhile ago, I thought you said that up to now they hadn’t been able to get this information?"
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2320.316,2320.43,Oh!
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.771,2322.985,And that’s why --
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2322.985,2323.974,This case demonstrates --
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.974,2328.9,-- that it’s only recently that newsman has been able to get into this inner circle.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2328.9,2329.064,"No, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.064,2335.036,So I suggest that your parade of horribles and then he takes us back.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2335.036,2355.758,"I don’t believe it takes us back, because as a practical matter, the very fact that this issue has not gotten here before, I think is demonstration of the fact that prosecutors have not pressed newsmen, up until recent years, that accommodations have been worked out to protect confidential sources and such."
1971.70-85,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2538.519,2547.303,What was then which you mentioned essential to your submission or with in-camera proceedings be acceptable?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2547.303,2565.376,"Mr. Justice Powell, I don’t think in-camera proceedings would be acceptable, because the basis that the moment the newsman goes behind the closed door, that the suspicions of the kind that were referred to in the Caldwell case yesterday are generated and so we think it necessitates an open hearing."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2565.376,2567.153,And before whom should that hearing be?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2567.153,2568.875,Trial judge.
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2568.875,2584.338,"As well as the one of the traditional values of the grand jury we’ve always thought and certainly this Court has repeatedly said, is that it is not and should not be controlled by judges and by prosecutors, or by anybody else."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2591.553,2592.674,I agree with that.
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.674,2604.666,It was grand jury of citizens to act and to investigate without any limitations imposed upon it by officials has been thought to be one of his values --
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2604.666,2613.21,"I agree with that, but the traditional practice, for example as the record shows in this case, the petitioner was called before the trial judge."
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2618.967,2625.379,"Well, because the trial judge said, ""I am not going to interfere with the traditional freedom of a grand jury."""
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2625.756,2631.188,"Well, he said that by saying that, ""I don’t agree with you, that there’s a First or Fourteenth Amendment privilege."""
1971.70-85,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.237,2641.766,There may be even lawyers and judges have been saying this to each other for a good many centuries.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2641.766,2656.353,"Yes sir, and in my 20 some arguments of experience in the Courts of Kentucky, with that in any way testing any aspersions on my friend Mr. Schroering here, the myth does not fit the operations of grand juries in Kentucky."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.353,2658.694,Could I ask you just one question?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2665.849,2683.68,"We make some distinction with reference to trials, but in essence, the way we formulated the situation the same balancing test would be made."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.68,2692.765,Would you say the same privileges would be available to newsman by subpoenaing at an actual trial as he would have when he subpoenaed by the grand jury.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2692.765,2693.877,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.877,2696.115,And he didn’t even appear?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2696.115,2699.363,"Well, I think I’ve said he would not have to appear in a close proceeding."
1971.70-85,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.547,2704.531,But only the claim is privilege?
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2704.531,2712.751,"He would then assert his privilege not to respond to questions relating to confidential information, but certainly would have to appear."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2716.04,2723.893,"Mr. Zingman we’ve helped you consume your time, and it is used up that we’ll allow you a full five minutes for rebuttal."
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2723.893,2724.583,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2724.583,2726.488,We’ll adjust the other time accordingly.
1971.70-85,0,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,2726.488,2728.167,Thank you.
1971.70-85,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.167,2731.328,Mr. Schroering.
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2731.328,2736.159,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2776.207,2780.263,"Is your only brief this little 3, 4-page brief?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2780.263,2786.463,That’s correct Mr. Justice Douglas.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2786.463,2794.984,"Do you think that you say that there is nothing in the constitution, apart from the privilege of self-incrimination that protects the witness?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2794.984,2796.871,Yes.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2796.871,2817.104,"Suppose a man is on the stand, or let the State of Committee and asked him if he believes in Jesus Christ or God, or what his religion is, do you think that is subject to examination by Government group?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2817.104,2820.436,That of course would be a protection under the First Amendment.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2828.649,2834.415,What particular part in religion that do you believe in socialist?
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2834.415,2837.454,You mean as a general principle?
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2837.454,2840.949,"I mean, everything goes in these --"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2840.949,2841.675,No.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2841.675,2844.188,The State can compel everybody to do anything?
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2844.188,2844.538,No.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2844.538,2850.722,"What you tell the priest, what you tell your pastor, what you tell your wife, what you tell your doctor."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2853.821,2861.405,"A very interesting argument Mr. Justice Douglas, could be made to this Court on the protection of the First Amendment on a religious --"
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2861.405,2865.127,"No, I am just amazed on this little 3-page."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2867.751,2880.825,"I did not mean by writing a short brief, Mr. Justice Douglas, to give the impression that I was writing or thinking that this was a frivolous matter."
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2916.411,2918.838,You don’t cite any cases in your brief.
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2918.838,2922.551,Variety versus Lead (ph) is cited.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2928.21,2929.319,I see it.
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,2929.319,2946.546,"-- which holds that the press has no more rights under the constitution, than a citizen, and this is one of the questions which I believe has been directed to counsel in this case."
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3012.018,3020.063,"But the same State of Kentucky, through its judiciary said that statute just under (Inaudible)."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3020.063,3038.884,"The case decided in Branzburg v. Hayes, Mr. Justice Marshall, held that the protection does apply except in the instance of where the newsman is an actual witness to the crime."
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3049.446,3053.456,"But what do we have before us, that statute or the judgment in this case?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3058.422,3058.879,That’s correct.
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3058.879,3060.443,And it said that it doesn’t apply.
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3060.443,3061.179,That is correct it does not apply.
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.179,3063.393,So how do you make a case?
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3063.393,3091.339,"We raised this question in our brief as to just how this case arrived at the Supreme Court which was a matter of some concern to us in our brief, because the judge held in the Court below that the petitioner had abandoned his argument on the First Amendment, but we are here now --"
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.339,3099.751,"Nonetheless, I thought, in the last decision in your Court ruled specifically on the First and Fourteenth Amendment, and you said it didn’t apply."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3099.751,3100.346,That’s correct.
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3100.346,3102.372,And that’s the one that’s here.
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3102.372,3104.163,"No, there are two cases here Mr. Justice --"
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3104.163,3105.564,"Well, that was here."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3105.564,3109.016,There are two cases involved.
1971.70-85,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3142.211,3154.466,"Mr. Schroering, even in the Pound case, certainly the petitioners here, and their application to the Kentucky Court of Appeals raised the constitutional question, did they not?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3157.95,3184.589,"Yes, they mentioned that before Judge Pound as I recall, but then later on in argument before the Court, and if you will note in the Courts of Appeals decision involving Meigs, it specifically referred to, and I referred to the portion of the appendix where the Court claimed, that they abandoned this particular argument."
1971.70-85,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3184.589,3191.58,"So it is a contention of abandonment of an oral argument, although the claim was made in the written application to the Court?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3191.58,3195.499,That’s correct!
1971.70-85,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3287.364,3289.998,You mean of the --
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3289.998,3292.391,"Excuse me, on the prosecution, I’m very sorry."
1971.70-85,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3292.391,3295.464,"The grand jury often investigates the police, does it not?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3295.464,3296.574,"Often it does, and that --"
1971.70-85,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3296.574,3299.907,"Particularly, in certain counties of Kentucky, in our experience."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3299.907,3302.576,That’s correct.[Laughter]
1971.70-85,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3310.228,3315.49,"Is there a grand jury empanelled, you say every month in each county in Kentucky?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3315.49,3315.615,No.
1971.70-85,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3315.615,3316.629,Or did I not understand you?
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3316.629,3317.348,No.
1971.70-85,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3325.816,3327.272,How many counties in Kentucky?
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3327.272,3330.637,120.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3330.637,3339.778,"Does the prosecutor or the police in Kentucky use newspapermen as agents, or runners, or investigators?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3339.778,3350.625,"No, Mr. Justice Douglas, the prosecution does not use the news media for this purpose."
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3578.411,3584.211,"Well, our question implies, there is no privilege in this case."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3591.791,3596.889,"Only the Fifth Amendment would apply, that is our position for constitutional reason."
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3624.052,3628.406,"-- the law maybe, have you ever been to a Palestinian country?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3630.949,3633.439,"I have not Mr. Justice Douglas, been to Russia."
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3633.439,3637.581,-- oppressed or kind of oppressed that you have under a regiment society?
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3637.581,3652.828,"I would never want to have such a situation occur in this country, and I agree wholeheartedly with the statute which has been passed by the legislature of Kentucky granting to the press a privilege, a legislative Act."
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3684.899,3691.467,Then you made every reporter a runner for the government in every case?
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3691.467,3697.362,"If we assumed that that is a function of the grand jury, to be an arm of the government --"
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3697.362,3698.834,This doesn’t stop at grand jury.
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3718.79,3727.865,You mean that each of these agencies would thereby employ the press to do their job for them.
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3727.865,3736.645,"If he can be required to testify with this, I don’t see why it couldn’t be required to testify at the SEC or the federal trade."

1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3741.245,3743.975,-- that ends up (Laughter).
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3800.151,3816.323,"Well, this judgment has affirmed than every place in the country want a story of peace and oppressed, which shows confidential information concerning a crime."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3824.599,3826.233,Not necessarily.
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3826.233,3831.707,"Well, how would you say they’re so great, how could they be doing the job if they didn’t?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3831.707,3843.273,"If the newspaper reporters observed a crime, the commission of a crime, they become a witness and they have a duty, and a responsibility to testify in a Court of law."
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3843.273,3852.882,"Well then, wouldn’t it be too that once they publish the story, they volunteer as a witness?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3852.882,3856.863,They are subject to being subpoenaed before the Grand Jury.
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3856.863,3858.445,And wouldn’t they be subpoenaed?
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3858.445,3859.364,That’s correct.
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3881.496,3888.228,"Well I think, if I understand this case correctly, he did raise the privilege, and it was denied."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3888.228,3888.661,It was denied --
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3888.661,3904.709,"So then if I would to say further, that if we affirm this case, every time a reporter publishes a story of this type, he would be subpoenaed before the grand jury, will make his claim of privilege and it would be denied."
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3906.72,3913.498,Only if there is an indication that he is also a witness to the crime in Kentucky.
1971.70-85,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3913.498,3915.777,"Well, I am saying the case of this type."
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3915.777,3918.895,I didn’t think we were talking about a witness to a felony.
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3925.826,3926.877,He was told --
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3926.877,3931.815,"He’s not walking down the street and sees a bank being held up, that’s not this case, is it?"
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3931.815,3934.019,"No, but this case is one where --"
1971.70-85,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3934.019,3936.308,But he got confidential information.
1971.70-85,1,23170,edwin_a_schroering_jr,,3936.308,3961.557,"Confidential information and also the reporter witnessed the compounding of hashish, the combining together the elements of that drug which is a felony in Kentucky, and under the circumstances, there is an overriding, certainly an overriding need that these individuals be brought to justice under our law."

1971.70-85,3,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,5399.433,5402.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you."
1971.70-85,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5569.86,5573.182,"I think that’s been considerably eroded, has it not?"
1971.70-85,3,23468,edgar_a_zingman,,5573.182,5581.53,"Well, and I think if necessarily so, but its still is established and it’s a right that they urge --"
