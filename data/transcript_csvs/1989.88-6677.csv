1989.88-6677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.709,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-6677, Horace Butler v. Kenneth D. McKellar."
1989.88-6677,0,29334,john_h_blume,,12.099,14.742,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.199,135.463,But every... every decision of ours is... almost every decision of ours is within the logical compass of another decision.
1989.88-6677,0,29334,john_h_blume,,154.879,162.816,"The hard facts of Teague, of course, do involve a situation which would require overruling, and the language... however, of course, I think Teague must go beyond that."
1989.88-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.206,210.177,"What... let's consider the rationality, the reason we sought to draw the line."
1989.88-6677,0,29334,john_h_blume,,241.018,249.413,"I think the purpose underlying the rule is does the state have a legitimate, essentially reliance interest, in expecting that the decision will be different."
1989.88-6677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.326,412.898,"--Thank you, Mr. Blume."
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1556.033,1560.027,"Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-6677,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.993,1586.156,"It is true... it is true that if we accepted that argument, it would support the judgment below, would it?"
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1586.156,1589.798,"--Yes, but I think that it's discretionary certainly with this Court whether it entertain the merits."
1989.88-6677,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.558,1617.877,[inaudible]
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1617.877,1618.528,Pardon me?
1989.88-6677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.528,1624.993,"Your position covers both situations, whether the, they were the same or the different police officers."
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1624.993,1626.074,Yes.
1989.88-6677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.868,1641.825,"Counsel, what if the Petitioner had been released on the assault charge, and while it was still pending, say two weeks later, he was picked up for questioning on the charge now before us."
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1648.06,1652.692,I think the break in custody would again... I think it would depend on the facts of the case.
1989.88-6677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1667.684,1673.959,"Well, do you think police officers reasonably could rely on the fact that they could question him after giving him Miranda warning?"
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1673.959,1677.031,On an individual who had been released?
1989.88-6677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1677.031,1677.312,Yes.
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1677.312,1687.119,"I think it would depend, again, if the officers did it to avoid Edwards, that might be a source of some concern, and of course, that is not what happened here."
1989.88-6677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.119,1687.7,"Well, let me just up the ante."
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1697.129,1697.42,On different charges?
1989.88-6677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.42,1698.021,Yes.
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1698.021,1707.046,"Edwards does seem to be, and Roberson, concerned with the pressures inherent in custodial, inherent in custodial interrogation, and thus a break could make a difference."
1989.88-6677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.978,1708.138,All right.
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1715.745,1722.79,"I... that situation could still, I think, be within the logical compass of Edwards under some circumstances."
1989.88-6677,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1722.79,1727.675,"You would have to say that, it seems to me, consistently with the argument you made."
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1754.973,1766.271,"Well, of course in this case, I don't think you can say that the states had any right to rely on an unarticulated exception to Edwards, which is essentially the Attorney General's position in this case."
1989.88-6677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.271,1767.393,Articulated where?
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1767.393,1770.925,"Unarticulated, not articulated, exception, which is the Attorney General's argument."
1989.88-6677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.925,1782.263,"But wasn't it... I... hadn't there been a lot of cases, some cases that said that Edwards doesn't apply to interrogation on different charges?"
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1782.263,1783.185,"Yes, there had been."
1989.88-6677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.215,1822.967,"How do you go... how do you go about answering the Teague question, if you can't take... supposing the lower courts had lined up, you know, ten to two on this issue, saying that Edwards did not extend to the Roberson situation."
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1826.259,1838.297,"--I don't think, of course, this can be reduced to simple arithmetic, which side it acted... but more on, I think you would have to look behind it and say did the states have a legitimate reliance interest in relying on it."
1989.88-6677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.297,1840.39,But I'm not talking about state law enforcement people.
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1864.627,1869.291,"I don't think it should be disregarded, but I don't think that can be dispositive, because what that would--"
1989.88-6677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.291,1870.463,"So, it's a factor."
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1870.463,1873.755,"--It's a factor, yes, I believe it is a factor."
1989.88-6677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.755,1882.09,"xxx five to four as to whether this is, whether this is dictated by Edwards?"
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1884.25,1889.135,"Again, I think that question is answered implicitly in Yates."
1989.88-6677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.408,1910.873,"Well, didn't... wasn't... Teague talked about it being dictated by a prior decision, didn't it?"
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1910.873,1912.265,"Yes, the language of Teague--"
1989.88-6677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.265,1912.292,Dictated.
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1912.292,1912.833,--was dictated.
1989.88-6677,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.833,1926.412,"Dictated, which is quite different, as others have pointed out, between... it is different than logical parameters, or... your... your standard is much different from the Teague standard."
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1926.412,1931.447,"Well, Teague did not attempt to define the spectrum of what is or is not a new rule."
1989.88-6677,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.864,1957.594,Do you think Teague was a new rule?
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1957.594,1963.508,It certainly was a surprise to many of us.
1989.88-6677,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.669,1963.959,What is it?
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,1974.81,1988.49,"I think it has some statutory and some constitutional concerns, depending on the proceeding, but it is a rule which this Court... the retroactivity principle of this Court to determine when decisions apply to cases, final and direct review."
1989.88-6677,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.49,1991.223,You shouldn't be so surprised at that.
1989.88-6677,2,29334,john_h_blume,,2008.587,2011.339,"Yes, I think that is true."
1989.88-6677,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.82,2017.211,"Thank you, Mr. Blume."
