1990.89-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.728,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1632, California v. Hodari D.."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,57.95,58.591,"Niver, sir."
1990.89-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,58.591,61.582,"Mr. Niver, you may proceed."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,61.582,64.952,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1632,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,185.332,190.065,"Mr. Niver, the State conceded there was no articulable suspicion?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,190.065,199.191,"--We have never contested that, Your Honor, and the case comes to this Court based upon the premise, the assumption that there was no articulable suspicion."
1990.89-1632,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,199.662,199.992,Why--
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,203.495,210.418,"Well, because there was a finding by the trial court which was not contested in the trial court."
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.009,228.63,"Well, that there's no unreason... that there's no suspicion to stop as of what point?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,228.63,238.127,As of the point that the... at the point before respondent dropped his rock of cocaine.
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.549,243.6,In... all right.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,261.052,262.722,"Yes, Your Honor, it is some evidence."
1990.89-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.192,285.729,"Now, do you take the position that the police are free to chase somebody without any reasonable, articulable suspicion?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,285.729,293.363,We take the position that it does not violate the Fourth Amendment until that person has actually been restrained.
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,297.156,298.496,May I ask--
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,300.268,302.569,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.768,326.204,"May I ask, before you get into the definition of seizure, is it your view of the record that had he not thrown the cocaine, the rock or whatever it was, down, he would not have been stopped?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,326.204,328.054,"--Oh, he would have been stopped."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.054,328.735,He would have been seized?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,328.735,329.086,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,329.086,333.41,So that the question then is whether there's anything illegal about an attempted seizure?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,333.41,335.651,"That's exactly the case, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,335.651,339.682,Anything illegal about an attempted seizure without articulable suspicion.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,339.682,340.604,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.604,343.045,And is it not rather clear that that should be illegal?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,343.045,346.638,"Your Honor, our position is to the contrary."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,351.82,356.795,So the exclusionary rule should not apply to attempted illegal conduct by the police?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,356.795,359.837,"It does not violate... that's right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.272,383.433,"Well, it seems to me that you have to have... you certainly are going to defend... you're certainly going to say that the officer properly seized him when he finally did--"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,383.433,383.881,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.881,387.994,"--physically, and the reason is, I suppose, that he had thrown the rock away."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,387.994,389.376,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,389.376,394.189,"That gave... that gave some sort of reasonable suspicion to do something about it, or what?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,395.19,396.74,At that point it was probably probable cause.
1990.89-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.982,404.965,"Because otherwise the case is over, if you had no legal basis to actually seize him physically."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,404.965,408.398,At the time he seized him physically he had more than Terry suspicion.
1990.89-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.758,415.002,So you think it... you think the issue is whether there was a seizure prior to throwing the rock away?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,415.002,415.583,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,415.583,425.078,Is it not clear from what you have acknowledged that the reason he threw the rock away is that the police were in the act of attempting to conduct an illegal seizure?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,428.7,432.083,"He was prompted... Your Honor, yes, Your Honor... no, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,433.125,434.123,Why do you think he threw it away?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,434.123,438.107,"--We will never know, because the record does not articulate it."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.25,447.834,"Who was in an illegal attempt to try and seize him at the very moment, was he not?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,449.083,454.099,We have never acknowledged that at that point there was a show of authority.
1990.89-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.699,478.124,"Mr. Niver, is there anything in the record about factually why this particular respondent threw the... the block or brick away at the time he did?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,478.124,479.574,"Nothing at all, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.574,485.668,So it's just really speculation or guessing from what the record shows about the series of events?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,485.668,486.93,"Entirely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.93,494.444,Is it anything more than guessing whether they would have arrested him if he hadn't thrown it away?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,494.444,501.69,The officer testified that he wanted to stop him and question him about why he ran away.
1990.89-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.752,506.682,A Terry stop or an arrest?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,506.682,507.614,--A Terry stop.
1990.89-1632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,511.064,516.058,Is there anything in the record to show whether he was a purchaser or a seller?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,516.058,517.799,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,527.306,530.968,So there's nothing in the record to show that he might have been the purchaser?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,530.968,532.579,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.579,537.922,"Mr. Niver, you make a point of the fact it would have been just a Terry stop rather than an arrest."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,541.646,543.796,"It would... yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.796,546.738,So it would have been equally illegal as an arrest.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,546.738,550.57,It would have violated the Fourth Amendment to detain him--
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.57,552.591,Just as much as a Terry... just as much as an arrest would.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,552.591,553.202,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,553.202,554.684,After the running began?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,554.684,565.2,"After the running began, the running by itself, the court of appeal found, was not sufficient to detain him."
1990.89-1632,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,568.182,574.657,"Mr. Niver, what about... well, there were other drugs admitted in evidence, were there not?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,574.657,578.988,"They were... there is... no, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,704.301,709.936,"What if the police officer fired a couple of warning shots, and the fellow still ran and then threw the rock away?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,709.936,716.579,"If he ran and escaped apprehension, he has not been seized."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.579,718.219,So that even shooting at him wouldn't be enough?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,718.219,720.341,"It would be a display of authority, certainly."
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,724.784,731.87,"In your view, when the police office puts on red lights behind a car, when does the stop take place?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,735.961,737.633,When the car pulls over to the curb--
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.633,743.878,"And if there is no basis for the stop, suppose the car pulls away at a high speed?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,743.878,746.57,--Then the seizure has terminated.
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,746.57,761.997,"Can the police officer acquire a basis for stopping the car after it pulls away at a high speed, if he had no basis to turn on the lights to begin with?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,761.997,764.15,"I'm not sure I understand, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,764.15,768.573,"Suppose the police officer has no basis for turning on the red lights, but does so anyway."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,768.573,768.983,Yes.
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.983,771.794,The car then pulls away at a high speed.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,775.227,782.682,"I would say that if there are other circumstances present, certainly."
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,782.682,784.705,Just the circumstances I give.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,784.705,788.195,"A high-speed chase, I would suggest--"
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,788.195,789.116,"Well, let's forget high speed."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,789.116,789.357,--All right.
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,789.357,792.159,Suppose he pulled... ignores the lights and continues?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,792.159,794.118,"I would think so, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,795.269,798.983,You think there would be basis for a reasonable suspicion at that point?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,798.983,801.524,"At that point, yes, Your Honor, I do."
1990.89-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.524,804.647,And I suppose in one example--
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,813.342,814.762,A high speed that is suggesting--
1990.89-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.762,815.203,Within the speed limit?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,815.203,820.726,--Something... either speeding or something suspicious about the circumstances of leaving.
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.622,967.313,Let me give you a hypothetical.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,984.164,985.195,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.195,985.816,Why?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,996.553,999.544,"At the... well, he was ordered to drop his weapon."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.544,999.985,Right.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,999.985,1004.316,His act in dropping the weapon was a submission to the officer's authority.
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.316,1007.749,And so... does that mean there was a seizure or was there not a seizure?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1007.749,1011.542,A seizure... there was a seizure of the person and there was a seizure of his weapon.
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1011.542,1012.521,Even though he never caught him?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1013.853,1019.617,The seizure ended when he ran away and was not... when he ran from the control of the officer.
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1019.617,1023.23,"But he was never under the control of the officer, under your argument as I understand it."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1023.23,1029.123,Our argument is that if a person submits to a show of... submits to a show of authority--
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.123,1029.614,I see.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1029.614,1031.174,--at that point he is seized.
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.204,1056.081,"So if this man understood the chase to be a show of authority where he was attempting to catch him, then it would be a seizure and it would have been an illegal seizure?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1058.533,1065.538,"In this case... if I understand Your Honor's question, in this case it was not a submission because he attempted to run."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.538,1070.07,"Well, my fellow threw the gun on the ground and then ran, and he never got caught."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1070.07,1071.482,"He was ordered to do so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.482,1079.045,So the thing that's wrong here is there is no... nothing equivalent to an order to stop or an order to throw the rock away?
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1079.045,1080.906,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1080.906,1099.689,"Mr. Niver, you're saying, if I understand it, that there's no Fourth Amendment violation when the police obtain evidence as a result of unlawful conduct by them, unless that unlawful conduct constitutes a completed seizure?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1100.751,1105.954,Or unless the police officer has ordered the person to--
1990.89-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1105.954,1111.156,"Yeah, but that in your view would amount to a seizure, because it would be a submission to authority, right?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1111.156,1112.148,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1112.148,1112.428,Okay.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1112.839,1113.608,It's very much... it's--
1990.89-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1113.608,1124.396,"--All right, would your... would your position be different if instead of raising the issue under the Fourth Amendment, the issue had been raised under the Due Process Clause, pure and simple?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1124.396,1128.427,--If the respondent had argued--
1990.89-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1128.427,1136.354,Somebody says there's a violation of due process in obtaining evidence as a result of unlawful police conduct and using that evidence in trial.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1136.354,1141.797,"--Well, I believe that this Court has not so held since Roshan."
1990.89-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1154.765,1168.335,"So that for evidentiary purposes, illegal police conduct is really not subject to regulation unless you do have a narrow or strict Fourth Amendment violation?"
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1168.335,1177.879,"Well, not all intrusive police conduct violates the Constitution, and if it does violate the Constitution, it does not necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment."
1990.89-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1195.192,1196.582,I understand your point on that.
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1221.729,1222.288,--There is already--
1990.89-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.288,1226.693,"You're free to answer the question, Mr. Niver."
1990.89-1632,0,40076,ronald_e_niver,,1226.693,1236.039,"--There is already in place an exclusionary rule which advises the officer that if he chases him and if he seizes him and if he searches him, that evidence will be excluded."
1990.89-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.908,1238.741,"Thank you, Mr. Niver."
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1241.253,1249.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.256,1302.641,"But Mr. Sloan, is that any more anomalous than the hypothetical I gave and the answer counsel gave of pulling the gun on the man and say drop your weapon, and then he runs away and he never gets caught?"
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1304.513,1307.754,"--Well, if I could ask for one point of clarification in your hypothetical, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.108,1313.32,He's running the entire time.
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1313.32,1316.131,"If he's running the entire time, I think there is not a seizure of the person."
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1330.009,1333.983,Did I understand you to say the procedure was taking place?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1341.717,1345.17,"I... no, I did not say that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1355.165,1357.208,"Well, what was going on during the running?"
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1357.208,1364.561,"--Well, what the record reveals is that Officer Pertoso was running up a street in one direction, respondent was running--"
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1364.561,1367.203,Did he tell him he was an officer of the law?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1367.203,1368.194,"--No, he did not."
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1368.194,1370.155,"Well, how did the man know it?"
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1370.155,1374.96,"Well, what is revealed in the record is that he had a jacket that said Police on it."
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1377.09,1379.571,And while the man was running he could look back and see the jacket?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1379.571,1380.272,"Well, apparently--"
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1380.272,1382.494,He's got eyes in the back of his head?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1382.494,1392.0,"--No, Your Honor, but the evidence is that he saw the car with the individuals in it as he stood there before he ran."
1990.89-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.0,1395.443,I thought he was running towards the officer anyway?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1395.443,1404.649,He was running towards the officer at the time of the event that the actual seizure... that the throwing away of the rock of cocaine took place and the eventual seizure.
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.453,1410.974,But I thought--
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1425.783,1434.019,"Well, we entirely agree, Justice Marshall, that when he saw him throw away the rock of cocaine, that furnished probable cause for the... for the arrest."
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1436.179,1440.671,"Well, why do you have to find out whether he was under arrest before then?"
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1440.671,1449.857,"Well, in our view it's quite clear that there was not a seizure before then, and that was in fact the fallacy in the court of appeals' opinion, was that they thought that it was critical--"
1990.89-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1449.857,1452.929,"I think you just want to confuse us, that's all."
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1458.602,1460.545,"--It was, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1460.545,1466.84,And there's no evidence that the defendant understood it was a police vehicle or police in it?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1466.84,1474.774,"Well, what the evidence is that's in the record, and it's the testimony of the two officers at the suppression hearing, is that they did... they had jackets on that said Police."
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.513,1511.938,But is it correct there's no evidence that they knew whether they were police officers or... or perhaps rival distributors of illegal substances who might have been after them?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1517.732,1520.453,It is... it is possible.
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.395,1527.198,"Well, for example, had the officers got out of the car before they started to run?"
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1527.198,1529.88,--No.
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.3,1532.771,"So they wouldn't have been able to see what was on their jackets, would they?"
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1532.771,1534.503,--That's probably correct.
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1556.647,1556.837,Yes.
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1556.837,1558.628,--which is not presented in this case.
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.052,1583.725,"But Mr. Sloan, in my other hypothetical you said you wanted to ask if the fellow was running."
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1592.941,1600.376,"--If, when he was standing there, an objective observer would say that he had manifested acquiescence--"
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.376,1602.937,"Well, he threw his gun on the ground pursuant to the command--"
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1602.937,1604.559,"--Well, I don't think that the throwing--"
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.559,1604.759,--and then ran.
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1604.759,1609.661,--I think that the throwing of the object is distinct from the question of the seizure of the person.
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.933,1612.153,Right.
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1612.153,1613.845,There is clearly a seizure of the gun in that instance.
1990.89-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.672,1628.065,"No, my facts are he just threw the gun on the ground and ran, and was never caught."
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1628.065,1641.572,"--Well, in those... under those facts I do not think that it would be a seizure, because I don't think that there is anything, aside from the throwing down of the gun, that manifests acquiescence in the coercive assertion of authority for the seizure of the person."
1990.89-1632,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.788,1651.81,Suppose he does acquiesce in the authority.
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1662.156,1666.349,"In that circumstance there, there has been a seizure."
1990.89-1632,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1692.576,1694.997,And so what is the result with reference to the gun?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1694.997,1707.276,"Well, with reference to the gun it would be our position that it is not a fruit of the unlawful seizure, because the decision to throw down the gun in that circumstance is a sufficient intervening independent act of free will."
1990.89-1632,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.276,1708.467,Can you argue that here?
1990.89-1632,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1708.467,1710.769,"Yes, we can, and we do."
1990.89-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.372,1826.975,"Thank you, Mr. Sloan."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,1829.466,1835.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1904.034,1909.448,Does the record show that he... that Hodari knew that Officer Pertoso was a police officer?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,1909.448,1914.051,"--The record does not reflect what Hodari knew, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1632,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1914.051,1915.443,There isn't any testimony about that?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,1915.443,1915.603,No.
1990.89-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.049,1944.351,"When you say bearing down, actually they were running towards one another, weren't they?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,1944.351,1949.754,"Officer Pertoso was running directly at Hodari, blocking his path."
1990.89-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.754,1956.469,"And Hodari had looked over his shoulder, and then he turned, and 11 feet away he saw Pertoso?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,1956.469,1958.7,"Bearing right down on him, blocking his path, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.7,1959.772,Yeah.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,1967.896,1974.712,"Justice O'Connor, in the manner in which Officer Pertoso was bearing down on Hodari, yes, I do."
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1974.712,1977.073,"Well, I thought we didn't have any evidence about the manner."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,1982.746,1983.387,My recollection--
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1983.387,1984.787,Do we have other evidence?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,1984.787,1990.61,"--My recollection of the record, Your Honor, is Officer Pertoso says he was running directly at Hodari."
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1995.974,2012.927,"Well, do you think that if a police officer is running down the sidewalk towards someone, and there is a jogger running in the opposite direction toward the police officer, that that alone constitutes a seizure?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2012.927,2021.843,"Justice O'Connor, I do not believe that constitutes a seizure, because I think what's required here is intimidating and coercive conduct on the part of the police officer."
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2022.283,2024.735,But we don't have any evidence of that.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2033.921,2034.392,--Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2041.927,2044.67,"Well, but we make an objective inquiry."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2056.688,2066.473,"--Justice O'Connor, I believe on the facts of this case and in this 11-foot scenario here, where the officer is bearing down on him, that was a sufficient blocking of his path to constitute a seizure."
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2079.331,2087.476,"Now if the defendant just keeps running, when does the seizure end, do you suppose?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2090.538,2090.858,Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2090.858,2095.362,"--when, when the defendant sees the policeman running towards him."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2099.754,2100.776,"Well, if the--"
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2100.776,2101.517,And isn't caught.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2101.517,2104.567,--If he escapes from the officer--
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2104.567,2104.767,Um-hum.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2104.767,2107.131,"--then the seizure would end at that point, when he--"
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2107.131,2107.589,What point?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2107.589,2108.76,--When he manages--
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2108.76,2109.532,When does he escape?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2109.532,2110.353,--to get away from the police officer.
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2110.353,2119.477,It seems to me it leaves a lot of unanswered questions there on the back end of your position.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2119.477,2127.563,"Well, I think in this case the officer would have of tackled... would have tackled Hodari if Hodari hadn't submitted to his authority."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.563,2128.082,Did he submit?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2130.526,2136.84,"He... Justice Scalia, Officer Pertoso testified that Hodari continued right towards him."
1990.89-1632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.563,2143.132,So that they just run into each other did they?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2146.477,2149.88,"--I think they probably skidded to a stop, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.88,2152.22,"Mr. Lozenski, they must have been running awfully slowly."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2160.196,2160.677,Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.677,2169.191,"And he, and he still has time to throw away the rock of cocaine and somehow to stop from colliding with him?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2172.253,2172.683,Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.683,2174.263,It must be a misprint.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2197.96,2202.394,"No, I don't think that is a correct analysis."
1990.89-1632,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2203.803,2211.179,"Well, under your analysis you... Mr. Hodari should have said, Mr. Police Officer, under the Fourteenth Amendment you have made a mistake."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2218.993,2219.484,--No.
1990.89-1632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.334,2222.426,"Well, that's what he's claiming."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2222.426,2228.12,Whatever Hodari did was a direct consequence of that officer bearing down on him.
1990.89-1632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.472,2237.146,So you're arguing for this position that Justice Kennedy just stated right now.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2237.146,2248.853,"--Well, maybe if Justice Kennedy would ask his question again, or propose his hypothetical... there's another element here."
1990.89-1632,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2248.853,2267.576,"You're arguing that the police, by beginning to chase, have automatically granted immunity from introducing the evidence, because he either... one, he can run away and be successful, or two, he can go to the officer and say you have made a mistake, here's the cocaine but you can't introduce it."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2267.576,2270.499,"Well, I don't think either one of those is the case."
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2294.902,2304.649,"Well, do you take the position that the word ""seizure"" in the Fourth Amendment includes attempted seizure?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2304.649,2307.882,"No, I don't believe that is the case at all."
1990.89-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2314.577,2318.441,What makes it a seizure?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2341.694,2345.836,"Well, there may be a seizure, but if the person keeps running then the seizure stops."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.119,2382.43,But I thought we have said otherwise.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2391.377,2412.491,"If, from the totality of the circumstances, if you apply the reasonable person test, if a reasonable person would feel, in that person's... in the person who goes around the roadblock's position, would... if a reasonable person would view that as a--"
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2412.491,2414.111,"An attempt to stop him, he would."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2425.658,2427.92,"--No, I don't believe attempted seizure is a seizure."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.605,2437.547,But that... doesn't that depend on whether the person stops or not?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2442.141,2446.693,"No, I believe that there can be a seizure without an actual stopping of the person."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.324,2454.378,He's still seized while he's running?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2455.919,2459.942,"Well, if he escapes from the police officer he is no longer seized, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.508,2476.923,"And that, that... you see a scenario, policeman running down the street and the suspect running ahead of him, and the policeman shouting stop, stop, thief."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2478.903,2479.114,Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.114,2480.954,--Even while he's running he is seized?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2480.954,2481.575,Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.575,2483.816,Well--
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2488.791,2489.719,Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.703,2495.045,How do we determine when it terminated?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2495.045,2498.735,When he gets away from the officer.
1990.89-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2498.735,2502.178,"A certain number of feet, or something like that?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2502.178,2506.582,"When the officer lose sights... Mr. Chief Justice, when the officer lose sight... loses sight of him."
1990.89-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2506.582,2507.361,Looses sight?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2507.361,2507.891,Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2507.891,2517.899,"But if he drops the cocaine when the officer might have had some hope of catching him, then there's a seizure and that can't be introduced if you later find him 3 weeks later and try him and arrest him?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2517.899,2519.041,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.041,2525.483,"Mr. Lozenski, can I clear up something on the facts, especially about this 11 feet?"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2539.922,2541.475,Hodari was looking over his shoulder.
1990.89-1632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.082,2556.374,"No, he said it's just about the same."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2560.847,2561.538,And the judge--
1990.89-1632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.538,2564.549,But he did not say how far he was when he turned around and saw him.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2568.673,2574.025,"--Well, I think when Hodari turned around and saw the officer, the abandonment of the contraband was simultaneous with the sighting of the officer."
1990.89-1632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.025,2575.407,The testimony doesn't say that.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2575.407,2591.187,"This Court has held that, in Terry v. Ohio, that a police officer may not restrain the freedom of a citizen unless they have a reasonable basis for doing so."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.864,2698.878,"Well, we might say you'll need both."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2721.392,2726.115,"The show of authority, a submission to the show of authority is fine, Your Honor."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.843,2742.275,"Well, I understand you object to it."
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2750.811,2761.597,"Well, in Chesternut it was... it is my understanding that this Court eschewed bright line rules."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.688,2808.61,What do you think about the opinion in Brower?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2808.61,2813.523,"--Well, I think Brower is distinguishable from the facts of this case here."
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.286,2820.986,There was a car instead of a foot chase.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2826.509,2827.01,--Yes.
1990.89-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.958,2887.662,It wouldn't be overruling Chesternut.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,2908.933,2915.158,Maybe supplementing or refuting part of Chesternut with this rule in Brower.
1990.89-1632,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3151.866,3154.167,Where is Hodari now?
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,3154.167,3157.92,"Hodari is 19 years old, Justice Blackmun."
1990.89-1632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.139,3286.293,You don't necessarily win if we don't abandon the Chesternut rule.
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,3286.293,3289.955,Well--
1990.89-1632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.955,3292.777,"I know you think you do, but--"
1990.89-1632,2,31485,james_l_lozenski,,3292.777,3298.11,"--I have no response to that, Justice White."
1990.89-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.11,3299.683,Very well.
