2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.589,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-455, United States versus Ressam."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,9.086,39.967,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether a panel of the Ninth Circuit was correct when it added the words 844 of Title 18, and we think for at least four reasons, the answer to that question is no."
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,90.868,98.175,"Your argument relies on the notion that the word ""during"" in the statute is solely temporal."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,99.754,100.737,--Correct.
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,100.737,103.97,So... that's not always the case.
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,118.62,120.761,"In that instance, that would be correct."
2007.07-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.942,154.667,"General, could... could Congress pass a law that said if you wear a wristwatch during the commission of any crime, you get another ten years?"
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,154.667,162.692,A statute like that would be entirely unreasonable.
2007.07-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.753,174.984,Surely it depends on what the felony is.
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,225.072,225.622,It would.
2007.07-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.853,235.43,"That's perfectly lawful, and you get another 10 years for it just because you're... you're mailing a letter to the IRS at the same time."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,235.43,236.631,--It is perfectly lawful.
2007.07-455,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,272.897,299.857,"General Mukasey, is there any indication why this prosecutor chose to hook the carrying an explosive onto a false-statement charge, instead of some charges with which it would have been more logically linked, like the one... the first one, conspiracy to commit an act of terror... terrorism?"
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,299.857,300.871,There is.
2007.07-455,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.888,393.032,"I guess what's troubling me, Mr. Attorney General, is that it... it does seem to me fair enough to make that charge in this case; but then we... but then we have the tremendous number of cases where the prosecutor is going to be in the position in a plea-bargain context, say, to threaten to charge this offense with a heavy mandatory minimum."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,420.707,427.909,"The safeguard... the safeguard that is in the system, in part, involves the history of the system."
2007.07-455,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.422,480.826,"General, that is... my question would be the converse."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,519.326,527.511,"--We don't, but, respectfully, ""relationship"" doesn't mean in a statute what ""relationship"" means in conversation."
2007.07-455,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,532.678,533.212,Fine.
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,556.64,562.809,--It was... his carrying of explosives did not facilitate his lying in this case.
2007.07-455,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,562.809,565.262,"No, it didn't facilitate it, but it caused it."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,565.262,568.807,"Maybe it caused it, and maybe it didn't."
2007.07-455,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.807,570.664,"Well, if it didn't... all right."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,586.564,588.327,"No, Your Honor, we would not."
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,622.315,630.422,Why is there in the statutes a difference between possession of explosives in this circumstance and possession of firearms?
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,630.422,638.557,Possession of explosives inherently involves volatility.
2007.07-455,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,662.675,678.278,"Was... was the further explanation that what they were doing in amending the firearms statute was tailoring it more precisely to the possible felony by a police officer situation, and they simply did not face that possibility in the explosives statute?"
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,678.278,681.62,I think the history of the amendments to 924(c) reflects that.
2007.07-455,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,681.62,682.384,Yes.
2007.07-455,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.384,685.539,So it's a difference in two respects.
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,699.627,709.984,"Yes, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg; and that underlines, I think, the dangerousness, or Congress's perception of the dangerousness, and the volatility of explosives."
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,712.106,713.529,Is there any--
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,713.529,714.761,--this case bears that out.
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,714.761,726.772,--Is there any policy limitation within the department not to charge under this provision unless there is a relationship between the underlying felony and the use of... the carrying of explosives?
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,726.772,729.146,There is no policy limitation that I'm aware of.
2007.07-455,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.146,733.849,And you do have policy guidelines with money laundering.
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,733.849,734.987,We do.
2007.07-455,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,734.987,742.109,"And I suppose if you thought there was a problem, you could promulgate them out of your department."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,742.109,744.842,I think I'd be ideally suited to do that.
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,745.735,754.528,"The ten years, though, is mandatory, correct?"
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,754.528,756.135,The ten years is mandatory.
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,756.135,763.197,"So if a prosecutor asks for it and there is an underlying felony and there is an explosive, that's an additional ten years, no matter what."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,763.197,765.162,"That's an additional ten years, no matter what."
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,765.162,777.406,"So if you get... the underlying felony is of the sort Justice Scalia was talking about, and let's say the person gets probation on that because, you know, it is the first offense, no harm, he still gets ten years."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,777.406,779.89,He still gets ten years.
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,806.022,814.176,"Well, but how many cases are there likely to be... this isn't one of them... where you have no ""in relation to"" connection whatsoever?"
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,814.176,818.671,How many cases as a matter of common sense?
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,818.671,822.859,Or any historical record that you're familiar with.
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,822.859,828.186,"No historical record that I'm familiar with, but I don't have complete knowledge of the historical record."
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,828.186,833.088,"I mean, in this case, as you point out, there was, of course, a connection."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,854.017,858.002,I don't think... I'm not aware of any other situation in which it has arisen.
2007.07-455,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.921,866.12,This isn't a very good case.
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,873.51,879.851,"I think... I think the lessons we learned, particularly about the history, is that we don't want to bring absurd cases, and... and we don't."
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,879.851,892.895,"But I mean the interesting thing is that you're... the cases where this is going to arise is not where you're really worried about the explosives; it's going to... because in that case, presumably there is going to be a relation, and you can use it as you used it in this case."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,898.28,898.841,That--
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,898.841,909.775,"You know, the guy who's driving in his car and calls his broker and is guilty of insider trading and has some firecrackers in the trunk, you're not worried about the firecrackers, but you want to crack down on the insider trading."
2007.07-455,0,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,909.775,927.675,"--That has to do more with the breadth of the definition of ""explosives"" than it has to do with the question of a relationship, because we may very well be concerned with the person who is committing what sounds like an innocuous felony but carrying a load of explosives in his trunk."
2007.07-455,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,956.647,958.663,"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,965.036,976.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: General Mukasey put his finger on the point here when he said we wanted to charge a lead-pipe cinch case."
2007.07-455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.67,1090.698,"You're saying it should have said ""during which""?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1090.698,1092.527,"Well, I--"
2007.07-455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.527,1095.214,"""During the commission of which the explosive was used or carried? """
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1095.214,1105.426,"--I just think that the words... the words that were used, Your Honor, establish the notion of a relationship between the felony and the explosive."
2007.07-455,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1118.829,1128.652,"Well, but just... just as ""during"" has more than temporal... can have more than temporal significance, I think ""in"" can have temporal significance."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1128.652,1130.029,"It does, Your Honor."
2007.07-455,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1130.029,1131.682,"We write ""in the holiday season""."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1131.682,1132.574,That's very true.
2007.07-455,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1144.303,1151.206,"I assume... I haven't looked at the dictionary... but ""during's"" first relationship... first definition, I suspect, is temporal."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1151.206,1151.845,--It's temporal.
2007.07-455,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1152.766,1160.249,"Could you give an example of where it's not temporal, an example of use of ""during"" that is not temporal?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1160.249,1166.341,"I think the example posed by the Chief Justice to General Mukasey is an example of that, Your Honor."
2007.07-455,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1166.341,1173.336,"But hanging up lights ""during"" the... the holiday season doesn't... that's not a temporal relationship?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1173.336,1183.147,"It's a... it is a temporal relationship, but it's a relationship between the act that's occurring also, that's the underlying act."
2007.07-455,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1207.933,1220.817,"Mr. Hillier, I... you know, I will accept maybe more than just for the sake of argument that if you stick to the text alone you've got an argument here for some uncertainty, for some ambiguity."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1272.718,1273.67,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-455,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1308.843,1329.914,"The different object... I mean, the trouble with the different object argument is, as the Attorney General said, there was an evident concern in amending the handgun statute not to sweep in the rogue police officer who happens to have a gun on him when he does something that in fact is unlawful."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1329.914,1330.604,--Right.
2007.07-455,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1330.604,1346.72,"The negative inference from that is that there was an intent in the cognate explosives statute to sweep in people, whether in fact it was in relation to or not in relation to."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1346.72,1348.502,"Your Honor, I think that--"
2007.07-455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.502,1352.983,"Including the policeman who had cartridges in his gun, presumably, right?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1352.983,1370.32,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the... when you're looking at what happened to 844, when ""unlawfully"" was taken out the words ""in which"" were added, which I think indicates that Congress had an appreciation of the relationship that's involved in that statute."
2007.07-455,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1412.022,1413.975,"Okay, fair enough so far as the argument goes."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1426.688,1439.56,"Well, the... I think we go to yet another statutory construction tool, or at least observation by this Court that said the Congress can use different words in different statutes to accomplish the same thing."
2007.07-455,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.56,1441.478,"It can do it, but why would it have done so?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1454.788,1460.598,"Well, Your Honor, we don't know it didn't do that because the legislative history doesn't inform us."
2007.07-455,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1509.2,1516.012,And maybe they said... maybe because they're trying to draft legislation without using pronouns.
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1517.385,1521.071,"Touche, Your Honor."
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1522.244,1535.347,"I take it that one of the reasons you make your argument is so that if you prevail and you go back to trial, you would argue that this is not in relation to?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1537.691,1540.58,"Your Honor, perhaps I didn't understand your question."
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1541.391,1547.218,"If you prevail in this case and we say ""in relation to"" is part of the statute--"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1547.218,1547.936,Yes.
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1547.936,1554.384,"--and then you go back to the trial court, I assume you will argue to the jury that the government can't show that it's in relation to."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1554.384,1560.525,"Well, Your Honor, if you agree that there's a... if you agree with the Ninth Circuit in this case, then the case is over."
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1560.525,1561.508,That's right.
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1561.508,1562.694,The government--
2007.07-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1562.694,1564.383,Why should we agree with that?
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.383,1575.033,"But it seems to me that in a prosecution, in this prosecution, it might be somewhat difficult to establish in relation to."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1575.033,1578.222,--It would be difficult--
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1578.222,1581.315,"And that would be... even assuming the jury was properly instructed, et cetera, et cetera."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1581.315,1581.674,--Right.
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1586.591,1593.356,"All right, but doesn't that show the necessity for the very interpretation the attorney general has argued for here?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1597.165,1601.006,"--Your Honor, if we can look at the facts of this case, I would respectfully disagree."
2007.07-455,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1620.002,1628.936,"Well, if there's an ""in relationship"" requirement, why would it be necessary for the explosives to facilitate the false statement?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1636.429,1638.508,We have a reverse sort of relationship.
2007.07-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1677.569,1679.788,That's exactly what's bothering me.
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1719.836,1724.27,"Your Honor, I can't say too much more than what I have."
2007.07-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1725.881,1726.271,All right.
2007.07-455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.878,1729.628,You could say it is not a question on which we grant certiorari.
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1729.628,1730.237,"--Well, that's...--"
2007.07-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1731.329,1734.456,"--That may be, but I don't know... but you could say that."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1740.688,1741.249,"Yes, sir."
2007.07-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1741.249,1742.606,So what should I do--
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1742.606,1743.265,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.07-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1743.265,1751.291,--if I think that shooting the policeman because he's going to catch the criminal filled with explosives is within this statute?
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1777.046,1802.599,"--Well, Your Honor, the relationship... if you look at the structure of the statute, surely (h)(1) does not describe that sort of relationship; (h)(2) is the next statute or the next subsection of that statute, and its purpose is simply to capture the same criminal objective here, that is to say, the marriage of explosives and a felony."
2007.07-455,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.599,1803.957,I understand that argument.
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1809.424,1828.773,"I would ask the Court... well, I would think the Court would draw some... an answer from Smith which did describe a relationship contrary to the way Your Honor is doing with respect to this case that goes back to... goes... wasn't instructed that way; and so it can't be... this case still has to go back."
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.773,1843.705,"You think on this evidence, on this record, that a jury, if it were instructed to... that it had to find ""in relation to"" could return a conviction of guilty including the ""in relation to""?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1843.705,1847.783,If this case had been instructed correctly?
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1847.783,1855.154,"If this case had been instructed according to your theory of the statute and on this record and on this evidence, could a jury find your client guilty?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1855.154,1856.843,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-455,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1856.843,1859.279,That's exactly why the attorney general says he needs it.
2007.07-455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.279,1862.73,"Yes, you got it anyway."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1862.73,1863.744,"Beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
2007.07-455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.744,1866.9,"Could I ask you about the ""in which"", the ""in which"" thing?"
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1907.242,1917.741,"Well, Your Honor, the ""in which""... the point obviously was that it strengthens and informs the relationship here to be more than the coincidental or temporal one the government--"
2007.07-455,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.741,1924.019,"If you are being very precise, but whoever wrote that was, obviously, not being very precise because he left out ""fire"" entirely."
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1924.019,1941.275,--I suppose that goes to the idea that we shouldn't draw a lot of information from the amendments that were occurring on 924 when they weren't even looking at this statute and considering it and its consequences to the changes in 844... or having effect in 844.
2007.07-455,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2033.489,2039.186,Your friend indicated that this issue doesn't come up very often as a practical matter.
2007.07-455,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2040.735,2046.124,"Well, Your Honor... no, I don't disagree with that, and I'm not sure why that is."
2007.07-455,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2058.601,2060.649,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-455,2,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,2063.726,2067.427,I just wanted to make two brief points on rebuttal.
2007.07-455,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.018,2116.717,And maybe gunpowder doesn't include the little bit that's in a cartridge either.
2007.07-455,2,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,2122.138,2123.635,I think it does.
2007.07-455,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2123.635,2131.165,"Counsel, could I ask you, do you have an answer to your friend's point about the ""in which"" language?"
2007.07-455,2,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,2131.165,2140.786,"The ""in which"" simply includes both, number one, the use... the actual use and, number two, the carrying."
2007.07-455,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2152.78,2168.538,"I understood his point to be that it's surprising that they refer to use of the explosives or carrying of the explosives with reference to the underlying felony, ""in which"" the... suggests that the explosive was used or carried with respect to the underlying felony."
2007.07-455,2,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,2171.462,2175.07,"No, I think it suggests simply that the underlying felony was, in fact, committed."
2007.07-455,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.07,2183.847,"Well, it was going to be... it was going to be inaccurate as to one or the other of one or two."
2007.07-455,2,36312,michael_b_mukasey,,2202.058,2205.509,If there are no further questions--
2007.07-455,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2205.509,2206.851,"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General."
