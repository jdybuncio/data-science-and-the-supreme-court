1971.70-66,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.032,"We will hear arguments next in number 66, Roudebush against Hartke and 67."
1971.70-66,0,21495,donald_a_schabel,,36.962,39.737,May I please the Court.
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,972.043,974.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may I please the Court."
1971.70-66,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1031.396,1043.286,"I just imagine that, I gather there is no question nor complaints that a recount proceeding in your Circuit or Superior whatever the Court is, is a State Court proceedings for purposes one of two?"
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1043.286,1060.188,"That is an issue, Mr. Justice Brennan and the Appellant claims that since a State Court proceeding namely recount is administerial in a non adversary proceeding that is it not a State Court proceeding within the meaning of 2283."
1971.70-66,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1060.188,1067.172,"Well, are the Commissioners appointed much like special masters are appointed by a Court historically?"
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1067.172,1067.958,Yes.
1971.70-66,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1068.353,1073.985,And the Indiana Statute provides for the appointment of these Officers?
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1073.985,1076.323,These Officers are Officers of the Court.
1971.70-66,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1107.176,1118.794,"I suppose the appointment of these Commissioners are Special Officers as an alternative to having the State Court Judges sit down and count a million and half votes themselves, is that correct or?"
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1118.794,1133.867,"I would say that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and I would also add that the Appellee and the Lower Court in my opinion failed to distinguished between the election contest and a recount procedure."
1971.70-66,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1163.676,1174.701,Have your State Court had occasion to consider whether a recount proceedings was a judicial as opposed to administerial proceeding?
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1174.701,1177.75,"Not to my knowledge, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.70-66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.75,1186.126,"Mr. Johnson in Indiana, do you have a Court proceeding to appoint a Guardian or a Trustee?"
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1187.369,1188.572,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1971.70-66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.572,1193.013,Is there any parallel there to this kind of thing?
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1193.013,1197.206,"If there is a parallel, I am not aware of it."
1971.70-66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.528,1226.311,"Well, could your Court remove a Commissioner in the midst of the recount?"
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1226.311,1232.638,My understanding is the Court could remove one or could remove the entire Commission at any time during the procedure.
1971.70-66,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.505,1244.933,Could the Court determine what other procedures is followed by the Commissioners are proper or illegal?
1971.70-66,1,39590,richard_c_johnson,,1244.933,1257.186,"Yes, the Court could make that determination and in fact the Court is under a mandatory duty by the statute to make such a determination."
1971.70-66,2,29935,john_j_dillon,,1661.795,1667.643,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may I please the Court."
1971.70-66,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1691.539,1695.388,"Well, you are speaking of litigation now in the State Court in order in the Federal Court?"
1971.70-66,2,29935,john_j_dillon,,1695.388,1696.484,In the Federal Court.
1971.70-66,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1718.533,1721.837,But what was the relief asked before in the State Court?
1971.70-66,2,29935,john_j_dillon,,1721.837,1722.89,In the State Court?
1971.70-66,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1728.131,1731.919,But you say in fact it was more than a recount?
1971.70-66,2,29935,john_j_dillon,,1731.919,1746.531,"It was a contest as the Indiana Supreme Court has three times held declaring this very statute to be unconstitutional, before it was amended and after it was amended wherein the argument is made it well."
1971.70-66,3,21495,donald_a_schabel,,3457.78,3461.218,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1971.70-66,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3529.551,3530.164,Thank you gentlemen.
