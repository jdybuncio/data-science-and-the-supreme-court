1986.85-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.176,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1239, Amoco Production Company versus Village of Gambell, and No. 85-1406, Donald Hodel versus Village of Gambell."
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,19.728,37.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the Ninth Circuit's entry of a preliminary injunction against oil and gas exploration activities in two areas of the outer continental shelf lying between 25 and 350 miles from the coast of Alaska."
1986.85-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.942,148.612,"Mr. Habicht, are you going to at some time in your argument get to the geographical location of these lands?"
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,148.612,152.214,"These lands... I would be happy to, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,610.43,614.131,May I ask you a question as you make your transition?
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,623.587,635.728,"--In our view, Justice Stevens, both the scope and the applicability of Section 810 to this sale and the Ninth Circuit preliminary injunction rule both should be addressed by the Court."
1986.85-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,636.561,638.58,But if you win on one there is no need to address the other.
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,642.148,646.202,"--Well, in Kleppe versus Sierra Club we had similar circumstances."
1986.85-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.088,682.125,But is it not true that if you win on one you have won the lawsuit?
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,684.158,685.743,"It is true, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,686.443,693.863,"If be decide we only need to address one, which do think we should address?"
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,701.017,704.571,--The preliminary injunction argument has the broadest significance.
1986.85-1239,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,731.572,733.338,You will take either.
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,733.338,733.705,--and that we would urge on the Court.
1986.85-1239,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,733.705,734.69,But you will take either.
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,736.374,744.046,"We will certainly take either, and we would urge the Court to reach both because it is so seldom that a preliminary injunction issue comes before this Court."
1986.85-1239,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.332,753.735,"Well, if we address the preliminary injunction issue first in reverses there are going to be further proceedings."
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,753.735,756.853,If you address only the preliminary injunction issue there would be further proceedings.
1986.85-1239,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.37,765.209,"Well, but we shouldn't be ordering further proceedings needlessly if 810 doesn't reach this at all."
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,765.209,765.709,I agree.
1986.85-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.575,793.027,Is it clear that the 810 issue would dispose of the entire case?
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,809.422,818.178,"Well, the issue of whether aboriginal title remains on the outer continental shelf is in our view, Justice Scalla, not before the Court."
1986.85-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.178,819.528,I understand that.
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,844.595,845.178,There was a cross-petition.
1986.85-1239,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.178,846.78,There is a cross-petition on that very issue?
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,846.78,856.386,"On that very issue and it is still pending before the Court, so if this Court were to deny the cross-petition, that would dispose in our view of the aboriginal title issue."
1986.85-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.457,863.607,"It would dispose of it, but would it dispose of it fairly?"
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,868.861,875.53,"The point has been considered in the Inupiat Community case, I believe, about three years ago in which this Court denied certiorari."
1986.85-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.53,877.216,"Yes, put not in this case."
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,877.216,884.636,"It was considered by the Ninth Circuit in Gamble, the decision in Gamble I, and the Ninth Circuit held that there was no longer any aboriginal title in the outer continental shelf."
1986.85-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.576,900.48,"Why would our denial of cert... that wouldn't constitute a ruling on the merits of the issue, would it?"
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,900.48,917.024,"No, it wouldn't constitute a ruling on the merits but having a definitive Ninth Circuit ruling on the subject, and the Ninth Circuit had also ruled previously in the Inupiat case in which this Court denied cert, so in our view the issue has been squarely presented on at least two occasions to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit has rejected the contention."
1986.85-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.024,924.278,"But what you are really saying is, I suppose, if we deny cert and it remains open in the Ninth Circuit they presumably will follow their precedence In the earlier cases."
1986.85-1239,0,24071,f_henry_habicht_ii,,925.88,928.663,We presume that the Ninth Circuit precedent would be followed in the Ninth Circuit.
1986.85-1239,1,21833,e_edward_bruce,,1234.742,1250.687,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I will devote my remarks exclusively to the question of ANILCA's application to the OCS, and in doing so I think will address the concerns of Justice Scalia and Justice O'Connor regarding the reconciliation of these two statutes."
1986.85-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.634,1561.637,"You think we don't have to reach that point, whether it extends elsewhere?"
1986.85-1239,1,21833,e_edward_bruce,,1561.637,1562.37,I don't think you have to reach that point.
1986.85-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.054,1570.393,"I mean, it is sort of hard to base or decision here on that point when there is a cross-petition pending without granting that cross-petition, just decide the issue without granting the cross-petition."
1986.85-1239,1,21833,e_edward_bruce,,1570.393,1583.201,What we ask you to do is decide the proper construction of Section 810 and then ask the Court in due consideration of a pending cross-petition to take that into account as it decides to dispose of that cross-petition in an appropriate way.
1986.85-1239,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.066,1684.582,"Thank you, Mr. Bruce."
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,1688.72,1705.396,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the facts which give rise to this case concern the use of ice areas which lie off the coast of Alaska by Alaskan natives."
1986.85-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.965,1890.784,"Mr. Cooper, we don't really have this issue before us, do we?"
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,1895.105,1899.973,"Well, I think you do have it before you in this sense."
1986.85-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.409,1934.896,We shouldn't decide that neither applies when we haven't agreed to hear argument on whether one of them applies.
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,1936.682,1948.49,"Well, alternatively, what we would suggest is that it that... what I would say is that all the arguments concerning the geographic scope of the Claims Settlement Act have already been presented to the Court in this case."
1986.85-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.481,2407.602,That is the point on which the Ninth Circuit has held against you in a different case.
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2408.835,2414.339,"No, Your Honor, it held... the application of the Claims Settlement Act?"
1986.85-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.339,2416.541,"No, about the aboriginal title."
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2416.541,2421.66,"Well, Your Honor, the complaint in this case also raised that precise issue."
1986.85-1239,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.872,2473.045,"Well, did the Ninth Circuit in this case pass on your claim of aboriginal title?"
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2473.045,2482.666,What it did is that it assumed that our claim for aboriginal title was valid unless it had been extinguished by the Claims Settlement Act.
1986.85-1239,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2498.326,2500.612,"You filed a petition on that, didn't you?"
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2500.612,2502.314,"Yes, we did file a cross-petition."
1986.85-1239,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2502.314,2503.747,So it is still here.
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2503.747,2504.849,"Yes, it is still before this Court."
1986.85-1239,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.849,2507.718,So it is not before us in this case.
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2507.718,2534.618,"Well, I think I have answered Justice Scalla's question the same way, is that this case is here from a grant of a preliminary injunction, and of course on the remand, depending what this Court said in its opinion, the Ninth Circuit could go back and reconsider its decision with respect to the aboriginal title claims, as long as we would raise it."
1986.85-1239,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2534.618,2539.337,That is on your petition for cert without granting it?
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2539.337,2544.641,"Well, in a sense that would be true, but only because--"
1986.85-1239,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2544.641,2546.093,You mean we could do that?
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2546.093,2553.163,"--Yes, you could, but again, only because we're here on a preliminary injunction rather than from a final order."
1986.85-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.308,2577.628,"Mr. Cooper, when the Ninth Circuit originally decided that issue--"
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2577.628,2578.262,Yes.
1986.85-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.262,2579.564,--in the case several years ago--
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2579.564,2580.33,Yes.
1986.85-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.33,2585.634,--was that issue tied to the issue that is before us today?
1986.85-1239,2,20668,donald_s_cooper,,2585.634,2586.351,Absolutely.
1986.85-1239,3,21833,e_edward_bruce,,3424.076,3427.927,"Yes, I would like first to respond to Justice Scalia's comment."
1986.85-1239,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3468.354,3477.96,"May I ask you on that last point, to what extent does the record or the legislative history show that the offshore goes beyond three miles?"
1986.85-1239,3,21833,e_edward_bruce,,3481.012,3481.729,--Yes.
1986.85-1239,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3481.729,3489.601,"But can't that be read, if you interpret ""in Alaska"" narrowly as just referring to the immediate area immediately offshore?"
1986.85-1239,3,21833,e_edward_bruce,,3489.601,3506.563,"Your Honor, this is covered fully in the Gamble I opinion at Page 577, Volume 746 of Fed 2nd where Mr. John Pickering, then a spokesperson for a group interested in the Claims Settlement Act, made the point very explicitly that this would extend to the outer continental shelf."
1986.85-1239,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3510.431,3513.983,You think that is perfectly clear from Mr. Pickering's presentation.
1986.85-1239,3,21833,e_edward_bruce,,3513.983,3514.752,Perfectly clear.
1986.85-1239,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3514.752,3518.37,"All right, I will look at it again."
1986.85-1239,3,21833,e_edward_bruce,,3518.37,3529.226,I guess finally I would note that counsel says there would be no great disruption if the Claims Settlement Act were extended to the OCS.
1986.85-1239,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3567.485,3568.368,"Thank you, Mr. Bruce."
