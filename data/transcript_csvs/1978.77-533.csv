1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,69.407,"We'll hear arguments next in 77-533 in Hisquierdo against Hisquierdo, if that's right."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,73.341,77.733,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,167.653,197.226,"Under California law setting aside the community property division, could the divorce court after dividing the properties say, I'm going to give “X” dollars of alimony which will be paid out of the retirements fund when it becomes payable, now the origin be deferred presumably three years on your figures?"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,197.226,212.651,The rules of law of property division and the rules relating to spouses support as we call it which is equivalent to alimony or completely different alimony are spouses support will be based solely on the needs and ability of the parties.
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.651,217.942,"Well, I'm assuming he found the need and the ability is the fund."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,217.942,234.914,"I think then that under 42 U.S.C. 659 I think, or 28 U.S.C. 659 that that could be executed upon the railroad retirement funds in order to enforce payment."
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,234.914,237.949,Notwithstanding any federal statute?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,237.949,251.465,"Well, I think the federal statute specifically allows the immunity of the exemption clause not to apply to the spouses support and child support provisions."
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.875,267.824,"As a practical matter if you care to, would you suggest why that wasn't the solution to these problems instead of having it go all the route up here."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,267.824,272.872,"Well, as a practical matter both parties waive spouses support at the initiation of the proceeding in the trials courts."
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,272.872,275.854,You mean they wanted to have a lawsuit to decide it?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,275.854,287.133,"No, this issue the spouse waived her right to spouses support and what their reason for Ms. Hisquierdo's attorney, I don't know but --"
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,287.133,294.257,"They want to get this -- they want to get more money in the specific way they don't want it by the alimony route, was that it?"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,294.257,305.856,"That was their presumed intent I don't know what went on in their mind, I think what they attempted to do was to try and get the house free and clear of any other obligations."
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.856,320.692,"Well, may it never been of a reliance on their part on the proposition that the retirement benefit was community property and therefore that the claim for alimony would be less substantial or less compelling from the point of view of the wife?"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,320.692,326.518,"As I recall there is no attempt ever for, to obtain pro-rata payment."
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.598,484.66,"Mr. Endman you say the question is whether the California state court can award any part of the retirement benefit, would it make any difference if you rephrase the question to say “Is the California court entitled to treat pension benefits as community property?”"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,484.66,487.921,I think partly true and partly incorrect.
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,514.438,526.996,"Well, isn't it possible that there might be a procedural impediment to the California courts directing disposition of particular federal checks received by your client?"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,538.294,551.938,"Well, I think the exemption statute states that the railroad retirement benefits are not subject to any legal process and I submit that a divorce proceeding is a legal process."
1978.77-533,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,580.653,590.71,Well as Mr. Rehnquist point that granted everything you say does that necessarily mean you win your case?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,590.71,600.525,I think if the trial court is prevented from taking into consideration the issue of railroad retirement fund.
1978.77-533,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,600.525,618.22,"Well this is the next step, it is taken into consideration and maybe making your client just go with something else wholly apart from the inability to touch the benefit fund."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,618.22,636.028,"Well, I think this would be inconsistent with the prohibition against illegal process, any legal attempt on the part of the California courts to deal with the railroad retirement fund."
1978.77-533,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,636.028,658.366,"Well, all I'm suggesting that might that I think this is what Mr. Justice Rehnquist had in mind and I don't believe you've answered it is that all it's doing in adding up assets is destroying the benefit from into the computation without touching it but drawing on some other assets in determining the appropriate share of the community."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,658.366,658.975,Well that that --
1978.77-533,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,658.975,660.39,You say they can't do this.
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,660.39,667.369,I say they can't do this because that would amount to anticipation that there will be a receipt of these benefits.
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,667.369,673.268,You mean they can't do indirectly what their prohibited by statute from doing directly is that it?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,673.268,674.184,Exactly.
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.184,693.413,"Well, isn't that a little simplistic in the sense counsel, certainly after that your has deposited his check in the bank that he receives from the pension benefits and it becomes in a general fund in his bank account it can be levied one, can it?"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,693.413,695.158,I believe that there are cases dealing --
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.158,696.054,For alimony.
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,696.982,699.547,"Well for alimony, well I don't contend that --"
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.547,709.989,"Well no, can't his bank account be garnished after the check is clear and that check is in the bank."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,709.989,717.033,I believe there is an exemption would apply to any creditors and would continue as long as it's in the bank now.
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,765.101,778.301,"Does your argument depend on equating a decree of a divorced court with the language garnishment, attachment or other legal process under 435 U.S.C. 231m."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,778.301,785.949,Yes with the other legal process portion of it rather than the garnishment or attachment.
1978.77-533,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.949,796.584,"So doesn't the -- most recent amendment, not to most recent amendments does forbid garnishment to satisfy community property."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,796.584,805.951,The prior to leaving Los Angeles at least to supplement to our code books indicated that --
1978.77-533,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.951,808.965,"Well, how about the 77 amendments?"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,808.965,826.033,"Well, I assumed that would have been in the 78 supplement net still as contain as Mr. Justice Rehnquist indicated that garnishment, attachment or other legal process or nor shall any attempt to be made to anticipate those program."
1978.77-533,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.033,826.522,Right.
1978.77-533,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.522,830.664,And how long does this exemption last.
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,840.649,853.556,I think under the cases as I indicated as cited by the respondents that exemption would last so long as it is in a bank available for his needs while he's alive apparently even to the extent of where he is buried.
1978.77-533,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,853.556,855.622,So it will last a lifetime.
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,855.622,855.812,Pardon?
1978.77-533,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,855.812,857.377,It will last his lifetime.
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,857.377,866.944,It could last his lifetime as long as there are left in a bank or savings in a long type investment where it's immediately available to him.
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,866.944,875.548,But the benefit of the protection would disappear if he bought some real estate and sold it to the profit and bought some more real estate.
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,880.057,888.358,"Well, I think the protection would disappear when the moneys were place into an investment."
1978.77-533,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,895.182,899.2,What about it would be mutual fund?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,899.2,901.434,A mutual fund.
1978.77-533,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.434,903.069,Is that an investment?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,903.069,905.303,I would consider that an investment.
1978.77-533,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,905.303,906.588,Alright.
1978.77-533,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,906.588,907.215,Mr. Endman --
1978.77-533,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,907.215,909.059,Is that good or bad?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,911.295,919.425,I think that could be gotten to a mutual fund investment since it's no longer immediately available for his needs.
1978.77-533,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,919.425,922.876,The different between a mutual fund and the bank is?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,922.876,932.493,I think in the bank you can go that day to the bank to get some money for food or groceries what have you and a mutual fund is a little more difficult requiring some clearance.
1978.77-533,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,932.493,938.948,"Mr. Endman, isn't the only issue before us as to who owns the retirement benefit before it's actually paid?"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,951.05,952.138,"No, that's, no as I say --"
1978.77-533,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,952.138,953.705,So who owns the benefit.
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,953.705,961.853,It's who owns the benefit at this point and whether the court can anticipate him receiving the benefit as I pointed out in this case --
1978.77-533,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,961.853,970.404,"The question is whether it would be anticipation within the meaning of the federal statute to apply the community property law and say it's now owned half by the wife that's whole case, is it not?"
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,970.404,987.912,"Right, I submit to the Court that under each of these inquiries the state law will be an obstacle to the preemption of the Railroad Retirement Act."
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.642,1132.856,"Well, if one could demonstrate that the Railroad Retirement Act were contractual, would that hurt your case."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,1132.856,1141.086,"In this aspect yes, I don't think it can be demonstrated because using these facts as an example."
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.198,1165.579,But he had to perform services for Santa Fe in order to acquire them?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,1165.579,1177.021,He performed services in order to be eligible for the social insurance benefit that's a foundation for the satisfaction or the eligibility requirements.
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.65,1214.693,"Well, would you think under your Flemming against Nestor analogy that Congress after this man had worked 20 years for Santa Fe Railroad and had an accrued pension where I could simply declare that he no longer had such a right."
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,1214.693,1227.315,I don't think they can do that without running into some problems with the due process clause but -- and probably some other political ramifications.
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.059,1254.727,But what money is Congress spending in this case?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,1254.727,1275.333,"Congress, if the income is sufficient -- insufficient will by appropriations have to make funds and this of course one of the problems that in reading the newspapers that the social security is running into is that, they're constantly raising the taxes to the point to some support these funds."
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1275.333,1281.938,Well is there any indication of the Santa Fe can't meet the burden of its pensions that it's going to have to call on the Government?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,1281.938,1285.868,Well this is not a Santa Fe pension.
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1292.451,1297.102,You mean the pension checks actually come from the Government?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,1297.102,1300.254,"Yes, I believe that's the way it is."
1978.77-533,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.662,1402.052,Why do say this Court spoke of force and clarity in Wissner?
1978.77-533,0,30168,james_d_endman,,1402.052,1414.743,"Well even though it was divided opinion, the opinion itself says that they have spoken with force in Congress -- Congress has spoken excuse me, I apologized."
1978.77-533,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1492.444,1508.915,Mrs. Stillman.
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1508.915,1512.564,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.685,1602.209,"Mrs. Stillman, perhaps you can answer the question that your co-counsel and I are uncertain about and that is, do these pension payments come in a form of a government check and if so is the Government paying out money that was previously paid to it by Santa Fe?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1602.209,1606.109,"Your Honor, it comes out in a form from the U.S.Treasury."
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.301,1632.559,Employee Tier II?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1632.559,1640.991,"An employees tier II, although after the 74 Act employees only pay the amount on their earnings that they would pay under social security that's all they pay."
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.018,1674.916,Is the general scheme of the Act to make it self-financing?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1674.916,1679.832,"Yes, but in the sense that that the -- but it's not a funded scheme."
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.224,1756.177,"When you say to protect these funds for the worker, do you think Congress really meant to cut that deep into the social policy of the states and if the state policy was to say that, if the worker and was married there was a marital community to exclude the wife from the benefit?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1756.177,1766.249,"Yes, we think Congress did cut this deep here and if I could, I could address the particular terms which I think show that attention Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.586,1776.639,Do you think that a divorce decree is legal process for that to go through?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1776.639,1803.994,"We think that to allow a spouse to bring the workers expected future annuity payments into the divorce action for adjudication which is what she's doing, is in effect to subject into legal process and we think this is so whether the order that she seeks is to compel a transfer of the equivalent proportion of the present value or in order to -- to collect out of the funds and out of the payments as their later paid to her."
1978.77-533,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.06,1821.244,"Mrs. Stillman, on that point, do you go as far as the other counsel did and argued that the divorce Court may not even take in account in figuring out what will be a fair spouse's award, the fact that such a benefit will in the future be available to the husband?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1821.244,1829.484,We think the Court is precluded from doing that by the anticipation clause and by this legal process.
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1829.484,1829.921,Does this --
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1829.921,1830.53,Clause.
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.53,1836.835,"Does this record show the value of this, the annuity value of this as so of the time?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1836.835,1840.141,"I don't believe the record shows that, it would be rather high because --"
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.141,1840.189,As you think so?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1840.189,1842.912,"-- because he's two years away from retirement, two or three years away from retirement."
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1842.912,1847.102,And that kind of annuity would cause a very large sum of money.
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1848.777,1860.839,"It would greatly exceed the equity that l believe the equity in the house was approximately $12,500.00 total and I'm sure that it would be very difficult to take a proportional value of that pension out of that Act."
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1860.839,1864.999,And what's the amount that he's going to receive?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1864.999,1866.763,The amount that he will receive?
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.763,1869.528,In per months?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1869.528,1873.378,"I have -- I know that outside the record, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.378,1877.806,"Well, outside the record for the moment since it's only hypothetical, tell me."
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1877.806,1881.267,I believe it's something in excess of $700.00 a month.
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.267,1889.826,"And that would cost to for a man at the age of 60, close to a $100,000.00 to buy that as a single premium annuity."
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1889.826,1895.295,"It would be, it would be very high and there's the relationship between that and the equity that's available in other community."
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.295,1900.485,"So you say this, the courts of California may not even take it into account when they divide it?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1900.485,1910.396,"No, Your honor, we think that what they propose to do is to use that amount in a paper transaction here to offset other value in the community."
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1914.987,1922.682,But your friend whose argue -- whose supporting -- whose argument your supporting has said that they could of have done this by way alimony.
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1922.682,1929.686,"That's true and the reason they could this by way of alimony, we think this would be true only since 1975."
1978.77-533,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.023,1955.115,So that when the alimony -- amount of alimony is set --
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1955.115,1955.353,That's right.
1978.77-533,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.353,1961.179,"By the judge, let's assume that the man was going to have no income whatsoever, except his annuity --"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1961.179,1962.337,Correct.
1978.77-533,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.337,1964.921,And $700.00 a month.
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1970.887,1973.17,I think they can do since 1975.
1978.77-533,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.17,1973.204,Yes.
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1973.204,1974.534,Because there is now the correct one.
1978.77-533,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.534,1977.496,That to the extent that you can garnish it you could take it into account.
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1977.496,1982.167,"Certainly, yes and that's a sensible reflection of the policy which Congress has now."
1978.77-533,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.033,1995.223,But the statute also negatives the use of it for other purposes.
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,1995.223,2010.85,"It certainly does because in 1977 they revised the -- they didn't revise, they clarified the definition of alimony in the Social Security Act and expressly excluded community property settlements of the type of order that would result in this divorce proceeding."
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.85,2015.279,Well is that by in terms applied to railroad retirement benefits?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2015.279,2024.416,"That -- well that definition applies to this override provision which by its terms does apply to benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act, yes."
1978.77-533,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.605,2037.817,"Why was the community property singled out, is there any reason?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2037.817,2038.753,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1978.77-533,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.753,2046.35,Why was community property singled out for special treatment in the last Act?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2046.35,2049.424,"Well that's, that's a matter for Congress Your Honor."
1978.77-533,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2051.338,2057.386,There's no other reason in the history?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2057.386,2072.092,"I can't say Your Honor why exactly they decided to stop at alimony and child support although I think a reasonable view would be that when you're dealing with alimony and child support, you're dealing with actual need and Congress is doing a balancing here."
1978.77-533,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2072.123,2077.081,"When you do a community -- when you separate community property, you're dealing with need too, aren't you?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2077.081,2079.228,"Well, not necessarily no, as I understand --"
1978.77-533,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2079.228,2081.841,"Well, in this case, this woman needs some --"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2081.841,2083.216,It's not established that she needs it.
1978.77-533,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.216,2084.514,But doesn't she?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2084.514,2085.699,She has her own earnings.
1978.77-533,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.958,2127.317,"But Mrs. Stillman, I don't think the need anything else is involved in this."
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2133.199,2134.534,Certainly.
1978.77-533,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.534,2134.644,Isn't that right?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2134.644,2149.919,"Although movie actors would not be covered by this Act but we would just say that Congress has a policy here that they've made inroad into this protection, that they've established for this payments and they've only gone so far as making it for alimony and child support."
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.091,2185.103,Doesn't 659 or just referred to garnishment?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2185.103,2187.676,"No this is something else, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.676,2194.77,"I don't mean that Section you immediately just cite but 659 which is, I understand that the 75 Amendment."
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2194.77,2206.722,Refers only garnishment but we think that a reasonable interpretation of the Act in the light of that now instead it would be acceptable to consider alimony since it can be garnished.
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.722,2215.148,"Well but then it isn't an entirely accurate to say that the 75 Act by its terms applies to the treatment of community property, is it in Railroad Retirement Act?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2215.148,2215.607,Oh!
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.493,2240.348,"But you're still talking it about it under the umbrella of alimony or rather of garnishment, are you not?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2240.348,2241.356,"That's true, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.356,2250.965,And if the award of community property is not garnishment then that statute I take it would not apply?
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2250.965,2256.592,That's true but we think that there still can be no anticipation.
1978.77-533,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.017,2260.093,"That's a different argument, isn't that?"
1978.77-533,1,23149,elinor_h_stillman,,2260.093,2264.293,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.523,2335.745,Mr. Fields.
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2335.745,2338.837,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2374.176,2380.716,"Under the Railroad Retirement Act, what happens if this man dies before he reaches age 60?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2380.716,2385.425,"Well at this point Mr. Chief Justice, the respondent would be entitled to nothing."
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2387.858,2389.804,"Well, what happens to the money?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2391.8,2393.775,It remains in the fund.
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2393.775,2394.352,It's forfeited?
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2394.352,2395.568,"The trust account fund, it is forfeited."
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2395.568,2398.071,"As treated to the fund, in other words."
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2398.071,2398.269,Exactly.
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2398.269,2402.029,But if they had remained marriage she would have received part of it?
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2402.029,2404.375,She would receive a survivor's benefit.
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2405.71,2409.084,In other words it's a joint and survivorship annuity in effect.
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2409.084,2411.846,Yes.
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2496.65,2519.304,"Generally speaking, California's, that domestic relations law on how its administered is none of our business but tell me whether the California courts still have jurisdiction to grant alimony in this case or to re-examine this case depending on the outcome -- to re-examine the case in California, depending on the outcome of this appeal in this rule?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2519.304,2537.082,"In this case Mr. Chief Justice, for reasons unknown to me that the attorney who tried the case did waive spousal support, and I believed that on remand, the respondent would not be entitled to claim any more spousal support."
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2593.147,2597.716,How could you read the statute that will allow us to do that?
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2597.716,2598.902,Excuse me Mr. Justice Marshall?
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.902,2603.132,How would read the statute that says you just can't do this?
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2605.695,2610.054,I don't believe there is a statute saying that California cannot do this.
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2620.243,2624.963,Well that's what I'm waiting for you to explain it and why didn't you just say so?
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2624.963,2627.107,With regard to the issue of the anticipation.
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2644.52,2647.644,Well what do you think anticipation means?
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2647.644,2653.601,It is a word of our taking out of spendthrift trusts.
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.887,2683.893,"Yes, but the statute is not a word of art."
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2687.646,2691.117,"Now, the statute does not say, the wife cannot collect and you also have to --"
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2691.117,2695.069,"Well, why was the statute amended in 75?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2695.069,2699.909,"The 75 Amendment, merely speaks -- are you talking about --"
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2699.909,2702.592,Surplusage.
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2702.592,2707.121,We do not believe that the 75 Amendment was directed to the wife who we believe to be --
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.121,2709.085,"Well, how about the 77?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2709.085,2722.796,The 77 Amendment regarding garnishment expressly -- it does not recognize a community interest but you have to look in light of the purpose of the enactment of that legislation.
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2749.574,2751.92,"It didn't waive without the community property, it did?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2751.92,2752.647,"No, it did not."
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.144,2754.631,It could have but it didn't.
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2754.631,2757.044,It could have Mr. Justice Marshall but --
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.044,2761.034,"But you recognize that it did prohibit it, didn't you?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2763.948,2771.235,It prohibits garnishment of the retirement funds by the respondent but that statute does not prohibit --
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2771.235,2779.67,"No, my question was that, it didn't take our community property so they lifted in and you must take and they say that's right."
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2781.736,2797.872,"I meant -- we submit Mr. Justice Marshall that Congress was only addressing that one problem, that problem of fathers and husbands evading their support obligations rather than their community property obligations."
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2809.445,2812.776,Except they said no legal proceeding.
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2812.776,2818.616,"Well, legal proceeding is also what we contend in a word of art."
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2818.616,2821.301,It has certain exceptions like divorce.
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2821.301,2825.69,"Yes, but the mere adding up of an asset in a community --"
1978.77-533,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.69,2833.153,"Well, if divorce is not legal proceeding, why do you lawyers charge fees?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2835.985,2846.946,"Well, the divorce is a legal proceeding but the aspect of adding up this benefit as a community property asset is really not a legal process per se."
1978.77-533,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.946,2849.758,Mr. Fields can I just follow up on one thought.
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2856.612,2865.194,"My answer was that again, this was a word included in an exemption statute enacted during the depression."
1978.77-533,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2889.645,2892.5,"Well, but that may be a reason why their interpretation is wrong."
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2898.235,2904.62,"I believe that it's redundant, that it was inserted in there by someone who is drafting that particular --"
1978.77-533,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2904.62,2909.998,"You don't think it means anything more than the preceding clause which refers to garnishment, attachment and other legal process?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2909.998,2921.676,"No, I personally do not believe it means anything more than that and there's no history especially as indicated in the 1935 hearing reports cited on our brief that Congress intended by that schedule to preempt --"
1978.77-533,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.676,2923.83,"Well, your answer is it's totally redundant?"
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2923.83,2925.295,It's totally redundant.
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.786,2943.549,"Would it be possibly also be speculative since Mrs. Stillman said that if he died before reaching age 60 that whole fund is wiped out, that is there is no fund, there is no asset anymore."
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,2943.549,2946.052,"Well, That is correct Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-533,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2953.819,2971.617,"Well, the redundancy if there is one is really between the prohibition against anticipation and the statutory requirement for benefits, service time and so forth rather than the statutory prohibition against anticipation and the statutory prohibition against garnishment, isn't it?"
1978.77-533,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.617,2975.49,"Yes, we believe so."
1978.77-533,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3184.653,3192.745,But that legislation if I have identified it correctly as specifically applicable only to civil service retirees isn't it?
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,3192.745,3194.09,Yes.
1978.77-533,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3196.715,3200.248,Because that illustrates that Congress could do this if they wanted to.
1978.77-533,2,27014,howard_m_fields,,3200.248,3200.755,Yes.
1978.77-533,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3270.062,3291.16,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock counsels.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3294.052,3295.429,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3295.429,3296.272,Very well.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3300.362,3304.135,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.41,3345.023,"In your view, if the judge simply said perhaps to himself first, “I'm going to take into account that there is about a $100,000.00 asset here, contingent upon the man's surviving."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3355.152,3355.978,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3371.07,3371.377,But then --
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3371.377,3372.844,It could be taken into account.
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3372.844,3380.555,"Then, then what if the gentleman died either a week before or a year after?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3380.555,3381.723,"Well, Your Honor, if the gentleman dies --"
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3381.723,3383.789,"And after they had vested, after it vested?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3383.789,3402.386,"If the gentleman dies or indeed in a private pension case, if he leaves employment and is no longer entitled under the private plan any benefits, then the Court has to retain jurisdiction on the theory that there is insufficient evidence on which to value the plan and the Court can do that and does do it quite commonly --"
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3402.386,3405.001,You mean the continuing jurisdiction of the domestic court?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3405.001,3406.781,"Of the divorce court, that is correct Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3484.417,3487.389,Well but this does not involve alimony or child support?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3487.389,3488.227,"That's correct, Your Honor, it does not."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3488.227,3493.369,"Well, whether or not California can consider this community property and that is the only issue, isn't it?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3493.369,3495.034,"I absolutely agree with you, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3511.893,3512.392,Right.
1978.77-533,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3512.392,3520.608,"Mrs. Kay, as another way of stating the issue you say, the question is whether the present value of the pension can be listed as a community asset."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3531.593,3535.733,"Well, not under California practice, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3567.58,3581.295,"No, but would it not be your view that if the Government is correct here and of course it has not been decided, that all that would mean would be that this particular asset would be treated in the total picture as an asset belonging to the husband."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3585.864,3586.431,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3594.022,3595.617,Well if it is community property --
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3595.617,3596.304,"That is correct, if it is --"
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3596.304,3600.923,But Mr. Justice Stevens said if the Government is correct in this case.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3602.188,3604.733,"Well, oh, I beg your pardon here, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3616.379,3620.509,Is it not a -- may not -- maybe I'm just terribly ignorant about California law.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3625.966,3626.725,That is correct.
1978.77-533,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3635.733,3637.178,"Well, I understand but he could do that?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3637.178,3637.617,"Yes, he could do that."
1978.77-533,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3637.617,3640.332,I take your opponent said he could not and I just want to --
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3640.332,3641.478,"No, I don't."
1978.77-533,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3643.173,3645.297,"Well then, I guess I did misunderstand."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3646.014,3661.269,"The -- I think one fundamental point that that has been overlooked here, the Chief Justice put his finger on it early this morning by asking what made the difference whether the defendant's spouse took this property as community property or as an alimony award."
1978.77-533,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3685.559,3687.852,"Alimony awards are also a taxable, are they not?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3687.852,3688.411,I beg you pardon?
1978.77-533,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3688.411,3691.415,Aren't alimony awards generally taxable to the recipient?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3691.415,3695.712,"They are generally taxable to the recipient, that is correct Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3695.712,3712.766,But now -- if you're correct and if this property the present value of the expectancy is therefore properly includable as property of the community.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3730.784,3733.976,"Well, Your Honor that's the question of valuation if --"
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3733.976,3736.459,"Well, it is but now we're talking about the present value."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3736.459,3736.878,That's correct and --
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3736.878,3738.754,"At which is let's say, $20,000.00 for it."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3738.754,3740.551,"Well, if for example the court --"
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3740.551,3751.671,"And that's divided in half and the wife on the dissolution of the marriage therefore gets half of that $10,000.00 or whatever it is."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3762.655,3768.927,"No, Your Honor in the case that you pose, because of the uncertainty of his living until the pension matures."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3768.927,3772.468,"He has lived by my -- in my hypothesis, he has lived that long."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3772.468,3779.512,What I'm saying is that the trial court who has acted presumably before the husband has lived to the time in your hypothetical.
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3812.309,3815.181,"But if you're correct, the judge would have to do that."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3817.814,3820.229,That is correct but the burden.
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3820.229,3820.978,It's not income.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3821.525,3822.182,hat's correct.
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3822.182,3831.05,And he and the judge if you're correct could simply order the division of half to the wife on the solution of the marriage of the present value of the expectancy.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3831.05,3832.437,"Yes, Your Honor he could do that."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3832.475,3835.766,And if she got that then the -- she could keep it.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3835.766,3835.936,Oh!
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3850.635,3853.522,"Well, I'm assuming all the discounting and the problem --"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3853.522,3854.081,"If that's true, Your Honor --"
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3854.081,3857.293,"Unless you end up with the value of $20,000.00 and you divide it in two."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3857.293,3858.079,"That's true, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3859.636,3863.708,"Well, but there again is a practical matter and it's beyond our jurisdiction."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3874.956,3875.283,That's correct.
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3875.283,3893.513,"And he would hardly ascribed any fixed value to it but does that not also suggest and again, this is not our business that the railroad retirement pension or any other similar pension is a subject for due to be dealt with under alimony not under community property."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3893.513,3895.08,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1978.77-533,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3928.405,3939.579,"Isn't it true, Mrs. Kay that California for a long time has treated insurance and nobody is paid by private insurance companies as community property rather than the alimony?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,3939.579,3951.182,That's correct Your Honor and we also treat good will attributable to legal practice as community property even though it can't be sold by the lawyer.
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4075.98,4081.916,But the Government says this is not a preemption case.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4081.916,4086.14,"Your Honor, I don't understand the Government to say it's not a preemption case."
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4086.946,4090.3,"I heard the Government's standing is moot, standing right where you are?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4090.3,4098.575,"Yes, they rely in their brief on the Wissner case which is a preemption case."
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4110.749,4118.292,How can I understand the Government position be that there's a specific statute that doesn't say preemption or anything else?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4133.019,4141.897,"Well, Justice Marshall, the only two provisions the Railroad Retirement Act that they rely on to say that or the anti-assignment provision."
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4157.127,4159.064,But does this apply?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4159.064,4159.801,I beg your pardon?
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4159.801,4164.698,Does the provision apply to all of the class sections all over the country?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4164.698,4165.058,Does what apply --
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4165.058,4168.323,Does it limit it to community property?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4168.323,4170.26,I'm sorry I didn't hear you.
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4170.26,4174.229,Will the decision in this case apply to all 50 States of America?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4174.229,4174.857,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4177.679,4178.377,Why?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4178.377,4186.6,Because only in the eight community property states is the wife treated as a co-owner of property as and when it is acquired.
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4201.687,4205.268,Does that apply to maximum of eight with no certainty and not all eight?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4205.268,4208.43,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4245.6,4252.277,So there's nothing -- there's nothing speculative about the value of a life insurance policy is there?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4272.235,4275.968,"Well, Your Honor, the question of how this retirement annuity is valued."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4277.595,4288.419,"No, I know it isn't but there are some practical aspects to this case which we've all been exploring and they are very importance to the element resolution to the problem perhaps."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4294.854,4295.194,"Yes, well Your Honor if (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4295.194,4297.647,How do you use survivorship rights here?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4297.647,4298.455,Yes.
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4311.869,4317.545,But how do you do that on annuity which will terminate on the incident of the death of this man?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4317.545,4320.629,"Well, you look for example at mortality tables indicating how long his likely to live."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4320.629,4325.387,"Well, but what if he steps off of the curve and gets hit by a truck and mortality table isn't going to help that?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4325.387,4343.027,"That's right but actuaries, I understand are able to take account of factors of that kind and at any event, the California courts or saved by the fact that if the actuarial figures are not sufficient in the discretion of the court to make an immediate award, all the court need to do is retain jurisdictions."
1978.77-533,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4355.029,4359.905,"Do the California courts face similar problems, and value, and purely private pension rights?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4359.905,4367.498,"Absolutely, Your Honor and that was one of the major arguments in Marriage of Brown against the position that the court took."
1978.77-533,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4518.092,4526.966,"Have we met this in Court, the survivorship provision as a federal law which must prevail if it conflicts with state law?"
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4526.966,4548.3,"Yes, Your Honor but the Court also said that it would seem obvious that the bonds may not be used as a device to deprive the widow of property rights, which she enjoys under Washington law and which would not be transferable by her husband but for the survivorship provisions of the federal bonds."
1978.77-533,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4594.377,4608.589,"Mrs.Kay, let me interrupt just a second, you're saying that they void the -- they voided here avoiding the Congress writing a federal domestic relations law but really you're arguing that you don't want this property to be substitute to any domestic relations law."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4614.455,4619.85,"Well, Your Honor the -- in California, we speak of community property law as domestic relations law."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4692.253,4697.261,"Yes, but my Brother Stevens' point is that community property law is property law."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4700.173,4701.76,"But it's confined to married people, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4701.76,4710.535,-- it's very app -- it's certainly but it's applicable in terms of inheritance and bequest and all sorts of other property transactions and concepts.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4718.353,4719.282,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4719.282,4719.939,-- wholly unrelated.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4719.939,4720.945,That's correct.
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4722.32,4730.148,And alimony by contract has to do with or spousal support as you call it in California has to do with need and ability to pay?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4730.148,4730.565,That's right.
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4730.565,4734.286,And community property has nothing whatsoever to do with either?
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4734.286,4736.3,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-533,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4793.327,4803.269,Community property really depends upon the concept of the contribution of each of the partner to the marriage where its alimony depends on the need of the partners after the marriage is dissolved.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4803.269,4805.894,"That's absolutely right, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4840.938,4866.112,"Well, I didn't understand the Government to be saying his brief with what you understand that we're saying my perception of it was that the Government simply conceded that of course in determining whether and to what extent and what amount to grant an alimony award or spousal support award, the Court may consider the ability to pay of the husband and part of that ability to pay depends upon his expectancy of retirement that's all it said."
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4866.112,4887.608,"That's right, Your Honor but the point I'm making is that the Government then throughout its brief at four or five points contrast what it refers to as the mechanical division of property under community property laws with this need on the theory I think that it is better to relegate the spouse to the alimony award rather than to a court or to dignity the property right."
1978.77-533,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4888.556,4896.167,Maybe what the Government says in its brief lies in the eye of the beholder but I didn't -- I read it little differently.
1978.77-533,3,27422,herma_hill_kay,,4896.167,4902.982,"Well, I hope upon reflection Mr. Justice Stewart you have reason to read it differently again."
1978.77-533,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4936.927,4939.46,Thank you Mrs. Kay.
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,4942.412,4943.979,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-533,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4980.269,4986.055,"(Voice Overlap) because the statute doesn't apply to life insurance annuity and it does apply here, is that it?"
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,4986.055,4987.953,"No, I believe it's more than that Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-533,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4987.953,4990.566,What else?
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,4990.566,5009.253,What we have here is a situation identical to Social Security that those who are presently working are paying a tax under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act that goes into the Government and then is appropriated to take care of those who are presently retired.
1978.77-533,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5025.325,5033.911,"Would you mean that a recipient, the railroad retiree doesn't have a contractual right to recover the payments?"
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,5033.911,5042.529,His right should he die prematurely would extend only to a code section that provides --
1978.77-533,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5042.529,5044.894,"No, I'm talking about during his lifetime."
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,5051.37,5054.482,"Well, under the -- yes, he would the right to enforce that under Fourteenth Amendment."
1978.77-533,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5054.482,5059.191,"Well he run under -- he run under the decision of Flemming against Nestor, wouldn't he in trying that?"
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,5059.191,5073.554,"Yes, that's what we are referring to as this Court stated in the Flemming case I submit is the exact same situation that we are dealing with in railroad retirement that they are part of that same exact scheme."
1978.77-533,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5073.554,5077.488,It's a statutory entitlement until the statute is amended.
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,5077.488,5080.42,Yes.
1978.77-533,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5216.421,5230.258,"Why, suppose the California courts would say that if he'd worked on a railroad for 40 years and had a pension and she'd worked at home raising kids and keeping house for 40 years, that if he simply walks off with the major asset that's accrued from his income during that time."
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,5234.527,5235.885,I don't see that as being a fraud.
1978.77-533,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5265.092,5269.132,"Well, but that (Voice Overlap) whether it's separate property or not?"
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,5269.132,5271.036,"Well, that would be up to the state to decide --"
1978.77-533,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5271.036,5275.308,"Yes, and here the state has said it is not separate property."
1978.77-533,4,30168,james_d_endman,,5275.308,5287.525,"Right, the state has said it's a community property but we submit is because of the conflict involved that even if it is community property the state has no right to touch it."
1978.77-533,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5291.174,5292.002,Thank you counsel.
