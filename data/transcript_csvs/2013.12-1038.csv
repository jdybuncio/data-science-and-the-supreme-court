2013.12-1038,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.405,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 12-1038, United States v. Apel."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,6.468,8.654,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,41.344,49.903,"But it is -- it is in the Air Force manual and in a JAG opinion, was the exclusive possession criterion."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,49.903,54.386,"Well, I think I would say a couple things about those sources, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-1038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.014,98.212,"Has -- since this case has been pending quite a while, has the manual changed, has -- to -- to delete the exclusive possession?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,98.212,102.195,"If Your Honor is referring to the -- the U.S. Attorneys' manual, no."
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,171.45,172.981,"How do we tell that, Mr. Horwich?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,178.666,183.056,--Military command is a question of lawful authority.
2013.12-1038,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,210.607,215.356,"Well, some military installations are located in very rural areas."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,238.69,242.08,"It -- it would, although let me say a few things about that."
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,295.653,303.307,"But a map, presumably, reflects who owns the property, and you, yourself, say that that's not what's significant."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,314.692,315.973,"Yes, yes."
2013.12-1038,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,338.464,343.072,But I'm not sure that I can -- that I follow that completely.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,422.197,432.27,"Well, I guess, just to take the last point there, I would disagree with the premise that the military is not using these lands in their operation."
2013.12-1038,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,449.077,451.185,"Well, you close down -- you close down roads for parades."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,454.95,455.511,--Certainly.
2013.12-1038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.993,491.444,"And that's confirmed in the terms of the easement, if you look at the easement between the U.S. and the County of Santa Barbara."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,491.444,492.991,"Precisely so, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-1038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.991,500.659,The -- it makes it very clear that the military commander has authority to exercise control over the easement property.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,500.659,501.518,"The -- precisely so, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-1038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.168,532.084,"If -- if your position is right, and I -- I think there would be nothing left of Flowers, because Flowers, the government owned that area as well."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,550.78,551.311,"No, not at all, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-1038,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,613.381,615.739,Suppose that the Respondent in this case didn't want to protest.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,629.188,658.051,"--So his -- the terms of his barment order and the ordinary terms on which barment orders are issued at Vandenberg is that there's an exception carved out for him to traverse along the easement, which, again, is in the nature of a concession to public convenience, which it seems quite unfair to sort of -- to say that, well, the military has wound up worse off by trying to accommodate its -- trying to accommodate itself, to the extent consistent with its security needs, to public use and convenience."
2013.12-1038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,658.051,658.926,And where is this?
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,662.674,664.877,"Yes, it's on page 64 of the Joint Appendix."
2013.12-1038,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,688.173,690.361,"He couldn't go to the public school, though?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,695.967,697.497,That's -- that's correct.
2013.12-1038,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,707.104,726.471,"It seems such an odd thing for a Class B misdemeanor to be used to protect the national security; that Congress has determined that the threat is so great, that the only thing you need is a Class B misdemeanor to protect the U.S.--"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,726.471,728.143,"--Well, it's certainly not the only thing."
2013.12-1038,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,734.639,735.796,--There are some pretty severe ones.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,736.139,735.796,--There are some severe ones.
2013.12-1038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.511,747.072,Are there no sanctions for trespassing upon Federal property that is not a military base?
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,747.072,749.385,"Justice Scalia, absolutely, there are."
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,757.661,764.409,"Do you think, Mr. Horwich, that there is any point at which a military installation can lose its character as such?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,804.58,821.122,"Well, I think, if it's still under the formal command of the military officer and the military officer is empowered to issue regulations and issue barments, which this Court has long recognized is the necessary concomitant of the functioning of a military installation, then, no, it continues--"
2013.12-1038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.122,833.085,"I -- I assume it would be contrary to -- to his orders to permit such installations, without his ability to control them."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,833.085,834.412,--Exactly--
2013.12-1038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.412,836.287,Including by issuing debarment orders.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,837.927,838.896,"--No, that's exactly right."
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,866.62,871.511,"So what happens, for example, at -- at the school if there's an assault on school premises?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,872.448,895.533,"--In the -- in the school premises, I -- I believe -- I don't want to be quite certain about this, but I believe that the -- well, certainly, the elementary school and I believe, also, the middle school is within the area that is -- within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the United States."
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,907.841,909.138,Federal -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,909.513,911.668,No.
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,911.668,915.339,"--I mean, who -- who comes in -- is it -- is it members of the military?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,918.058,918.322,No.
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,974.504,984.532,"--Well, I guess I'm just wondering with respect to each of these places, I mean, the highway, the school, the Amtrak station, who's actually in control when something goes wrong in these places?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,984.532,992.296,"--Well, let me bracket off the Amtrak station because we don't think the Amtrak station is under military command, and I'll -- I can explain why."
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1000.993,1002.572,The security forces meaning--
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1002.572,1003.259,The military.
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1003.259,1003.788,--the military.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1003.788,1004.57,"Now, they will detain--"
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1004.57,1008.365,So do military personnel actively patrol this entire area?
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1008.365,1008.772,--Yes.
2013.12-1038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1083.553,1086.724,It could have said -- it could have said that Apel can't use the highway.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1088.036,1091.02,Yes.
2013.12-1038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1091.02,1091.66,Is that what you're saying?
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1091.66,1101.174,"Yes, it would be, in -- in -- in the same way that the commanding officer can determine that any particular use of the highway is inconsistent with the military's needs."
2013.12-1038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1111.702,1120.321,"I suppose, if the commander thought it was necessary, he could stop trucks with flammable materials from coming through at the time when a launch is being prepared and so forth?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1120.321,1120.882,Precisely so.
2013.12-1038,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1179.58,1185.281,"Mr. Horwich, can I ask you this, which is -- this question is stimulated by what Justice Kagan asked."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1213.112,1217.112,--That's -- I could--
2013.12-1038,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1217.112,1226.561,"Now, do you understand that the -- the Ninth Circuit's holding to be based on access or to be based on jurisdiction over crimes that are committed there?"
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1226.561,1228.919,"--No, I understand it to be based on neither of those things."
2013.12-1038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1243.477,1245.554,But that's not Respondent's theory here.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1245.554,1247.271,"No, it's not Respondent's theory here."
2013.12-1038,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1278.917,1287.945,"Well, there may be -- suppose property is leased to -- I don't know whether this actually ever occurs -- but suppose it's leased to the United States and used for a military reservation."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1293.253,1302.875,"Well, the -- that's -- that's a matter that is decided under the -- the Enclaves Clause of the Constitution, it says that the State has to cede to the United States--"
2013.12-1038,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1302.875,1303.469,Right.
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1303.469,1304.297,--that jurisdiction.
2013.12-1038,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1395.919,1401.525,"But I -- I had thought that, in your brief, you thought that the ownership test was both underinclusive and overinclusive."
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1401.525,1410.832,"Yes, I think that's correct, too, because there are certainly property that the United States owns -- plenty of property -- most property that the United States owns isn't under military command."
2013.12-1038,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1449.009,1453.896,Could I just ask you what we should make of this -- what we should make of this green line?
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1453.896,1454.693,Yes.
2013.12-1038,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1454.693,1456.036,What is the significance of the green line?
2013.12-1038,0,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1456.036,1471.389,"The -- speaking outside the record, it seems like it was probably drawn to guide road crews in the parts of the road they should be resurfacing because one of the terms of the easements is that California is responsible for maintaining the road."
2013.12-1038,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.267,1524.47,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1530.108,1533.217,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1038,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1575.247,1587.07,"But that -- that was a First Amendment case and the -- and the problem there was that he was barred for a peaceful protest the first time around, and that's not -- that's not this case."
2013.12-1038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1587.07,1590.289,Flower -- Flower was with the street.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.289,1596.066,"It was not argued in that case that the statute didn't apply, and that's what you're arguing here."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1596.066,1598.112,"--Your Honor, there are two arguments here."
2013.12-1038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1606.406,1613.981,"On your Flowers point, I think Mr. Horwich said that -- that there was no doubt that 1382 applied."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1615.747,1616.73,--That's correct.
2013.12-1038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1616.73,1618.307,--in Flowers.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1618.307,1620.057,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-1038,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1637.66,1639.783,"Well, that -- that's a First Amendment case."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1667.49,1668.646,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1668.646,1671.942,"That's overburdening the easement, and this is standard stuff."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1678.456,1679.456,Your Honor--
2013.12-1038,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1679.456,1681.174,"Now, you may -- you have a First Amendment argument."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1683.579,1684.187,--Yes.
2013.12-1038,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1695.528,1697.354,You're back on the First Amendment case.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1713.395,1717.19,--Paragraph 4 says that there can be rules and regulations with regard to the easement.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.39,1732.058,"You keep sliding into the First Amendment issue, which is not the issue on which we granted certiorari."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1735.792,1741.024,"--But, Your Honor, in interpreting the statute, it must be done so as to avoid constitutional doubts."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.909,1754.612,"You can raise it, but we don't have to listen to it."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1754.612,1755.628,"--Of course, that's right."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.628,1756.784,That's -- that's what I'm saying.
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.784,1758.05,To go back to--
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1758.05,1760.831,"Of course, Your Honor, and I will address the meaning then of “ military installation ”."
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1761.643,1785.398,--The difficulty that I'm having is the Ninth Circuit said the reason that your client won is because the -- the piece of grass between the road and -- and the sign was not -- it was subject to an easement and the government lacked the exclusive right of possession.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1828.584,1833.535,"Your Honor, the question is what does the phrase “ military installation ” mean?"
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.873,1866.397,"Now, why does the First Amendment allow a person to go to the heart of the military base, put on any demonstration they want, the statute doesn't apply for the reason that, once every four months, the PG&E has an easement to go out and read the meter."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1866.397,1867.975,"--Your Honor, we would not take that position."
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1869.896,1870.74,"Now, that's exactly -- I know you wouldn't--"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1870.74,1871.162,--That's right.
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.162,1884.61,"--and that's why I want to know what your position is as to the interpretation of the statute that avoids my absurd PG&E result, but, nonetheless, does what you want, which is to protect the First Amendment interests."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1884.61,1898.792,"And I think that's exactly Justice Kennedy's question of the difference between an easement for a public road and the easement for your backyard or the easement for a utility, and that's why I don't think that the First Amendment aspect of this case can be separated from the statutory aspect."
2013.12-1038,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1898.792,1902.727,Why are you buying into the real property being the definition here at all?
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1941.68,1943.18,"No, Your Honor, I'm not."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.048,1968.173,They don't say control begins at the green light.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1981.027,1989.241,"--Your Honor, there is a big difference between the authority of the commanding officer within the close confines of the base and outside the base."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.129,2005.859,"Because -- because the commanding officer agreed to that, because that's the term of the -- of the easement."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2005.859,2009.076,"--Yes, Your Honor, but I will go back to what Justice Sotomayor said."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.559,2019.449,"There may well be, but is there -- is there a difference in the authority of the commanding officer?"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2017.84,2029.49,"Well, under the memorandum of understanding, the high -- the commanding officer has ceded control over that public road to the Highway Patrol -- the United States wants it both ways."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.953,2048.076,They're entitled to have it both ways.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2059.557,2062.26,"But, Your Honor, they shouldn't have it both ways."
2013.12-1038,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2069.427,2070.63,"Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, does that mean--"
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2070.63,2082.283,"So you raised a -- you -- you mentioned the green line, and Mr. Horwich represented some facts about it outside the record, quite properly alerted us that it was outside the record, I just want to give you a chance to respond to that."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2082.283,2083.141,Sure.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.221,2137.23,"But if -- if your colleague is correct, that the green line marked the edge of the easement, it would be entirely proper not to -- not to arrest him for violating the base until he left the easement; that is, when he crossed the green line."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2145.726,2146.992,"No, it's not--"
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.992,2149.005,It marks the end of the easement.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2149.005,2150.629,"--Well, you're absolutely right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2171.435,2177.088,"--Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, does that mean that the -- the government could not have issued this barment order in the first place?"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2177.088,2180.04,"--No, Your Honor, we do not challenge the barment order."
2013.12-1038,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2180.04,2200.423,"Well, then I'm -- I'm perplexed because if the government has sufficient commanding authority to issue the barment order to say, notwithstanding that Mr. Apel had not crossed the green line, that -- you know, he just can't be here, and he's excluded, then why don't they have sufficient authority to prevent him from reentering?"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2200.423,2211.527,"In both of the instances that led to barment orders, he crossed that green line that was on the military base side, and if he does that, then 1382 applies."
2013.12-1038,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2211.527,2212.979,I see.
2013.12-1038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2213.433,2235.268,"But the -- but the barment order that Mr. Horwich just read to us says that he can use the road, but that's not -- because the road is outside the statute, that's because the government, as a matter of grace, said right in the order, right in the bar order, you can use the road."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2258.04,2265.741,"Your Honor, there is a difference between the road and the area within the green line."
2013.12-1038,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2273.005,2278.283,"--But you're saying that if he had not crossed the green line, he could not have been excluded?"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2278.283,2279.486,That's correct.
2013.12-1038,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2279.486,2286.373,And you're saying that the military cannot exclude any person from any of this area outside the green line?
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2286.373,2287.013,That's correct.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.496,2297.932,So we're back to the real estate test.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2302.133,2307.646,Our brief very much doubts the exclusive possession test.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2307.646,2308.256,"Oh, okay."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2308.256,2311.849,"Though I do believe, as Justice Sotomayor said, there's a functional reason for this."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.347,2318.111,So you're defending the Ninth Circuit's?
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2318.111,2319.361,--We're very much defending--
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.361,2320.345,"Oh, that's what I don't understand."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2405.967,2409.497,--And I think the functional approach that Justice Sotomayor suggested is exactly that.
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.497,2410.216,"And what is that, in your view?"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2410.216,2419.072,"I think, here, it is the area that the United States government has determined by where it's built a fence and drawn the green line, that it has exclusive possession."
2013.12-1038,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2419.072,2422.603,"Really, Mr. Chemerinsky, I don't mean to interrupt your sentence."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2444.812,2444.842,No.
2013.12-1038,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2480.797,2483.813,"What do you mean by, “ exclusive possession ”?"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2487.811,2496.714,"--Well, the fence is tremendously relevant, in determining where the government believes the military installation begins, and also, it's very important in terms of national security."
2013.12-1038,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2496.714,2498.135,But there are bases that have no fences.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2503.805,2504.571,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2545.619,2550.133,I'm still completely confused about the test that you are asking us to -- to apply.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2566.828,2573.06,"--Obviously, the fence is significant, in terms of answering the government's concerns with regard to national security."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.215,2581.354,Excuse me.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2588.742,2590.132,--Well--
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.132,2591.585,Is that okay?
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2593.552,2595.38,"--But what's interesting, as was pointed out--"
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.38,2597.582,"Yes or no, under your theory?"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2597.582,2599.285,--The government does not have not exclusive possession there.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2616.342,2622.074,"That may be very bad, but is it bad because the government does not have exclusive possession of every--"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2622.074,2622.465,--Yes.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.465,2626.853,"--You know, when you talk about the road, they've given an easement, so you can say, oh, yeah, they don't have exclusive possession."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2634.82,2636.601,The government does not have exclusive possession.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.349,2639.395,Then the word “ possession ” means nothing.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2649.485,2654.015,"--But, Your Honor, Congress didn't, in 1382, say,"
2013.12-1038,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2681.755,2682.552,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2735.094,2740.843,It is where the United States chooses to exercise exclusive possession.
2013.12-1038,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2766.393,2773.032,So that -- that road for the public utility for which there is an easement of travel is not exclusive to the U.S.?
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2775.907,2784.186,"No, Your Honor, because in order to come on to that utility easement, you would need the express permission of the base commander."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.591,2790.466,You need the express permission of the base commander to drive down the road.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2796.137,2801.992,"Well, Your Honor, everyone has the authority to drive down that road."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2802.883,2808.741,Because it's been ceded by the United States for the convenience of the traveling public.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2808.741,2809.725,--Exactly.
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2822.735,2835.449,"I thought you just answered the question from Justice Sotomayor by saying, no, no, the utility easement doesn't work because the military commander has not granted permission to anybody else to use that easement."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2850.85,2852.333,--And this goes to Justice Kennedy's question earlier if we are talking about an easement.
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.042,2880.008,It seems to me a First Amendment argument and not an argument that goes to the scope of Section 1382.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2880.008,2884.709,"No, Your Honor, because you need to interpret the statute to avoid the constitutional issues."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.471,2899.702,So you are saying we should read the statute to say it only applies when it doesn't violate the First Amendment.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2901.546,2903.389,"Of course, you should read it that way."
2013.12-1038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.389,2908.308,But not because it has anything to do with the scope of authority of the government.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2920.461,2922.039,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2932.692,2953.948,"Well, you are arguing that the military cannot grant an easement across a military installation for the purpose of allowing the public to drive from a point, let's say, to the south to a point to the north, without also granting an easement that would allow people to linger along the road and engage in First Amendment activity."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2954.963,2955.354,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2955.354,2963.633,"Because I can understand why the military might be willing to say, well, fine, we understand that it would be very inconvenient to make everybody drive around the installation."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,2971.473,2973.223,"No, Your Honor, that is not my position."
2013.12-1038,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2987.247,2993.042,"Your -- your argument is sort of a use it or lose it argument, is that correct?"
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3001.382,3003.491,"Well, in a sense, yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3020.92,3026.606,"One of the arguments that the government makes is, look, what the military wants to do here is something very sensible."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3043.146,3054.922,"--Your Honor, what's wrong with that is there is no need to exclude peaceful protesters from the public road in a protest zone in order to achieve the national security interest of the government."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3054.922,3056.469,"Well, that's usually the sort of determination that's left to the military commander."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3065.138,3066.638,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3079.6,3088.534,"Well, it indicates, as the -- the barment order does, that he does see some kind of threat by allowing somebody in there who's vandalized the base in the past."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3088.534,3096.985,"Your Honor, but we -- this Court has never said there's a permanent forfeiture of First Amendment rights because somebody misbehaved at one time."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3096.985,3098.78,Is there -- can there be a temporary forfeiture of First Amendment rights?
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3098.78,3100.623,Of course there can be.
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3104.543,3105.965,"Well, I'm talking about what this case is about, which is the temporary exclusion."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3112.384,3118.897,"Well, he can be barred from coming onto the base, as drawn by the green line, for one year of--"
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3118.897,3119.787,"No, he can traverse it."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3127.363,3128.487,"--Yes, Your Honor, a sentence could include that."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3135.359,3143.653,"Now here, as I understand it, he was barred permanently subject to the right of him to apply for removal of the barment."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3143.653,3145.089,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.963,3148.807,It's more than that.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3174.345,3178.579,He can ask the commander of the base who issued the bar order for permission to use it.
2013.12-1038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3179.39,3181.28,--Do we have to get into any of that?
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3191.574,3191.588,--But they're also relevant to the statute.
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3197.259,3200.821,To avoid -- just to interrupt -- to avoid grave constitutional doubts.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3200.821,3203.412,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3228.402,3231.573,"I'm sorry, the Rule of Lenity you said in favor of a criminal defendant."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3231.573,3232.118,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3232.118,3233.931,We're talking about barment here.
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3235.461,3238.351,1382 is the criminal statute that he was convicted of violating.
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3238.351,3244.441,"Right, but this doesn't -- you're not allowed to collaterally attack the barment decision."
2013.12-1038,1,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3244.441,3245.706,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1038,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3269.183,3270.418,"Thank you, counsel."

2013.12-1038,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3461.357,3464.06,"May I just ask a background question, Mr. Horwich?"
2013.12-1038,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3470.479,3476.102,There was a settlement of litigation with the commander in the late 1980s.
2013.12-1038,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3489.301,3495.407,"Was the litigation essentially like this one, basically saying that this was not under military command?"
2013.12-1038,2,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3495.407,3500.967,"--To be honest, I'm not familiar with the particular legal contentions there."
