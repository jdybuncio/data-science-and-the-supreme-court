1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.389,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-8653, Kevin D. Gray v. Maryland."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,54.797,57.008,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.471,149.879,"Mr. Delano, do you take the view that if this had been redacted a little differently, so that it didn't show deletion and so that it said, for example, who was in the group that beat Stacey... if it just said, me and a few other guys, for example, that would be okay?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,149.879,152.651,"I do not take that position, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.651,158.415,You don't think there's any way this could have been redacted that would satisfy you.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,158.415,160.085,"Oh, I disagree."
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.687,162.539,What do you disagree with?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,162.539,170.603,--I disagree that it could have been redacted to allow in the simple statement that I hit and I struck the victim.
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,172.444,176.297,"But you don't think it could be redacted to say, me and a few other guys."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,176.297,177.587,"--I don't believe that is necessary, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.587,180.559,"Well, I'm not asking whether it's necessary."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,184.141,185.202,It should not be--
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.202,191.267,"--and it looks to me like that doesn't point to anybody, if you say, me and a few other guys."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,191.267,193.568,--It does not point to a specific person.
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.568,193.788,No.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,193.788,195.088,What it does--
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.088,206.685,"And the evidence in this case showed there was quite a gang of men who were involved, somehow, or who at least confronted Stacey at one point."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,206.685,208.487,--In this case it would not--
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.487,210.248,Only two were charged.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,210.248,214.552,"--In this case, Justice O'Connor, it would not have been extremely prejudicial."
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.552,214.852,No.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,214.852,220.746,"But the point I'm trying to make is, that evidence served no legitimate purpose."
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.987,226.98,What evidence served no legitimate purpose?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,226.98,231.572,That several other witnesses were... several other persons were involved.
1997.96-8653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.097,255.809,"Well, don't you think it would unduly favor your client if all they introduce is a statement that, you know, I beat him up, so it looks as though there wasn't a crowd of people, and the jury looks at your client, or at the other defendant and says, gee, I guess he did it, and looks at your client and says, according to this fellow there was nobody else there."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,258.209,263.764,"Justice Scalia, my position would have to be that it is unnecessary."
1997.96-8653,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,270.748,273.831,"Mr. Delano, why must it... must your position--"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,299.687,303.6,"--Under the facts of this case, Justice Ginsburg, it doesn't make a difference."
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.371,304.65,"It doesn't, you say?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,304.65,306.662,"--It's not a significant difference, no."
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.166,318.871,But you said a moment ago that if some... the... it wasn't necessary for the statement.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,318.871,319.101,--It is not.
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.101,323.433,And where does that figure into the Bruton Marsh calculus?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,331.6,340.355,Under Bruton and Marsh the attention seems to be focused towards the end of the process in terms of using a limiting instruction to--
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.355,344.286,There was no analysis at all of necessity.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,344.286,349.191,"--There is... in those particular cases there is no analysis of necessity, that is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.191,350.28,So why do you bring it up here?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,352.904,375.167,"No, I'm not asking... I'm trying to put it in a context that's... that would show that although in this case it may not be necessary for the resolution of this case, because the thrust of my argument is the use of the term deleted and deletion, that the use of what this... the respondent refers to as neutral pronouns is very misleading."
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.719,406.818,"Well, why do you say, unnecessarily?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,414.593,417.955,It's unnecessary because it serves really no legitimate purpose.
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.414,420.347,"Well, but where do you get that analysis from?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,428.492,443.482,--As I understand... the reason for my position is that the parts that are properly admitted are admitted because they incriminate the maker of the statement.
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.94,456.932,"Well, but you can't make it--"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,466.91,467.989,Only a limited--
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.989,471.542,And admissible as a result on that basis.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,471.542,486.421,--Your Honor's opinion in Williamson with a declaration of penal interest was very careful to limit it strictly to declarations against the interest of the party making the statement.
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.669,522.844,"Well, certainly some of it does, and I would assume, at least to that extent, it's admissible on that basis."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,522.844,523.414,That is correct.
1997.96-8653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,542.167,549.752,"I would like to go back to the very first question that Justice O'Connor had, because I want to be clear about your answer, and I'm not sure I understood it."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,568.705,572.848,"In... my position is, it should not be admitted by the trial judge."
1997.96-8653,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.942,587.788,"But does the admission of the statement, as I have described it, violate the Confrontation Clause?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,587.788,595.482,"The admission does, in my opinion, violate the Confrontation Clause because it incriminates other persons."
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,601.116,604.759,But the test is not whether it incriminates other persons.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,612.713,613.123,In--
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.123,614.586,Not other persons.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,622.49,623.031,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.031,624.672,That's the only one.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,626.631,637.89,"My answer is that the substantial risk of prejudice arose from the use of the terms, deleted and deletion."
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.89,638.769,Prejudice to whom?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,638.769,639.771,Prejudice to the petitioner.
1997.96-8653,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,641.842,655.422,"Okay, and you agree that the risk of prejudice is a world apart, a world of difference, depending upon whether you use the word deleted or whether you use a generic term like, me and some other guys."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,657.183,658.254,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,658.254,658.645,Okay.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,658.645,667.24,"In this case, I think common experience, there's no other reason for the use of the term, deleted, other than to point to the other defendant."
1997.96-8653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.24,668.159,Why is that?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,672.242,673.214,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-8653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.214,674.293,Don't these other guys have names?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,674.293,685.891,"--The common experience, I think, of most people today is that whenever there's... as on television, there's the blip that censors a word."
1997.96-8653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.24,708.416,"But don't you... if you're talking about redacting it to, instead of putting in the blip you're putting in a brackets, and some other guys, or is this the actual statement we're talking about?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,708.416,712.607,"--This... in the statement, there were wited out spaces--"
1997.96-8653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.607,712.918,Yes.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,712.918,715.549,"--and then comma, wited out spaces and then the other information."
1997.96-8653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.549,721.473,"Well, no one suggests that instead of witing them out you could put in, bracket, and some other guys, close bracket."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,721.473,722.235,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.235,723.807,You don't know of any redactions--
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,723.807,724.408,"No, I do not."
1997.96-8653,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.408,731.602,"--I mean, redactions... that's not an option, so you either use the statement blanking out stuff, or you don't use the statement."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,734.554,736.417,That is correct.
1997.96-8653,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,736.417,736.937,Or there's a--
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,752.766,753.947,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,774.931,777.263,Was Marsh different in that respect?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,780.805,791.431,"Marsh... in Marsh the... from the reading of the statement itself you would have no idea of the... even the existence of another person, so it is quite different from this."
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,815.217,820.991,"--Well, what do you say the jury would likely infer from the word deleted?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,820.991,829.325,I think the jury would be left with no other conclusion than that it was petitioner's name and Tank's name.
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.69,837.4,And why is that?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,841.154,849.381,If... it calls to the jury's attention that a name has been removed.
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.993,862.868,"Well, but certainly there was evidence that other people, other than those who were indicted, had participated, was there not?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,862.868,866.949,"Correct, but there was no reason to delete the names of those other persons."
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.449,869.232,"Well, but the jury doesn't know that."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,873.073,893.74,"--The jury I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is aware of common usage of the word deleted, common usage of blipping on television... it's the same as when you receive... or, at least, when I receive a letter and something is blacked out on a letter."
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.183,908.168,"But here, if the jurors do sit and try to figure out what is there, they could have come to not just one but it seems to me several conclusions."
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,915.272,930.272,"The only testimony that referred to specific... there were two witnesses in this case, and both only identified... there were only two names ever used at trial, other than the... Bell, the name of petitioner, and the name of Tank."
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.523,935.906,"But wasn't there testimony that other people, although perhaps not by name, had participated?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,935.906,941.58,"There was other testimony that several other witnesses were involved, that is correct."
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,954.017,965.985,"Mr. Delano, would you tell us what you think the test is for determining a Bruton violation in these circumstances?"
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,988.99,989.711,I'm not satisfied with that test.
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1008.722,1011.066,Have we adopted a test here?
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,1016.79,1025.345,The test that the court has thus far used is the language whether it creates a substantial risk of prejudice to the other defendant.
1997.96-8653,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1026.874,1031.559,And you think that's not as strict as compelling and inevitable inference.
1997.96-8653,0,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,1031.559,1031.919,--Clearly not.
1997.96-8653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.825,1121.426,"Very well, Mr. Delano."
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1124.007,1130.752,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1142.22,1144.433,Then why are they bothering to delete it?
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1144.433,1148.495,I'm not entirely clear why they bothered to delete it.
1997.96-8653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1157.65,1175.981,"No, but isn't the juror's reasonable reaction, on hearing that, to ask the question, why are they placing this word deletion in place of whatever it was he spoke, and isn't the likely answer to that question, because it refers to this other guy in the other chair here?"
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1175.981,1178.094,"I disagree, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1185.158,1188.38,"But the juror would never say, gee, I wonder what it is?"
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1188.38,1191.372,"--A juror very well might even say, I wonder what it is."
1997.96-8653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1191.372,1193.473,"And if he did, what would he be likely to conclude?"
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1193.473,1204.33,"We think that what the juror would be likely to conclude is what the Court noted in Richardson, which is, maybe it is the name of a person, but I can't even use that--"
1997.96-8653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1204.33,1205.842,"Well, they take it that it's the name of a person, don't they?"
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1205.842,1207.222,"--Well, it could be--"
1997.96-8653,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1207.222,1210.374,"I mean, doesn't the context make that clear beyond doubt?"
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1210.374,1212.217,"--Perhaps in this case, Your Honor--"
1997.96-8653,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.217,1215.268,This is a really slow jury if they can't figure out these are names of people.
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1215.559,1217.389,--But let me give you an example.
1997.96-8653,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.336,1236.513,"Well, isn't that... I mean, what's a jury supposed to think, that they deleted it because of John Smith, who's not in the courtroom, his name is in there?"
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1238.183,1245.279,"--I think... I think, Your Honor, that the jury thinks much like it thinks when there's an objection that's sustained that evidence doesn't come in."
1997.96-8653,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1271.575,1273.355,"Well, let me ask you something else."
1997.96-8653,1,20124,carmen_m_shepard,,1301.986,1303.245,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2281.942,2288.896,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2318.244,2323.56,"Oh, I think we're really talking about the fill in the blank sort of approach here for redaction."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2323.56,2326.001,--To answer that question--
1997.96-8653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2326.001,2327.521,Why don't we just eliminate that?
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2327.521,2336.397,"--Well, there would be costs to that if what you mean is a manner of redaction that would not be apparent to the jury at all, so the jury would not know that there had been any redaction at all."
1997.96-8653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2336.397,2340.32,To the extent that it's possible you avoid fill in the blanks.
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2353.467,2358.622,One could have deleted... one could have redacted this confession so that you didn't have the obvious blanks.
1997.96-8653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2403.825,2408.657,"Well, it was the... Bell and Tank I think is all that we're talking about."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2408.657,2419.213,"--I don't think the jury here, had it been inclined to speculate, would have had any reason to speculate that the names in Bell's confession happened to map on to Bell and Tank as opposed to other names in this group."
1997.96-8653,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.213,2424.326,"Except there would have been no reason to delete the names of third parties who were not involved in the courtroom, right?"
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2424.326,2436.064,"Tank was not involved in this courtroom, either, and the jury, again had it been inclined to speculate and disregard instructions, would have had no reason to surmise that... had no reason to think that Tank's name would need to be deleted."
1997.96-8653,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2459.702,2474.362,"If we find that there's a powerful, compelling inference that defendant is a person named in the confession, disagreeing with your analysis, and if we were writing on a clean slate, no Bruton, would there be any way to admit this statement?"
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2474.362,2493.902,"--I think that... I don't think that even with a slate that includes Bruton the conclusion you describe would dictate an unfavorable answer for the State here, and what I mean by that is the following."
1997.96-8653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.495,2558.165,"Mr. McLeese, what's the worst kind of a different situation in which we trust the jury to obey an instruction from the judge not to consider what it has just heard."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2558.546,2560.286,Two cases come--
1997.96-8653,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.286,2562.109,--Give me another example that's as bad as this.
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2562.109,2563.428,"--Well, two come to mind."
1997.96-8653,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.154,2606.167,"That may not be as persuasive as it might have been, because most States after that have taken a different view on separating sentencing from guilt just because of the obvious risk of prejudice in that very situation, so you sort of have a general consensus that that case, maybe there was no constitutional violation, but there was obvious unfairness there."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2606.167,2617.343,"--But the relevant inquiry here is whether the risk of jury inability to set aside incriminating evidence is a constitutional violation, and what Spencer v. Texas said, whatever jurisdiction--"
1997.96-8653,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2617.343,2626.229,"Well, if they do... no doubt about the fact, if they did treat this as admissible against the codefendant it would be a blatant constitutional violation."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2627.0,2627.812,--I do agree with that.
1997.96-8653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.356,2657.398,So what is the... you can't substitute for the defendant's name a concrete description.
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2661.351,2662.403,--No.
1997.96-8653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2663.422,2663.672,All right.
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2682.606,2689.14,--The rule we propose is limited to confessions which do not contain additional descriptive information of the kind that you suggest.
1997.96-8653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2689.14,2710.894,"Why, in fact... I think one argument is that a blank separated by commas in the circumstance is quite close to a particular description because it sets the jury to thinking, and they see blank, blank, and some other guys, and they know who that is just as if it said, the red haired man with the limp."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2710.894,2712.086,In this case--
1997.96-8653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.086,2714.487,So what's the test to decide whether they're right or not?
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2721.102,2727.186,"--With respect to confessions, confessions that are... even as redacted contain additional descriptive information."
1997.96-8653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.621,2744.586,"--Vivid and obvious, and if not that, if we accepted their view, are there many, many retrials that would be necessary throughout the country?"
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2756.775,2769.284,"--I think that that is a widely... redaction that would be apparent to the jury, perhaps, but that deletes the names, is a relatively common practice in the State and Federal system."
1997.96-8653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2769.284,2776.096,"Well, where you say, physically, deletion, deletion, as opposed to simply leaving it out--"
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2776.096,2778.347,That is less clear.
1997.96-8653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2778.347,2786.565,"--so that it says me and other guys, instead of me, deletion, deletion, and a bunch of other guys?"
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2786.565,2787.433,That is less clear.
1997.96-8653,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2788.455,2788.725,We don't know.
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2788.725,2791.176,--It's very hard to tell how common a practice that is.
1997.96-8653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2791.176,2798.773,I would assume... is it fair to assume that if you thought this practice were common you would have told us that?
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2800.313,2801.963,"If I were aware that it were common, I certainly would have."
1997.96-8653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.963,2804.547,--So people haven't been complaining to you about it.
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2814.601,2816.083,That is... when you say this is not a common practice--
1997.96-8653,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.083,2817.904,"The use of the word deletion, deletion."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2817.904,2824.7,--In the Federal system there certainly is not a lot of lower court case law addressing that particular method of redaction.
1997.96-8653,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2825.481,2837.198,"Could that be because of the warning that this Court gave in Marsh, the footnote that says, we express no opinion on the admissibility of a confession in which the defendant's name has been replaced with a symbol?"
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2837.198,2855.918,"--I should be clear that, on the other hand, redactions that continue to describe the role of the unnamed other participants by use of terms other than deletion, like the other guy, or him, that is an extremely common practice in the Federal courts areas and has met widespread acceptance in the lower Federal courts."
1997.96-8653,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2859.882,2872.12,"But I think when Justice O'Connor started reading how this might have been presented and she said, me and a few other guys, that is a distinction from me and delete, delete."
1997.96-8653,2,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2872.12,2873.45,That's true.
1997.96-8653,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.701,2880.696,"Thank you, Mr. McLeese."
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,2884.677,2888.58,"Your Honor, in answer to--"
1997.96-8653,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2888.58,2892.032,"Is the proper pronunciation of your name Delano, or Delano?"
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,2892.032,2895.245,"--That's a source of confusion even within my own family, but--"
1997.96-8653,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.597,2899.088,Delano.
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,2899.088,2926.806,"In answer to the Court's question about whether this was preserved or not, counsel at the end of the hearing on the admissibility of the statement clearly indicated that they objected to this statement as admitted, and clearly pointed out to the court that the statement as redacted strengthened the case of... against petitioner."
1997.96-8653,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.806,2936.213,"But was objection made on the non Bruton ground that it just was a violation of, perhaps the Confrontation Clause on some other basis?"
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,2936.213,2936.904,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2987.817,2988.889,How are they supposed to do it?
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3001.575,3006.36,--I would suppose that the piece of paper would have to be retyped or rewritten.
1997.96-8653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3006.36,3008.411,But then you can't submit the original.
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3008.411,3010.751,Perhaps you might not be able to submit the original.
1997.96-8653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3010.751,3011.613,"Well, what do you... when you say perhaps, I mean--"
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3011.613,3011.903,Well--
1997.96-8653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3011.903,3014.095,--what precisely do you think is supposed to happen?
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3014.095,3018.447,"--If it showed a blank space, you would not be able to present the original."
1997.96-8653,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3036.798,3038.2,Who would testify?
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3038.2,3041.052,"The officer... as in this case, the officer who took the statement."
1997.96-8653,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3046.074,3051.638,And he would testify and slightly modify what he actually heard.
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3051.638,3052.039,Yes.
1997.96-8653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.503,3071.192,"Is it the case, going to be the case when we get into this record and so forth we'll find that you didn't... there's no one suggesting that the way to do this is to simply read the confession and leave the names out?"
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3071.192,3072.742,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-8653,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.742,3077.584,"How are we supposed to deal with that, that this alternative wasn't presented to the judge?"
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3077.584,3099.861,"Under Maryland evidentiary law the Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals were of the mind that this issue had been preserved and again, the issue had not been presented by respondent in any form of a cross petition, so I don't believe that that's necessary for the Court to reach that issue."
1997.96-8653,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3106.256,3117.091,"You're telling us that when we go to the objection what we will find is something that says in so many words the confession ought to be kept out because this is not good enough under Bruton, something like that, is that what--"
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3117.091,3118.573,The objection was entirely under Bruton.
1997.96-8653,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3136.065,3140.978,"--So that the only thing you didn't do was get up and say, I'll tell you how to do it right."
1997.96-8653,3,15869,arthur_a_delano_jr,,3140.978,3141.509,That is correct.
1997.96-8653,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3195.225,3197.769,"Thank you, Mr. Delano."
