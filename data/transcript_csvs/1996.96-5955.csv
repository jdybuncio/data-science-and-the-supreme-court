1996.96-5955,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-5955, Steiney Richards v. Wisconsin."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,13.891,42.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-5955,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,62.323,64.556,"This fellow was actually in a motel room, wasn't he?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,64.556,83.404,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I fully agree, and as one who has been a resident of a hotel recently I would submit that it is the longstanding doctrine of this Court that a hotel room is a home for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment under Stoner v. California--"
1996.96-5955,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,83.404,86.189,Is there a case that says a motel room is a home?
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,86.189,92.176,"--I believe Stoner v. California, U.S.... United States v. Jeffers, United States v.--"
1996.96-5955,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.176,98.747,I agree with you those cases said that a hotel room is protected by the Fourth Amendment.
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,101.949,114.19,"--I... Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that those stand for the proposition that the hotel room has the same protection as a home."
1996.96-5955,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.725,125.712,"I think that's probably correct, but to say... when you say that a motel room... we're talking here about the sanctity of the home."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,131.032,133.068,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.068,134.851,"The Fourth Amendment doesn't mention homes anyway, does it?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,134.851,136.287,It mentions--
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.287,142.423,"The right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, so I guess the real issue is whether a hotel room is a house."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,144.875,158.95,"--Justice Scalia, I believe that the textual use of house is not referring to the... protecting the structure but rather what occurs inside the house."
1996.96-5955,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,213.437,224.809,"Mr. Karpe, on that striking feature of this case, here it was the affidavit of the police with... asking for permission for no-knock, and the United States struck that out."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,235.831,249.174,"--I have seen a number of different forms of applications for search warrants, Justice Ginsburg, and sometimes there's check-off boxes."
1996.96-5955,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.284,274.622,"What I'm asking, maybe you don't know the answer to this question, is, is it standard operating procedure in Wisconsin for the police to ask for no-knock permission?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,274.622,277.841,"--Justice Ginsburg, I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question."
1996.96-5955,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.763,289.965,"As a matter of practice, do police... is this a common form of affidavit?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,291.334,293.334,"--Often they do that, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-5955,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.334,298.488,"And is it also often that the judge X's it out, the magistrate X's it out?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,298.488,299.654,"I cannot speak to that, Justice--"
1996.96-5955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.654,309.344,"Would it be a fair interpretation to say that the judge instructed the officers that they must knock, and failure to do so was therefore a violation of the warrant?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,309.344,314.062,"--Justice Kennedy, I hope I'm understanding your question correctly, but by--"
1996.96-5955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.062,317.331,"By striking it out, does that mean that they must knock?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,317.331,329.739,"--I believe that was Judge Frankel's intention, that his review of the facts presented to him did not present that it would be reasonable--"
1996.96-5955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.739,331.405,"Of course, that's not really in this case."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,368.947,379.47,"--Justice O'Connor, the way I understand the question, I think that the pre-approval would not necessarily make the search reasonable."
1996.96-5955,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,386.374,388.659,I take it the converse would be true.
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,404.418,405.885,"Granted, Justice--"
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.885,417.326,"Or even if they don't hear guns being fired, if they hear nothing but what the court expected them to hear, the court might have just been wrong, isn't that right, as to whether it would violate the Constitution?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,417.326,431.967,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, which is why it's so important that there not be a blanket exception that basically removes the judicial process and has law enforcement then acting in a way unfettered by legal process."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.371,444.108,"But, gee, that happens a lot of times with searches and seizures."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,458.784,463.736,"Yes, Justice Scalia, but hopefully reviewable by a court."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.736,465.354,Okay.
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,468.223,474.025,"The blanket exception makes it, Justice Scalia, a very simplistic process."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.077,480.627,--What about automobiles?
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,485.664,496.539,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, and I don't... the Founders didn't include in the Fourth Amendment that we had a right to be secure in our carriages or whatever."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.872,502.872,I like that.
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,505.324,515.763,"--In this area, we would submit that a blanket rule would never be acceptable with regard to unannounced entries."
1996.96-5955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.215,526.487,"We recently announced a blanket rule, did we not, in, I believe it's Maryland v. Wilson, with reference to people stepping out of automobiles."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,529.772,536.176,"--Justice Kennedy, I agree that that did set a blanket rule, but--"
1996.96-5955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,536.176,537.726,So there are blanket rules.
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,537.726,541.58,--Apart... but that was a very de minimis sort of intrusion.
1996.96-5955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.048,548.4,"Well, that could be major."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,556.737,566.176,The Court had already ruled in Pennsylvania v. Mimms that asking the driver to step out under the same circumstances was de minimis.
1996.96-5955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,604.984,612.955,"Well, it's dangerous even with a knock and announce as well, I assume, in situations like this where there's a drug dealer with weapons."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,626.215,631.118,"Justice O'Connor, there was no indication that Steiney Richards had weapons."
1996.96-5955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.986,637.986,You were speaking in generalities--
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,637.986,638.169,Yes.
1996.96-5955,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.169,638.938,--and so was I.
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,638.938,641.188,"Yes, but--"
1996.96-5955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.188,642.306,"He jumped out the window, didn't he?"
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,646.342,647.308,"--Well, I think--"
1996.96-5955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,647.308,648.294,Is that a legitimate concern?
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,648.294,652.412,"--Justice Breyer, I think it's ambiguous that he knew that that was police."
1996.96-5955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,653.546,654.948,Did he just jump out the window for fun?
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,654.948,656.65,--He knew someone was trying to bang the door down.
1996.96-5955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.687,670.139,I take it that... right.
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,703.026,710.097,"Justice Breyer, there is certainly no indication that Mr. Richards was going to attempt to destroy drugs, and certainly the way they were packaged he would have had a heck of a time."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,776.186,786.661,"Once again, I'd rather be inclined to rely on the judgment of the officers as to what is more or less likely to endanger their lives."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,803.687,806.972,"--Justice Scalia, I agree, the Fourth Amendment is not there to protect Government."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.622,820.93,"So I mean, this argument you've been dwelling on that, you know, it's going to hurt the police officers more, I... you know, it's sort of... I don't see it."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,829.786,843.343,"Justice Scalia, I don't think there's any indication that in fact it is more dangerous to the police to announce."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.176,847.378,"Well, the State says so."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,856.251,880.266,"I... in any case... I don't... this is not really in response to your question, but in any case, in the... this Court's very well-reasoned and unanimous decision in Wilson v. Arkansas, this Court recognized the presumption in favor of announcement."
1996.96-5955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.24,894.625,"Suppose it weren't blanket, Mr Karpe."
1996.96-5955,0,21064,david_r_karpe,,937.648,942.652,"Justice Scalia, again, that... the presumption there is going the wrong way."
1996.96-5955,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1528.43,1539.052,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-5955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.146,1634.931,"General Doyle-- --How long do you wait after announce and a knock, a knock and announce?"
1996.96-5955,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1640.585,1646.406,"We... in Wisconsin... it depends somewhat on the circumstances, the size of the room."
1996.96-5955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.392,1657.158,Just enough time for somebody who would hear the knock to come?
1996.96-5955,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1657.158,1658.027,That's correct.
1996.96-5955,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.027,1673.437,"General Doyle, if you're correct that the videotapes would show the same scenario regardless of whether there's a knock or no-knock, doesn't that suggest that the no-knock... that the requirement of a knock doesn't really harm the law enforcement operation?"
1996.96-5955,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1673.437,1690.148,"It harms law enforcement enormously, because in circumstances, and we would argue in drug-dealing cases, because that knock and announce, it's 10 to 15 seconds of waiting, and then it's however long a time it takes to get organized then to come through the door."
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2705.465,2717.606,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-5955,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.655,2743.238,"Rebus sic stantibus, right?"
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2747.356,2750.139,"--Well, that is right."
1996.96-5955,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.859,2831.693,"Mr. Estrada, one of the things that Chief Judge Abrahamson said in her concurring opinion was, well, if you're going to go by danger to the police officer, more police officers are killed responding to calls, domestic violence calls than in drug raids, so if it's danger to the police officer and you could have a blanket rule for drug raids, why not a blanket rule for domestic violence situations?"
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2831.693,2843.818,"--Well, I don't know that there is any reason to think that in those particular cases the manner of entry makes any difference."
1996.96-5955,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2888.445,2898.57,"But what about the statistics that inform the officer, if you're going to respond to one of those calls, you're walking into a very dangerous situation where your life is going to be on the line."
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2898.57,2915.58,"Well, that may be true, but it is not... and just to put our point in context, our point in this case is that that may have significance in the officer's reasonable conduct."
1996.96-5955,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2921.431,2926.869,But I'm just wondering why we can't have blanket rules for all these dangerous situations.
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2935.475,2967.946,"--It may be the case that there are other cases in which similar... in which a similar rule is warranted, Justice Ginsburg, but I think that the class of cases that we have here are significant in that we have the courts all over the country telling this Court that this is a class of cases in which there is a remarkable danger of violence, and a high danger that the evidence will be destroyed, and this Court--"
1996.96-5955,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.946,2973.498,You also identify... you have a warrant issued by a magistrate.
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2973.498,2982.354,"--Well, that's right, and as I pointed out earlier in that other class of cases it is likely to be the case that the fundamental intrusion into the home has not been authorized."
1996.96-5955,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2982.354,2986.306,"You are suggesting a general standard, not a per se rule."
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2990.591,2992.96,"That is right, Justice Kennedy."
1996.96-5955,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3016.825,3023.229,"Well, you're not supporting the Wisconsin rule in any event, the Wisconsin supreme court per se rule."
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3023.229,3023.812,"No, we're not."
1996.96-5955,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3023.812,3035.62,And would you support the rule if we were only dealing with situations where the magistrate had specifically determined they should enter without knocking?
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3037.103,3044.725,"That is not a course that as I read this Court's cases is open to the Court, because it was an argument that was made in the Dalia case."
1996.96-5955,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3044.725,3050.629,So the statutes in Nebraska and Utah to that effect presumably are invalid?
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3050.629,3050.879,No.
1996.96-5955,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3083.516,3092.872,"Yes, but what about those States that do, by statute, provide that the magistrate will consider and determine whether or not there can be a no-knock entry?"
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3099.442,3113.1,"--It is... it likely is, if the judge has made a finding that that is a course that is warranted in the circumstances."
1996.96-5955,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3127.026,3140.834,"I'm curious to know, if the magistrate makes the determination that you must knock, directs the officer to knock as part of the warrant, and the officers see something that they think overrides the judgment, and they don't knock, that does not necessarily invalidate the search, does it?"
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3140.834,3147.689,"That is right, and let me take that as an opportunity to answer something that Mr. Karpe said."
1996.96-5955,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.872,3214.715,"Mr. Estrada, what do you do about General Doyle's concern that it's fine to have this general rule, but it will always be controverted at the exclusion hearing, where the defendant will come in and say, well, you knew that we didn't have... you knew that we didn't have weapons."
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3214.715,3229.324,"--Well, I think that in our view someone would not be entitled to a hearing unless he can point to objectively ascertainable facts that indicate that prima facie at least the conduct was clearly unreasonable."
1996.96-5955,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3248.305,3250.171,"Well, what does that require to show, that we didn't have weapons?"
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3251.34,3251.557,Well--
1996.96-5955,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3251.557,3253.073,"And I say, you knew it."
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3254.642,3264.831,"--Well, you would have to have a specific factual basis for the imputation that they knew it, and in the absence of that, no hearing would be required."
1996.96-5955,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3264.831,3266.7,On whom is the burden of proof?
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3266.7,3278.257,"In a search that is conducted under a search warrant, Mr. Chief Justice, the burden would be on the defendant."
1996.96-5955,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3288.529,3305.825,"Well, let me just take... say you're not in a drug case but a financial crime or something like that, and the police had a warrant, went in without knocking or announcing, and the defendant proved just that, that this was a financial crimes case, and they came in with a warrant, but they did not knock and announce."
1996.96-5955,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3307.641,3309.474,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
