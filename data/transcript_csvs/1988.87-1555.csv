1988.87-1555,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.856,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1555, James J. Burnley v. Labor Railway Labor Executives' Association."
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,17.712,22.763,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1555,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,148.262,156.333,"Mr. Attorney General... Mr. Attorney General, does that legislation and those regulations prohibit the use of alcohol by railroad employees?"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,156.333,171.295,"--The 1907 Act did not deal with that problem, and I would propose to walk us through briefly, as briefly as I can, what led up to what I submit is an authority to carry out that kind of testing--"
1988.87-1555,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,171.295,172.528,"No, I'm not asking about the testing."
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,180.151,200.731,"--They are, indeed, by operating rules adopted by nearly all railroads, Rule G, which states forth... sets forth in no uncertain terms the prohibition against working or showing up for work under the influence of alcohol or drugs and provides for dismissal in those cases."
1988.87-1555,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,200.731,206.183,What is the period of time between arrival at work and the last time they can have alcohol?
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,206.183,208.651,That would be a--
1988.87-1555,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.651,209.185,Is it governed by--
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,209.185,209.753,--a judgmental matter.
1988.87-1555,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.753,211.053,--It's not governed by regulation.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,211.053,213.789,"It is not governed by regulation to my knowledge, Your Honor, no."
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,213.789,221.395,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, what employees are subject to that prohibition?"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,223.111,224.929,"Yes, operating service employees."
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,224.929,232.75,"Well, would that include the dining car waiters?"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,232.75,233.868,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1988.87-1555,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,235.735,237.154,I can testify no.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,237.154,238.087,--You can testify no.
1988.87-1555,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,238.087,238.654,No.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,238.654,242.391,I will accept an expert witness' testimony on that.
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,253.43,254.866,"Dining car waiters, and--"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,254.866,255.349,That's my understanding.
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,255.349,256.016,"--porters, and--"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,256.016,257.318,Yes.
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,257.318,261.186,--Not just those charged with running the train.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,261.186,265.555,"Well, specifically and most importantly those charged with running the train."
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,265.555,266.989,But the others as well.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,266.989,268.289,That's my understanding.
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,271.041,272.927,I think it's rather important.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,272.927,273.76,We will undertake to--
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,273.76,274.962,At least it is for me.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,274.962,277.481,--We will undertake to tighten down on that.
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,287.253,288.237,That's the engineer.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,288.237,289.705,"--Yes, brakeman, fireman, yes."
1988.87-1555,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,289.705,290.272,Firemen.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,307.75,325.712,"The definition is under the Hours of Service Act, which includes operating employees... and I stand corrected and will revert to the practice noticed by Mr. Justice Marshall that dining car employees are not covered by the regulations--"
1988.87-1555,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.712,332.032,"Well, is it your submission that all of those employees are engaged in safety-sensitive tasks?"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,332.032,333.568,--The Hours of Service employees?
1988.87-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.201,340.555,Thank you.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,349.16,349.56,No.
1988.87-1555,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,362.301,367.705,xxx.
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,370.757,375.895,Pullman car employees.
1988.87-1555,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,375.895,380.18,"Well, they're on the train."
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,380.18,412.234,"Well, the thrust and the focus of this regulation and the regulatory scheme that has been generally promulgated with regard to railroad employees relates to those employees that have a clear and palpable relationship to the safety of the protected persons, fellow employees, traveling public, citizens and communities around it."
1988.87-1555,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.382,468.071,"Well, are you saying that if the regulation reaches employees who are not in a safety-sensitive position, then it would be invalid?"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,468.071,468.521,No.
1988.87-1555,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.106,471.356,You just say you don't think it does--
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,471.356,474.891,"--Again, with respect to those employees, there might be a... a question."
1988.87-1555,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.891,479.895,"--I think that's part of your opponent's argument, that it's broader than necessary even on your own rationale."
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,479.895,500.809,"Well, I think when you look at the regulation in its gross operation... and again, I... I don't want to represent to this Court that there may not be somewhere out there an employee or two or category that has... with respect to which Your Honor's concerns might be justified."
1988.87-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.943,528.645,"Is any such group pointed out in your opponent's briefs, do you recall?"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,532.147,540.703,"I don't, but I suspect that my opponent will scour his brief for such a designation."
1988.87-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,540.703,544.821,"General Thornburgh, as long as you're interrupted, may I change the focus of the--"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,544.821,545.355,Certainly.
1988.87-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,545.355,551.908,--questioning a minute to inquire about what happens to the reports that are received after the drug testing?
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,565.318,569.203,They could be used in either civil or criminal proceedings.
1988.87-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,571.222,586.665,Does that raise any concerns under this Court's holding in Schmerber that the evidence gathered after the crash is turned over for a subsequent criminal prosecution?
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,586.665,618.036,"I don't think so because what you're dealing with here is not some ruse to carry on a criminal investigation under the guise of an administrative proceeding, but a set of regulations that has an independent rationale and an independent basis for carrying out the responsibilities of the Federal Railway Administration to investigate accidents and to enforce the rules that are promulgated against drug and alcohol abuse."
1988.87-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.036,628.761,"Well, is the purpose to discipline the employee involved and get them out of the business of operating a dangerous instrumentality while under the influence of drugs?"
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,628.761,635.664,That is one of a number of purposes that are identified in the regulations deriving their authority from the Railway Safety Act.
1988.87-1555,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.664,643.936,How would it affect that goal if there were some prohibition against turning the evidence over to the police for criminal prosecution?
1988.87-1555,0,21611,dick_thornburgh,,643.936,668.219,"I don't know that it necessarily would, Your Honor, because the purpose and focus of the FRA, as Your Honor suggests, is toward the safety portion of the Act which obviously would be enhanced by removing or in some cases rehabilitating through programs that the railroads carry out those employees who have drug and alcohol problems."
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1786.396,1789.832,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1885.794,1892.631,Do you assert that a blood test cannot show current extent of impairment from alcohol or drugs?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1892.631,1893.75,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1908.825,1912.211,"Well, can't it show, for example, blood alcohol content--"
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1912.211,1912.694,It can.
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1912.694,1913.077,--in the person?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1913.077,1913.677,Yes.
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.677,1916.296,And doesn't that relate to impairment?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1916.296,1917.265,"Yes, and the alcohol--"
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.265,1919.048,It's relevant to that inquiry.
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1919.048,1920.883,"--Yes, that's correct."
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1920.883,1922.267,How about in the drug area?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1922.267,1927.787,"In the drug area, it can show an active ingredient in the blood system, yes."
1988.87-1555,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.708,1991.896,"None of the courts that have considered this, Mr. Mann, have... even the ones who have ruled in your favor, as... as the Ninth Circuit, have suggested that the government had to obtain a warrant."
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1991.896,1992.763,--They did not.
1988.87-1555,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.121,2009.441,"The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches, so the test is reasonableness."
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2009.441,2010.675,--That's correct.
1988.87-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.485,2025.101,Excuse me.
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2056.339,2064.612,"--Your Honor, it seems that the proper focus would be using alcohol or drugs on the job."
1988.87-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.979,2068.413,Is--
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2068.413,2069.063,--usage on the job.
1988.87-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.063,2079.121,--Is not someone who uses cocaine more likely to use it on the job than someone who doesn't use cocaine?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2079.121,2080.821,I don't think that follows necessarily.
1988.87-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.821,2082.073,It doesn't?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2082.073,2082.906,Not necessarily.
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.772,2116.044,Is it your position that the public has no interest in whether or not railroad employees are chronic drug users so long as the drugs are not used while they're on the job?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2116.044,2116.527,I think it--
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2116.527,2117.496,Is that your position?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2117.496,2124.65,"--I think it's certainly the interest of the government to know who uses drugs and when, but there are other means to determine that."
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2128.035,2130.554,"So... so it... so, we do have an interest in knowing that."
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2130.554,2131.404,"--Yes, I think--"
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2131.404,2140.91,And isn't one of the reasons we want to know that because there is a likelihood or a higher probability that drugs will be used on the job if they're used off the job?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2142.212,2145.997,"--Well, that conclusion I don't necessarily agree with, sir."
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2147.681,2149.516,Could... could reasonable people disagree on that?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2149.516,2150.633,--I think so--
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2150.633,2151.233,All right.
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2155.502,2158.989,--That is certainly what the government has done in this case.
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2193.46,2211.589,"Mr. Mann, isn't there a concern about use of drugs even if it's off-duty hours so long as that usage might impair the person's capacity to operate the equipment safely when he is on the job or she is on the job?"
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2215.326,2215.993,It's the--
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.993,2228.818,"I mean, if somebody takes a drink before going in the engine of the train or has a shot of some drug immediately before or soon before, that's an equal concern, is it not?"
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2228.818,2238.608,"--It is an equal concern, Justice O'Connor, but the concern should be not what one does in their privacy of their home."
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2244.429,2252.333,"Well, the concern is what one does before going on the job that will impair the ability of the person to perform the job safely."
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2252.333,2252.649,Yes.
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2252.649,2253.285,Isn't that true?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2253.285,2255.335,"That's correct, and we agree with that."
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2255.335,2265.093,And do you think that a... the taking of... the physical taking of blood is less intrusive than a urine specimen?
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2265.093,2267.426,"I don't think it's less intrusive, no."
1988.87-1555,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2273.746,2277.316,"Then why the focus on a blood test is all right, but not a urine test?"
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2277.316,2278.5,"--No, I'm not saying that."
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2294.01,2302.449,"The urine test is better, is it not, for demonstrating traces of use over a period of time?"
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2302.449,2303.066,It can--
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2303.066,2303.984,That's how I understand the record.
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2305.251,2307.336,"--Well, so can blood, Your Honor."
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2307.336,2314.256,"Isn't urine better than blood for establishing residues over a period of, say, 30 days?"
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2316.608,2325.047,"It may be more effective, but the blood tests can also demonstrate that by the fact that in the measurement--"
1988.87-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2325.047,2325.664,Not may be more effective.
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2330.785,2333.653,"--I don't think I can honestly answer that, sir."
1988.87-1555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2333.653,2341.224,"Mr. Mann, you've spent about eight minutes or more on the difference between the urine and the blood tests."
1988.87-1555,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2342.926,2343.343,Well--
1988.87-1555,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.343,2344.961,Why are you drawing a line?
