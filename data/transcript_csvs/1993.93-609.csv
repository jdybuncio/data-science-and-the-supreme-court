1993.93-609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.37,"We'll hear argument next in No. 93-609, Morgan Stanley & Company v. Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,39.476,41.049,"It is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,41.049,42.369,Please proceed.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,42.369,45.171,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,203.786,205.056,Why... why did it overrule it?
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,212.072,215.674,"--But they can't reverse undue final judgments, Justice Souter."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,215.674,222.908,"Well, they... they didn't... you... you agree, I take it, they didn't do what... what would have been done by the Congress in Hayburn's Case."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,222.908,224.53,What they--
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,224.53,233.435,This... this was not an instance... what I'm getting at is this is not an instance in which there was an individualized action by Congress on a case-by-case basis--
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,233.435,234.237,--That's correct.
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,234.237,237.957,--To revise an otherwise ostensibly final decision of a court.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,237.957,238.998,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.998,240.299,"So, Hayburn is no authority for you, is it?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,240.299,253.338,"It... it is, Your Honor, in that Hayburn's Case treats the broader principle of the powers of the judiciary being infringed by Congress, whether or not the statute preexists or comes after the judgment at issue."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.827,270.218,"But those are final judgments which, as judgments, are being revised."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,273.72,275.002,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,275.473,281.037,"And you have... I mean, do you... you have no authority from this Court with respect to that latter proposition, do you?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,281.037,299.487,"--Your Honor, we have... we have the authority in Gordon and in O'Grady, if you will, Your Honor, which we believe hold that when any law is passed by Congress, whether it be new or old, it cannot... it cannot infringe upon a final judgment which has been rendered by this Court."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.487,303.872,"Mr. Benkard, why do you concede that no... no judgment has been revised by the statute?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,305.751,306.853,"Your Honor, forgive me."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.804,308.283,I thought you did.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,311.936,312.417,"--Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.128,313.488,It certainly did.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,313.488,313.759,"Oh, no, sir."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.759,314.657,"It wiped out judgments that were on the books, didn't it?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,314.657,316.82,"The devil has my lips, Your Honor."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.82,317.74,"No, I think what--"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,318.692,319.413,I... I--
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,319.413,323.844,"--Mr. Benkard, I think the... I think the devil... I don't think it's your lips the devil has got here."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,330.588,331.109,--That is correct.
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,331.109,332.198,--Revised something.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,332.198,336.593,"But they have revised these judgments, as Justice Scalia has pointed out."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,336.593,348.271,"But... but in... in Hayburn's Case, it was clear, at the time that the Court was asked to resolve the dispute, that the judgment would and could be revised by the Congress."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,358.048,362.409,"Well, the dispute... the dispute in... in this case, Your Honor, or in Hayburn's?"
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.409,363.721,In your... in our case.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,363.721,370.056,"The case was... was, in essence, over before section 27A was enacted."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,370.056,377.449,And so the Court could give its determination without fear of Congress revising it on the basis that the Court decided it?
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,377.449,379.279,That is correct.
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,379.279,382.083,"And that is the difference between this case and Hayburn's, is it not?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,382.083,383.042,"That... there's no question, Your Honor."
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,411.961,417.116,"Mr. Benkard, you're talking about the timing of the legislation."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,455.841,456.41,Correct.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.963,463.185,--The... but the actuality is what?
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,467.348,467.938,Correct.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,467.938,478.857,"Is it not so that as between the judiciary and the legislature, statutes of limitations are in the legislature... legislature's court?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,491.893,492.664,Correct.
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,514.981,516.289,That's your due process argument.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,517.572,519.054,"--But... it may be, Your Honor--"
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,519.054,522.035,"Let's stay on the separation of powers argument for the moment, if you would."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,522.035,522.895,--I certainly will.
1993.93-609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.394,555.035,"Well, how... how about Rule 60, which--"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,555.035,555.987,--Rule 60 being?
1993.93-609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.987,559.58,--Which authorizes the setting aside of judgments within a certain time period.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,561.891,563.591,"But it is for you to do, Your Honors."
1993.93-609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,590.081,597.925,"Well, but here... here Congress has simply provided that the judiciary shall judge whether or not a new statute of limitations applies, and then decide the case on the merits."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,597.925,606.741,"--If I may segue then, they have in fact operated, as I believe you pointed out in your dissent in Sioux Nation, they have operated as an appellate court."
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,618.528,639.963,"The fact that you... you recognize the distinction, and I think you were quite candid to do so, between deciding the merits of the a case... does the claimant... is the claimant entitled to a pension of benefit of some kind, and a question of time, where we agree that time is for the legislature... statute of limitations have legislative decision written all over them."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,660.215,662.426,"I do not think it is the same kind of claim, Your Honor."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.971,668.3,"Oh, that's it."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,670.221,670.962,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.962,676.074,If Justice Ginsburg is talking about a claim that has expired without a lawsuit having been brought--
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,676.074,676.555,Correct.
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.897,679.277,--Right.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,679.277,680.529,We know it from a variety of cases.
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.529,686.713,"And you would distinguish that from case where the statute, having expired, a suit is brought and dismissed on the basis of the statute; that's a different situation?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,686.713,687.124,Absolutely.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,692.057,695.98,"So, it's just the holiness of the judgment that you're relying on, that--"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,695.98,696.807,That's--
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.807,697.999,--A judgment can't--
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,697.999,698.56,--Absolutely.
1993.93-609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.814,741.767,"--Well, we've told Congress the stat... that, in effect, that its statute is broken."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,743.778,744.429,Fine.
1993.93-609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.322,751.295,But it seems to me they can do that without interfering with the courts.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,757.79,758.541,--You--
1993.93-609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.541,760.234,And no one quarrels with that.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,761.683,763.476,--It is final--
1993.93-609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,763.476,769.501,The point is that Congress can alter that without demeaning or interfering with this Court.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,769.501,770.759,--It--
1993.93-609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,770.759,773.681,And it should do so if it desires a different result.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,776.744,777.225,--Yes.
1993.93-609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.225,780.716,"But so far as the separation of powers question, I see no interference."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,780.716,784.627,"Well, I... I, with the greatest respect, I see all the interference in the world."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.165,833.38,"Mr. Benkard, I... I assume that, for purposes of this case, you... you would... you can concede that it'd be a different matter if Congress simply passed a longer statute of limitations which would allow people who... even people who had already sued and been denied because of the old statute of limitations to bring a new suit... raising a res judicata issue, but that's a different issue?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,837.163,838.202,"Wait... no, wait a minute--"
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.202,840.495,--Must you assert that it's the same one for the purpose of this case?
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,840.495,841.255,--I'm not sure I have to.
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.634,855.066,I think that's a harder question than... than--
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,855.066,855.476,--Much.
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.235,860.528,"--Congress setting aside a judgment of the court, which is... which is what happened here."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,861.677,862.238,--Absolutely.
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.238,863.35,It said the case will be reopened.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,863.35,864.391,I say it can't do it.
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.391,865.992,Don't... you don't think that's a harder question than--
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,865.992,867.442,I do think it's a harder question.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,915.614,921.587,--But there's one point on the due process side that I'd like you to address.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,946.264,947.213,--Right.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,947.213,950.017,"--Then those people have no due process rights, I take it?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,950.017,951.828,"When you say, those people have no--"
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.828,958.032,"The people who deliberately prolonged protracted litigation, instead of accepting the dismissal."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,969.579,970.33,--Mm-hm.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,970.33,978.335,Congress responded to that disappointment and provided for two things: cases still in the pipeline--
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,978.335,981.788,I understand.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,993.175,998.128,"--So, then we're dealing with the people who are unsophisticated, rather than the people who protract it--"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,998.128,999.209,--Well--
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,999.209,1021.462,"--The people who are unsophisticated, those plaintiffs who didn't take that protective appeal or cautious appeal... to characterize it in a non-pejorative way... those people, the sophisticated, will... those plaintiffs will succeed, whereas the ones who just accepted the dismissal lose?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1021.462,1032.54,"--I don't want to fence with you, Your Honor, but a lot of sophisticated and unsophisticated people took appeals here during the pendency of the discussions in Congress concerning 27A."
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1065.812,1070.535,"But the court... courts can do that, as you conceded, all the time under 60(b)6."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1070.535,1071.425,--Courts can do it.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1071.425,1076.26,"For any of the reasons of just and equitable, they can reopen a final, final judgment, right?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1076.26,1086.996,"Under those circumstances, it... it would have been within Pacific Mutual's rights... and I'm not saying we would agree to it... for them to have gone the 60(b) route after the statute came in."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1108.68,1111.062,"And... and you know what we would do with it, too."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1120.218,1124.619,"--By the branch of the Government that rendered the judgment, Your Honor, not by another one."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1126.021,1130.113,"But in the case that you were posing, Congress was doing what we were doing under 60(b)."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1130.113,1132.887,"Oh, I don't believe so at all, Your Honor."
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1132.887,1134.538,Then I misunderstood what you were saying.
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1134.538,1135.168,"No, no, no."
1993.93-609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.164,1154.49,"But the same argument could have been made before rule 60(b) was ever enacted, that you will have turmoil if you allow any setting aside of judgments."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1154.49,1159.404,"I... I would suggest to you, Your Honor, both the separation of powers principles and due process."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.98,1185.691,"That's right, but in... excuse me--"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1202.862,1204.202,"--That's my understanding, Your Honor."
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.202,1207.774,"So, it came within the judicial power under traditional understanding?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1207.774,1208.605,Right--

1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1213.438,1218.323,--I really don't know what happens if Congress exercised 60(b); I really hope it never does.
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1218.323,1223.376,"Well, when a court exercises a 60(b) power, it's looking to the individualized facts of the case."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1223.376,1223.877,Correct.
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1223.877,1229.168,"And applying the rule of law, or... or opening a judgment so that a... a rule of law can at least potentially be applied differently."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1229.168,1232.521,"But isn't that something that the courts should do, rather than the Congress?"

1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1233.283,1234.361,Isn't that what separation--
1993.93-609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1234.361,1235.883,"--I quite agree, but that is not what the Congress is doing in this case--"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1235.883,1236.342,--I agree.
1993.93-609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.425,1239.465,--Sioux Nation?
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1239.465,1240.246,--Sioux Nation.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.464,1408.896,"Mr. Benkard, why doesn't the... doesn't the judiciary violate the separation of powers when it denies Congress full control over the timeliness of a statutory claim, claimed as a creation of the legislature, the timeliness of the claim is a legislative judgment?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1439.995,1441.006,--I know this isn't done.
1993.93-609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.006,1441.627,Who is overstepping?
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1441.627,1442.418,May I ask you a question?
1993.93-609,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.634,1452.724,"Well, the grounds would be those set forth in my dissent in Lampf."
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1456.488,1457.169,--Exactly.
1993.93-609,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.169,1463.082,"And it... it occurs to me that you're in precisely the position you would have been had my dissent prevailed in Lampf, aren't you?"
1993.93-609,0,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,1463.082,1466.623,I think that's probably correct.
1993.93-609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1473.838,1474.85,"Very well, Mr. Benkard."
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1477.09,1481.134,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.663,1525.674,"The question is even narrower than that, Mr. Taranto."
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1539.324,1551.453,"That is possible, but I can't, frankly, think of a single case in which this Court has made a decision, in particular, on separation of powers turned on what is, in essence, a non-constitutional formality."
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.411,1570.543,Many things may be done in one way and not done in another.
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1599.631,1601.013,"I think, Justice--"
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.013,1603.414,"There... there's a right way and a wrong way to do things, isn't there?"
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1603.414,1614.023,"--Well, in... in Robertson, the... the legislation was written, it seems to me, in a way that is much more troublesome under separation of powers doctrine than this."
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.57,1710.777,"Can Congress, which is dissatisfied with the... with the outcome of a particular case or a particular class of cases, simply say that those cases shall be retried?"
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1710.777,1715.788,I think that that is... is... it can in certain circumstances.
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1716.75,1718.43,Why in certain circumstances?
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1718.43,1723.722,--Because I think when one follows the Sioux Nation analysis... Sioux Nation necessarily rests on two propositions.
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.166,1774.887,I read Sioux Nation much more narrowly than that.
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1790.258,1791.458,Yes--
1993.93-609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.458,1797.32,"Here... here Congress is legislating not for its... not for the United States, but for private individuals."
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1797.32,1799.633,"--Yes, I... I... that's exactly right."
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.769,1880.535,"That logic may be correct, Mr. Taranto, but... but, insofar as we are bound by stare decisis, all that Sioux Nation holds is that that can happen when the United States is waiving its own... its own right to res judicata."
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1880.535,1881.116,--Yes.
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.993,1908.385,How about Klein?
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1908.385,1931.58,"Well, I... Klein, I think, has quite wisely not been argued in... in this Court precisely because, as this Court made clear in Robertson against Seattle Audubon Society, this is a case in which Congress changed the law applicable to a class of cases and did not simply direct the courts to enter a... a particular decision by making an adjudicatory decision."
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.799,1940.196,"So, if that's the criterion, then I suppose you would say that the only thing they can't do is decide the case in... in your view?"
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1941.217,1941.778,"--No, I don't think so."
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.167,1956.815,--All right.
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1981.432,1986.355,"--I think, as a matter of substantive due process and as a matter of separation of powers, yes, I think Congress--"
1993.93-609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.355,1988.876,"It's very strange that they haven't done that more often, if that's been so available."
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1996.192,1998.053,"--Well, I think--"
1993.93-609,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1998.053,2000.646,"No, please; and when you're done, I have a question."
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2000.646,2024.89,"--I... it seems to me that... that the longstanding presumption against retroactive legislation, including, I think, this kind, reflects deep-seated fairness concerns that is what, over the years, in fact, inhibits Congress or other legislatures from doing this sort of thing on any kind of... in any... in any way that would have generated this precise case in this Court before."
1993.93-609,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2030.664,2034.678,You... you just touched on... on something which... which I was thinking about.
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2100.162,2101.992,"Well, let me... let me see if I can respond this way."
1993.93-609,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2121.274,2122.586,But... but why is that so?
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2123.427,2124.986,"--Well, I--"
1993.93-609,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.986,2128.489,Or why shouldn't it... why shouldn't it be a magic moment?
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2128.489,2136.103,"--Well, I think, in part, because it produces what, to my mind, are arbitrary and indeed upside-down results--"
1993.93-609,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2136.103,2137.175,Arbitrary because?
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2138.236,2157.137,"--Because... because they... the distinction between Congress acting with respect to a pending case and Congress acting with respect to a case that has finally come to an end doesn't, as far as I can tell, either reflect anything in the text... unlike the formal lines relined on in Chada and Bowsher and that line of cases, or the underlying constitutional principle."
1993.93-609,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2176.021,2179.213,"--Well, one of your broadest answers is the line has got to be drawn somewhere."
1993.93-609,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2179.213,2194.313,"I think that the line has to be drawn by looking at whether what Congress has done is to make a adjudicatory decision, whether it acts too narrowly, whether it explicitly changes the law, whether it makes very case specific kind of fact findings."
1993.93-609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.979,2297.56,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2299.371,2305.996,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-609,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2340.217,2350.084,Is there also some principle that the Congress cannot make it extraordinarily difficult for this branch to perform its functions?
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2353.036,2366.655,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, I think there is a principle that... that Congress cannot, by a variety of mechanisms, that... that may not be easy to specify, weaken the judicial branch to the point where it... it cannot perform its function at all."
1993.93-609,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2366.655,2373.95,Could Congress abolish... assuming it could draw a statute that could do it... abolish the doctrine of stare decisis?
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2373.95,2384.536,I would have difficulty understanding a rational basis for Congress to abolish stare decisis entirely.
1993.93-609,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2427.585,2442.245,"But... but I take it one of the principles that you and I were just discussing, with reference to abolition of stare decisis, is that the courts cannot function effectively unless their judgments have a certain degree of (a) finality and (b) respect."
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2442.245,2445.137,"--I agree with both of those propositions, but I think the key is--"
1993.93-609,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2445.137,2446.156,And that's a separation of powers concept.
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2446.156,2448.589,--I think it is at the margins.
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.553,2488.405,"To wit, dissolved existing judgments."
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2513.991,2523.697,"Well, this statute, of course, does not, in terms... to use... to use the formal terms of the statute... it does not dissolve a judgment."
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.026,2628.616,Why not?
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2639.072,2640.505,"--Well, what I--"
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.505,2657.204,"I suppose it follows from what... and this relates to Justice Kennedy's question... I suppose it follows from what you say... that when Congress disagrees with a decision of this Court, it can... you know, that the law is thus and so... it can change the law and require this Court to retry the same case under the new law."
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2657.204,2667.781,"--Well, I think when it changes the law and requires a... a new trial of the case it's not really a new trial."
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.827,2679.0,You... you don't think that that tends to... to demean the judiciary?
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2679.0,2679.859,"No, not at all."
1993.93-609,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.866,2782.207,"Mr. Dreeben, is one reason why this is a novel issue the relative newness of being... I was trying to think whether there was a case involving the stat... change in the Court's interpretation of what the legislature wanted in the way of a statute of limitations, where the Court itself said, applying the first Chevron case... Chevron against Huson... but we are not going to cut short the plaintiff's rights retroactively."
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2799.449,2801.619,"--No, I'm not aware of any, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.594,2829.728,I thought the basis for Beam was that that was the traditional mode of judicial... you're not really saying that prospective decisionmaking has been the tradition?
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2829.728,2830.437,No.
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.307,2847.32,It's pretty novel to... to say we're announcing this only for future cases.
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2850.572,2855.345,--It had... it had been the... the way that the Court had operated for many years.
1993.93-609,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.017,2895.66,"--Mr. Dreeben, I'm wondering to what extent your argument is bottomed entirely in the fact that this is a statute of limitations case?"
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2904.646,2909.46,"Well, I think, Justice Stevens, as to separation of powers, the... the cases are indistinguishable."
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3071.927,3083.044,"Mr. Dreeben, does the Government have any case other than Sioux Nation in... in which Congress has done this... set aside an extant judgment?"
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3083.044,3091.359,"Well, the other cases that... that were the ones that Sioux Nation relied on, which are also cases in which the Government was--"
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.359,3092.19,The Government was a party?
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3092.19,3092.771,--So--
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.771,3098.685,"No case, in... in which a private party was a party to the judgment, has Congress ever tried to set it aside?"
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3098.685,3102.274,--I am not sure that there is no case.
1993.93-609,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.426,3104.317,But you don't know of any?
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3104.317,3104.768,--No.
1993.93-609,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.304,3133.408,"But when it treats it as a disfavored way, as it did in Sioux Nation, there is certainly no problem."
1993.93-609,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3133.408,3145.165,"Well, no problem except to the extent that the principle that is at issue is the independent of the courts to render final judgments on particular claims that shall never, under any circumstances, be relitigated again."
1993.93-609,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.186,3147.428,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."

1993.93-609,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.764,3176.917,"Well, but the statute is not self-executing."

1993.93-609,3,29189,james_w_b_benkard,,3267.756,3268.577,--That's correct.
1993.93-609,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3280.953,3286.877,"So, you're saying that Congress simply cannot prolong a statute of limitations once a judgment has been rendered?"
