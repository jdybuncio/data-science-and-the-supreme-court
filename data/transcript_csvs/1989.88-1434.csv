1989.88-1434,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.789,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1434, Elizabeth Dole v. United Steelworkers of America."
1989.88-1434,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,63.642,66.895,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1434,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.643,298.057,What were the specific items that were disapproved?
1989.88-1434,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,298.057,299.67,There are three disapproved provisions.
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1452.436,1458.42,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.37,1634.495,"Mr. Gold, do you agree that OMB is entitled to a certain amount of deference in its construction of the provisions of the act that are critical here?"
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1634.495,1659.912,"We... we think that they are entitled to a certain amount of deference, but you get into the question which is one which is... we well understand a difficult one, whether OMB is moving into an area that was never intended by Congress to be regulated."
1989.88-1434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.157,1683.028,That is true of all agencies.
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1687.891,1705.642,"--And there are line... there are these line-drawing questions which we think are inherent in the point you've just articulated, and that there is a threshold question every time an agency asks for deference."
1989.88-1434,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.023,1767.074,"Those are old cases, Mr. Gold."
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1779.52,1780.772,--We think they are oldies and goodies.
1989.88-1434,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.772,1788.897,"--Every time, as the Chief Justice suggested, every question that comes up is a question of the agency's authority."
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1803.426,1810.362,"Well, plainly it has no jurisdiction to act unlawfully."
1989.88-1434,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.198,2397.945,"I take it, OMB here on the exemption said they disapprove the exemptions because the exemptions didn't go far enough."
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2397.945,2398.556,Correct.
1989.88-1434,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.556,2404.868,"That you shouldn't have required all these labels in certain areas, even if you thought they should."
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2404.868,2405.68,Correct.
1989.88-1434,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.291,2537.347,"That's not really before us, though, that issue, is it?"
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2545.655,2548.587,It seems to us that it is here.
1989.88-1434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2599.319,2619.032,"Mr. Gold, the government's petition phrases the question, the last four lines, as whether the Paperwork Reduction Act's review process applies to agency regulations developed as a part of the agency's statutory mission that require regulated entities to collect information for disclosure of third parties."
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2619.032,2627.277,"--Well, the only thing I can't figure out of that, Chief Justice, is that on that view, this petition ought to be dismissed and we ought to win."
1989.88-1434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.422,2647.369,"But that, that question suggests that the actual arbitrary and capricious review of particular standards isn't before us now, don't you think?"
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2647.369,2666.874,"--If... I... I don't understand what the government is about in this, and they've saved time for rebuttal, I leave it to them."
1989.88-1434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.147,2752.32,"But supposing we... we were to reject both of what you call its independent grounds, that we would say that the PRA as construed by OMB does cover furnishing of information of third parties, and that it can have something to do with the substantive affairs of the agency."
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2752.32,2752.8,--Right.
1989.88-1434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2752.8,2759.813,"That still would not mean that we were holding OMB's agency, regulations on these particular cases, that we were upholding them, would it?"
1989.88-1434,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2759.813,2784.209,"Well, I presume, to deal with the second of these two questions, you would have to confront our arguments that OMB disregarded the substantive policies and programs of the statute, and therefore acted improperly in this case."
1989.88-1434,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3312.778,3313.639,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1434,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3313.639,3325.299,"Looking at the definitions here, and the one that jumps out at me is the definition of burden."
1989.88-1434,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3337.358,3338.977,"Well, no, Your Honor, I disagree."
1989.88-1434,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.977,3339.558,That's not essential?
1989.88-1434,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3339.558,3340.407,No.
