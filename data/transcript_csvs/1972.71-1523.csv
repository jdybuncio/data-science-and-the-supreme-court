1972.71-1523,0,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,7.18,9.017,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1523,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,9.017,11.735,"Would you just suspend for a moment until we get clear, counsel."
1972.71-1523,0,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,11.735,12.469,"Excuse me, sir."
1972.71-1523,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,12.469,14.067,"That’s fine, alright."
1972.71-1523,0,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,28.135,44.559,This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina which upheld against the challenge under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
1972.71-1523,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,249.569,258.822,Has the State ever defaulted on a revenue bond to the extent that you could call it a default?
1972.71-1523,0,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,258.822,259.653,In this case?
1972.71-1523,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.653,261.021,"No, no."
1972.71-1523,0,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,264.644,266.471,If our State has ever defaulted?
1972.71-1523,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,266.471,267.435,Yes.
1972.71-1523,0,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,267.435,287.217,"On the contrary, our Supreme Court has made a statement in one case that in this enlightened age the State will not allow one of its revenue bond issues to go into default even though it’s not technically liable on them and we’ve never had a default on our revenue bond issue of the electric or the water works or the others."
1972.71-1523,1,27997,huger_sinkler,,1537.37,1538.842,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1523,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.842,1542.673,Mr. Sinkler.
1972.71-1523,1,27997,huger_sinkler,,1542.673,1560.745,I certainly hope that the appellant here is regarded as having standing because this case does have some significance not only in South Carolina but throughout the United States (Inaudible).
1972.71-1523,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.965,1621.784,"What do you mean when you say, you had the question raised?"
1972.71-1523,1,27997,huger_sinkler,,1621.784,1637.018,"Well, because as bond counsel it’s our duty to see that all possible questions involving the constitutionality of the Act could, were properly presented and disposed of before people would be invited to buy bonds based on the statute."
1972.71-1523,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.347,1641.053,But it takes adversary implications (Voice Overlap).
1972.71-1523,1,27997,huger_sinkler,,1641.053,1653.819,"This is adversary litigation of the tested variety which is quite frequent in all courts, state courts to determine question of constitutionality of statutes."
1972.71-1523,2,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,2979.392,3002.362,"If you’ll endorse me for a couple of moments, Your Honor, you -- I did not intend to cut down the attack that was made in the original complaint on this litigation by the position I took here today but the Tilton case was decided since his complaint withdrawn and I’m not sure it would’ve been drawn the same way."
1972.71-1523,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.362,3017.487,"Well, I gather then Mr. Figg, if one would have think that independently of the entanglement features of one thought that the aid out and in of itself was a violation of the Establishment Clause."
1972.71-1523,2,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,3020.064,3025.429,I thought it was until we tried to apply the Tilton case to this case.
1972.71-1523,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.033,3032.64,"Well, you’re not going to give it up based on Tilton, are you?"
1972.71-1523,2,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,3032.64,3034.939,Didn’t intend to give it up but --
1972.71-1523,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.939,3037.565,"So, none of that the issue is here for us to decide?"
1972.71-1523,2,39262,robert_mcc_figg_jr,,3037.565,3037.841,Yes.
