1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.915,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1717, United States v. David Lanier."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,8.066,10.079,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.656,119.176,Why does it have to--
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,136.598,139.03,"Well, yes, we do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.052,150.252,"Well, you may be right."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,150.751,152.493,"But in any event, we do disagree."
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.174,191.251,"Well, if that's true, then why does... there has to be a serious touching, or a serious assault, because that was part of your submission at the outset."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,200.107,203.53,"Well, your... Justice Kennedy, your question raises a lot of issues."
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,267.403,274.077,So in your view the Fourth Amendment is not really the controlling element in this case.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,274.077,290.87,"We think that it's not, although if it were, we would urge the Court to find that in any event there is no prejudice to the defendant because in any event the constitutional right alleged to have been violated would have been the Fourteenth Amendment, since the Fourth Amendment would apply only as incorporated, and the sub--"
1996.95-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,290.87,301.256,"Mr. Waxman, the idea of the Fourth Amendment does go way, way back, even to Boyd v. United States, of any invasion of a person's personal security."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,307.78,311.292,"--No, I... if I did, I certainly meant to say the Fourteenth Amendment."
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,311.292,313.916,"Oh, that was what misled me."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,313.916,314.327,Okay.
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,315.966,316.157,I perhaps misheard you.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,316.157,317.356,I left off a digit.
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.65,334.9,Okay.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,336.673,337.153,--and then the Fourth Amendment test would be unreasonable.
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.153,339.104,--How serious it has to be.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,339.104,348.951,"Well, in Ingraham this Court recognized in the due process context, as this Court recognized in McMillian and the Eighth Amendment context and other courts have recognized, that"
1996.95-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.227,403.03,"Well, maybe... maybe... the instructions here certainly called for more, did they not?"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,403.03,403.688,--They certainly did.
1996.95-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,403.688,420.632,"They called for physical abuse of a serious, substantial nature involving physical force, mental coercion, bodily injury, or emotional damage which is shocking to the conscience, so clearly this instruction envisioned something much more serious than passing some de minimis line."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,420.632,424.783,"That is absolutely correct, and that is why I would submit to the Court that because the--"
1996.95-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,424.783,426.565,"Well, do you think that instruction was wrong?"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,426.565,430.827,"--Well, we thought that the shocks-the-conscience standard was unnecessary."
1996.95-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,440.507,457.686,"I mean, the problem you'd have is that virtually every arrest where handcuffs are put on, or anything of the sort, would result in a Federal case as well as any ordinary excessive force claim."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,457.686,458.057,"--Well, I think--"
1996.95-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,458.057,461.36,"And I think that has to be a concern, of course."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,461.36,461.921,--It very--
1996.95-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,461.921,472.978,"It may not affect this case because of the instruction here, but I think this issue is terribly important, whether it's just some de minimis threshold that's left out, or is it something more."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,472.978,482.335,"--We agree that it is a very important question, and if I could, Justice O'Connor, let me address this case and then get to where... how we think these cases should be decided under other circumstances."
1996.95-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,482.335,487.159,"Well, I prefer that you'd get right down to what the heart of the standard is and then talk about the facts here."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,487.159,487.43,Okay.
1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,516.263,526.07,"Serious and substantial, as you're putting it, is almost inconsistent to me with the concept of a misdemeanor, which is what some of these convictions were."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,526.07,535.056,"--It's true that all but the oral rapes were misdemeanor convictions, but none... it may be, Mr. Chief Justice, that the instructions in this case set the bar too high."
1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.504,563.246,"There's a real element of vagueness in all of this, though."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,563.246,570.822,"Well, there is in this as in, for example, when a jury is asked to decide whether a search and seizure is unreasonable--"
1996.95-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,570.822,571.463,"Mr. Waxman, you just--"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,571.463,571.734,--or whether an obscenity case--
1996.95-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,571.734,581.911,"--Mr. Waxman, you just mentioned 1983 in connection with 242, and it would help me very much if you would clarify two things about the relationship."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,597.281,599.572,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.654,643.544,"I understand the abstract concept, but frankly I don't understand when one intentionally beats another human, to take an example, what is wilful any more than intentional in that context."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,643.544,657.054,"Intentional in conventional common... in conventional criminal law terms, and it's reflected in all of the pattern jury instructions, an intent to do a crime, a specific intent to do a crime means that you intend to do the act which you do."
1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.677,717.778,"Well, Mr. Waxman, that's--"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,734.481,735.222,And laws.
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.222,736.013,Or laws.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,750.184,751.285,That's absolutely right.
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.285,751.576,Now--
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,751.576,752.757,You have to have under color of law.
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.757,755.09,"--Exactly, and... well, more than under color of law."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,840.671,842.033,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.033,850.227,"A policeman, for example, arresting someone is exerting State power over you, and if in the course of that he beats you up, substantive due process has been violated."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,850.227,852.861,"--Justice Scalia, I understand your point about State action."
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.445,873.127,"I wasn't referring to the phrase, under color."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,878.623,890.821,"--Well, the right... this Court has said, Justice Holmes in the Moseley case and this Court many times since has said that this statute and its companion, 241, protect all Federal rights in a bundle."
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.185,898.047,But I think we've treated substantive and procedural due process differently.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,899.797,900.007,I do disagree.
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.007,903.109,--About my example... my example of the motor vehicle employee.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,903.109,903.94,I disagree--
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.94,904.651,He jumps up and beats--
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,904.651,905.603,"--I disagree, and I could cite--"
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.603,913.247,--So any physical tort committed by a State agent in the course of his employment is a constitutional violation.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,913.247,913.598,--No.
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.837,926.745,"You see, I just don't agree."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,936.963,958.318,"--Well, let me give you an example from Polk v. Dodson, a case that this Court decided, in which case this Court held that a State public defender was not acting under color of law when she was engaging in the representation of her clients because, as this Court subsequently explained in West v. Adkins, she was acting as the adversary of the State."
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,978.59,981.092,But that was in relation very specifically to his duties.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,990.731,991.961,Probably not.
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.037,1000.238,"Well, he's on the premises."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1010.023,1012.637,"Well, this... I'm not... I don't know of any--"
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1012.637,1016.667,And incidentally I'm not sure that that isn't true in the case that's before us.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1016.667,1018.78,"--Well, let me talk about the case that's before us."
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.646,1040.887,Haec verba.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1040.887,1048.29,"--in United States v. Classic, and the evidence, I submit, certainly exceeds the minimum that is necessary to find--"
1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.29,1062.259,"Well, so... is it then your position that anything a government, anything a judge does in the course of his office is necessarily under... during working hours is under color of State law?"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1062.259,1087.657,"--No, certainly not, but what you have in this case were, all of these assaults occurred... and I don't intend to get into the details of these assaults, but all of these assaults occurred in his chambers during regular working hours as to women who were either employees hired and supervised by him or people who were there in connection with an official responsibility in which he had asked them to be there, and--"
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1087.657,1091.78,"Well, Mr. Waxman, assuming... taking that as you say, help me on one thing."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1111.993,1114.514,--I believe it was an issue in the trial court.
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1114.514,1116.657,"But was it resolved against the Government, or--"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1116.657,1118.628,It was resolved in favor of the Government.
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1118.628,1119.218,--All right.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1119.218,1123.123,"That is, the... there was a pretrial motion to... well, I will--"
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1123.123,1125.193,"Well, let me change my question."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1137.26,1140.003,"--That is correct, and that was the only basis for the en banc majority."
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1140.003,1146.097,"Can that issue be decided, as I assumed it could be, without getting into the concept of color of law?"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1146.097,1147.75,"Well, we certainly think it can be."
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.905,1158.386,"No, that's not true."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1161.097,1161.467,"Well, the--"
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.467,1164.649,At the first opportunity that this defendant could raise it.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1209.98,1212.6,"--I would make two points, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1243.552,1252.088,"--Mr. Waxman... Mr. Waxman, wasn't she essentially arrested, confined, if we're talking about Vivian Archer?"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1260.504,1264.267,--As to Vivian Archie I think the facts are overwhelming.
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.643,1289.825,"Now, are you saying that this makes the right more specific?"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1289.825,1290.977,I'm not saying--
1996.95-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.977,1301.462,"Because if you are, then I think your answer to Justice Souter might have been that color of law is necessary for us to consider to make the right more specific."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1303.075,1304.186,--That's not my position.
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1330.174,1343.953,"And if you win on that you then go back to the court of appeals for further proceedings on color of law, or the... Justice Scalia's articulation of the concept of right guaranteed?"
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1343.953,1348.087,--I don't think that it's... I suppose maybe I haven't thought of this closely enough.
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.146,1379.353,"I thought it disposed of the case against you and found it unnecessary... having found against you on another ground, found it unnecessary to reach the color of law ground."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1379.353,1379.924,"Well, that--"
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.924,1384.778,"Which seems dirty pool, to never give the defendant a shot at that ground."
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1384.778,1385.087,--I--
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.087,1385.908,The court of appeals never considered it.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1385.908,1387.811,--I would never wilfully play dirty pool.
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.811,1388.221,I'm sure you wouldn't.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1388.502,1391.474,"And in fact if that is the proper construction, it should be set down."
1996.95-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.474,1392.566,It's our rule 3.2.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1394.837,1397.819,"I honor all of your rules, whether they've been made specific or not."
1996.95-1717,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1397.819,1398.68,Mr. Waxman--
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1410.592,1412.493,"Well, I think it does in this respect."
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1434.177,1435.88,Similarly but not identically?
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1437.45,1441.253,Or whether... whether one familiar with the law could have had a legitimate question or better.
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1447.338,1451.441,And don't you think the standard should be the same for... under each standard?
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1451.441,1451.762,I do.
1996.95-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1451.762,1451.952,Yes.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1451.952,1452.102,I do.
1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.555,1455.365,Very well.
1996.95-1717,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1455.365,1455.565,Thank you.
1996.95-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.565,1456.957,"Mr. Knight, we'll hear from you."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1456.957,1464.802,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1497.903,1499.956,"Now, that goes to the color of law issue."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1499.956,1500.875,"Your Honor, I think it--"
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.875,1501.246,Is that before us?
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1501.246,1506.892,"--I believe, Your Honor, it goes in a sense to all three possible issues here."
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1521.803,1562.431,"Oh, I understand your point there, but I think my question is this: if we should determine that the court of appeals was wrong in applying a standard which goes beyond what Mr. Waxman suggested, in other words that goes beyond reasonably definite, and instead require the substantially identical circumstances or facts I think is how the court of appeals articulated it, if we say that was an error, isn't it possible to dispose of that issue without ever determining whether in this particular, or in any of these particular instances the office or the judge in this case was acting under color of law?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1562.431,1597.176,"--I believe you could dispose of that issue, but I believe that in addressing the due process issue there would have to be a finding of State action in connection with this conduct, and State action is in my mind so closely allied with the concept of acting under color of law, I think it would be difficult for this Court to enunciate a due process violation without addressing the question of whether the conduct could be considered State action, which would be very close to determining whether it was action committed under color of State law."
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1597.176,1607.834,"Well, I suppose we would just say we are determining only the question here, how definitely the right must have been articulated prior to the commencement of this prosecution, or prior to the act charged--"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1607.834,1608.983,Yes.
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1608.983,1612.756,--and questions of State action and color of law are simply--
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1612.756,1613.517,Well--
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1613.517,1614.977,--not covered by our opinion.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1614.977,1632.551,"--I would contend, Your Honor, that in determining how specific the due process right must be articulated, or have been previously articulated, the Court would address the question of in what context is the assault conducted?"
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1662.05,1678.823,"I'm inclined to agree with you on the point of breadth that you raise, but I'm not sure that I can agree with you that we could not decide the case on the grounds of what I will call prior definite statement of the right without getting into color--"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1678.823,1692.991,"Well, I do believe, Your Honor, that as an abstract proposition certainly you could decide the due process issue if you felt that the due process issue could be determined without reference to considering the governmental context in which the assault occurred."
1996.95-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1744.265,1744.546,--So--
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1764.141,1765.48,"I cannot, Your Honor."
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.188,1791.867,"Well, what about a policeman trying to keep order at a parade or in a demonstration who just... and has authority to... he doesn't have custody of the onlookers, but he has authority to keep them back from the street, and he wades in with a baton and starts beating them?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1793.279,1802.776,"I suppose, Your Honor, you do get situations where there is not custody in the full sense of an arrest and something happening after the arrest."
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.776,1804.476,I don't think the issue is custody.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1807.688,1811.592,"I would agree with that, Your Honor, that that is the broad issue."
1996.95-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1819.245,1825.74,But you would... would you distinguish the hypothetical Justice Scalia just gave you and the case we have before us?
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1825.74,1842.553,"Yes, Your Honor, I would on the basis that I initially suggested, which is that a judge has no authority conferred by the State to assault or restrain or subdue citizens, and therefore--"
1996.95-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.553,1844.293,May I interrupt you on that question?
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1861.233,1865.787,--He says I would rule against you unless you submit to my advances.
1996.95-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.787,1866.077,Right.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1866.077,1871.881,"Your Honor, that is a use I would think possibly of governmental power."
1996.95-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.423,1894.23,"Well, his... he says, I threaten you with an exercise of my power to rule against you in the case pending before me unless you do what I want you to do."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1894.23,1894.7,Well--
1996.95-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1894.7,1896.353,You'd say that isn't colorable.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1896.353,1914.014,"--I would make the distinction that there's a difference between an extortive use of power, or an extortive use of position where you say, I'm strong enough to force you to do this on the one hand, and saying as a judge I have the authority to sentence you to be assaulted by me."
1996.95-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1914.014,1929.913,"Oh, but I thought you could answer Justice Stevens that that is a more specific right than the right that's involved in this case, i.e., the right to be free from having the judicial officer use the powers and the authority of his office in order to commit a sexual assault."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1929.913,1930.895,"I would agree with that, Your Honor."
1996.95-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.895,1935.909,But that isn't too... Justice Stevens' hypothesis isn't too far from what actually happened here--
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1935.909,1936.087,"Oh, I--"
1996.95-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.087,1938.04,--with the case of the oral rape.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,1938.04,1950.586,"--If Your Honor please, I think there has been some misconception about what happened during those Archie assaults, which are certainly the most serious assaults in the case."
1996.95-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.945,2004.212,"Well, but surely a jury could conclude from that series of events that there was an implied threat to use judicial power if there was no submission."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2004.212,2014.26,"--Well, I would say first of all that that situation is distinguishable from the case raised in that there was no pending case."
1996.95-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2016.02,2019.902,"But he did have the authority to determine custody, didn't he?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2019.902,2026.147,--He would have the... he would be a judge who could have determined custody had the petition been filed.
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2041.187,2056.708,"Well, wouldn't it be sufficient if the jury found that what he said was the equivalent of this: if a custody case, if your custody case comes before me, I can decide it against you unless you do what I want you to do right now?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2062.551,2078.601,I think an explicit threat to use judicial power in a pending case would come within the requirement of an exercise of State power that resulted in the harm.
1996.95-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2079.652,2084.576,"But that has not been the Government's submission here this morning, and it was not the theory on which it tried the case, is it?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2084.576,2087.458,"That is correct, Your Honor, not in the least."
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.279,2102.27,"On color of law, I thought that there was a question of... the definition of Classic, as I understand it, was a misuse of power possessed by virtue of State law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of the law."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2104.98,2108.754,--I think the... they did say that.
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.754,2109.323,Yes.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2109.323,2116.639,"I think what that meant, as I interpret factually what happened in this case, is a little bit deceptive."
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.639,2121.073,"But I mean, my question really is that you accept that as a proper--"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2121.073,2122.133,"They use that terminology, yes."
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.133,2131.59,"--Right, and you accept that as proper, so then the only question would be... if you do accept that as a proper definition, the only question would be whether the facts bring it within that definition, which the jury found they did."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2133.513,2134.535,But I would say that--
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.535,2135.443,Am I right?
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2135.443,2141.257,"--Well, I would say... I'm sorry, Your Honor, but that phrase was used."
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.257,2141.738,Yes.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2141.738,2170.356,"But I would insist that the proper phrase would be misuse of authority, not misuse of power in the sense in which the Government meant it, which was misuse of his status as a judge, which for the most part, to the extent there was any alleged misuse, simply was a subjective feeling on the part of these women that they would not report these assaults because he was a judge."
1996.95-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2175.291,2191.71,"But that... one can distinguish on that basis the misdemeanor types of things from the oral rape, don't you think, that the use of status as a judge is much more apparent in the oral rape case?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2191.71,2198.686,"Well, it is more apparent in that there... it is apparent at all, or that they could be some argument--"
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.686,2199.066,Yes.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2199.066,2200.275,"--made, but I will--"
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.275,2202.827,"And the jury might find it, as you acknowledge."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2202.827,2203.077,--Well--
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.077,2204.97,"I think you acknowledge, although they weren't asked to find it."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2204.97,2207.141,--I didn't mean to acknowledge that the jury could have construed his statement--
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.141,2207.361,Okay.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2207.361,2211.084,"--which is a conversational statement, as a threat."
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.084,2212.203,"But they weren't asked to, anyway."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2212.203,2213.816,They were not asked to anyway.
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2213.816,2223.661,"But on your theory, as I understand it in your response to Justice Breyer and to the Chief Justice, as I understand it you're drawing a distinction something like this."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2250.699,2253.531,"That's the way I draw the line, Your Honor, and I would say--"
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.531,2258.075,"You would say any authority the State gives him, even the authority simply to hire or fire employees?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2258.075,2258.425,--No--
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.425,2259.896,Which is not a distinctively governmental--
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2259.896,2262.317,--In terms of judicial authority--
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.317,2262.647,--Okay.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2262.647,2263.989,--Which I thought--
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.989,2265.699,"I thought the question was broader, and--"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2265.699,2266.289,--No.
1996.95-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2300.504,2302.514,--Let's take color of law out of it.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2324.06,2332.075,"If he has ordered her into his office, let's say, we need to have a pretrial conference in your case, or--"
1996.95-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2332.075,2334.557,"Yes, we have all the color of law that we can hypothesize."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2334.557,2351.359,"--Oh, I concede that if there is an exercise of State-granted power and physical injury ensues, I don't know what the degree of physical injury need be, but I don't deny--"
1996.95-1717,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2351.359,2358.194,Then there is a specific right... there's a specific right of bodily integrity outside the context of people in custody.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2358.194,2361.323,--Theoretically.
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.337,2368.308,"Well, so then you accept the definition of the Solicitor General."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2392.123,2392.965,"You see, Your Honor--"
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.965,2396.727,That's called... what I want to do is give you two or three suggestions and see how you respond.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2396.727,2396.928,--All right.
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2396.928,2406.824,"You'd say, one, this is in the area of substantive due process, i.e., the State cannot remove it from a person irrespective of the procedures."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2406.824,2409.067,If it is genuine State action--
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.067,2409.277,All right.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2449.815,2459.901,"--Particularly the fourth element of that hypothetical, Your Honor, would have to convince me, but I don't know what the Constitution... I don't know what that Constitution--"
1996.95-1717,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.901,2478.634,"If a policeman can't beat up a person, say in the parade, can't hit him over the head, can't put his fist in the person's face at the parade, I suppose it's somewhat similar to have offensive sexual contact with a woman at the least."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2481.395,2513.476,"--I don't think... I think... I think there's... the only difference there would be is that if there is sexual abuse, that would be a sort of a continuum of the exercise of force that began the situation as opposed to a policeman that simply beats up Rodney King and says this whole process was an exercise of legitimate State authority in which I was subduing, trying to arrest him, and trying to defend myself."
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2577.798,2598.722,"Weren't they concerned with the problem of evolution taking place in the course of the prosecution itself, and if that was their concern, then doesn't the Government answer that concern when the Government says, we'll settle for a standard like the Creighton standard on qualified immunity?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2613.741,2622.467,"--Well, it does not underlay those concerns as they were expressed in the Screws opinion."
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2658.662,2689.58,"But that boils down to saying, it seems to me, we don't think the ordinary citizen or, indeed, in this case the ordinary official, should be in the position of having a surprise pulled on him when to that official, even without having done massive research, it would not have seemed reasonably definite in advance that what he was doing was in fact a substantive violation."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2690.941,2697.757,"I think that was part of it, but I also think that there was great concern in that opinion for the ex post factor problems."
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2697.757,2700.029,But isn't that the ex post facto problem?
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2721.683,2730.79,"Well, I think the Court was looking for a kind of definiteness that was quite fact-specific."
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2730.79,2737.165,"Why isn't reasonably definite enough, reasonably definite within the sense that is used in Creighton?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2737.165,2744.619,"Well, reasonably definite implies that there can be conflict among decisions to some degree."
1996.95-1717,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2752.564,2758.579,"Well, isn't it the same kind of inquiry that you conduct under section 1983 for qualified immunity?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2759.52,2762.642,--It is the same inquiry.
1996.95-1717,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2762.642,2764.345,"Well, why shouldn't that be sufficient here?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2764.345,2766.076,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say it's the same inquiry."
1996.95-1717,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2766.076,2767.848,"Well, maybe it is."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2767.848,2769.911,I think it's a stricter inquiry.
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.911,2776.093,Doesn't it depend on what it is that we're inquiring is reasonably definite or not?
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2791.843,2792.114,That--
1996.95-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.114,2810.176,"But if you're going to fold into the inquiry whether it's reasonably definite that a judge who is not immediately in the exercise of his judicial authorities conducts an assault of this sort in his chambers, if that's the question on the other hand, you come up with a different answer, and how do we decide at what level of generality to ask the question?"
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2810.176,2817.493,--I think you ask it if you look at the Screws case at a level that is quite fact-specific.
1996.95-1717,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2818.191,2820.382,"Mr. Knight, let me ask you a fact specific, then."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2839.337,2846.943,"--You know, I will say, Your Honor, in terms of the language of the Screws case itself, it might not."
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2872.151,2885.85,"Well, but maybe the Screws court had nothing more in mind than the possibility of the situation of the prisoner being led down the hallway to trial and a judge in a fit of exasperation coming out of his chambers with a revolver and shooting him."
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2904.654,2904.974,In the course of being transferred--
1996.95-1717,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2904.974,2905.194,--Yes.
1996.95-1717,1,16372,alfred_h_knight,,2905.194,2905.795,--there is then a--
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3170.905,3171.723,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.656,3198.27,"Well, Mr. Waxman, though, you're not... qualified immunity is a civil concept, really."
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3204.125,3214.683,"Well, for sure you would, and the way the standard is made more demanding, Mr. Chief Justice, is by the requirement of a showing that the defendant acted with a bad purpose, with an intent to violate the law."
1996.95-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.683,3218.323,"Yes, but as Justice Kennedy says there's a certain fiction about all of that."
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3218.323,3223.198,"Well, I'm not sure that I really understand what the fiction is."
1996.95-1717,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3252.012,3261.727,"Well, the fiction is is that they probably weren't thinking in constitutional terms, and if you use the term wilfully, then you say well, you intend the consequences of your act, but then you're right back where you started from."
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3261.727,3273.894,"That is exactly right, and what this Court said in Screws, and I quote, it is not necessary that you... to show or prove that the defendant was thinking in constitutional terms at the time of the incident."
1996.95-1717,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3282.089,3286.524,But that seems to take out the one specific element that you put in at the beginning of the premise.
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3286.524,3286.724,--No.
1996.95-1717,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3307.538,3313.923,"So the right, you could... I could know it was a right, because I know that the criminal law makes criminal that which I am doing, thereby giving a right to the victim."
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3313.923,3318.524,"That is absolutely right, and that is the way this Court has construed that language."
1996.95-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3318.524,3327.229,"I took that to mean that they had to intend to make sure this guy never got to trial, whether or not they knew there was a constitutional right for him to get to trial."
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3327.229,3328.421,That was in the--
1996.95-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3328.421,3331.673,But they had to intend to prevent him from getting to trial.
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3331.673,3331.904,--No--
1996.95-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.904,3333.143,That's not how it reads?
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3333.143,3358.521,"--What it reads is, for example, if you just take the way... just look at the way in which Screws was presaged in Classic and applied in Guest, which was decided afterwards, in both of those cases the constitutional right involved... in Classic it was the right that the Federal Constitution protected voting in a primary election, and in Guest it was the right to travel."
1996.95-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3378.437,3383.292,"Of the right to travel, or of the right to be tried, but certainly not just to beat up the citizen."
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3383.292,3385.683,"Well, it would have to be more than beat up the citizen."
1996.95-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3399.614,3401.084,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
1996.95-1717,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3402.6,3403.684,Thank you.
