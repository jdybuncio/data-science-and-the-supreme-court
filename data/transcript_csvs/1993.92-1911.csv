1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.362,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-1911, Public Utility District... the spectators are admonished to remain silent until you get out of the Court."
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,57.729,61.032,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.304,198.512,"Mr. Shapiro, wouldn't a decision as to preemption be premature here, since the Commission hasn't yet acted on the application for a license?"
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,198.512,200.272,"No, Your Honor, it would not."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.85,236.627,"The Commission is not capable, then, of saying that the amount of water set aside in the certificate is not consistent with the project we have in mind and therefore we're going to change it?"
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,236.627,260.072,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and this point was quite correctly recognized by the supreme court of Washington at petitioner's appendix page 16a, where it pointed out the very thing I have said, that FERC has to comply with the certification condition regardless of its legality."
1993.92-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.252,359.851,"And certainly the consultation process that the Federal Power Commission, now FERC, is supposed to engage in with the State authorities before determining... before issuing the license and before determining what the proper flow is in order to preserve fish habitat and so forth, that consultation process becomes rather superfluous if the State has a trump card."
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,359.851,366.963,"That is exactly right, and that is really the essence of our argument that in effect we have a kind of a reversal of the preemption process."
1993.92-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.314,560.276,What's the code number?
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,560.276,567.859,"I believe it is 1313, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.822,579.987,"You experts in the area always use the statute number, which makes those of us who only occasionally visit the field confused."
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,579.987,590.295,"Yes, Your Honor, and it is 1313 of 33 U.S. Code, and you will find the beginning at page 114a."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.263,633.404,"Where are you reading from, Mr. Shapiro?"
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,633.404,637.028,Page 117a of the petitioner's appendix.
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.028,638.448,Where--
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,638.448,639.98,It's at paragraph 2a.
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.98,641.489,"--Oh, thank you."
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,641.489,650.856,"""When a State revises or adopts a new standard, the revised new standard must be submitted to the EPA for approval. """
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,696.487,701.121,May I ask you a question that gets specific to the problem that I have with your argument there?
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,796.706,799.717,"Yes, Your Honor, for this reason."
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,819.351,819.901,Yes.
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,819.901,827.035,And it must also violate the criteria to protect that use.
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,830.258,834.962,"If we disagree with you on that, do you lose this argument?"
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,834.962,837.864,I certainly lose this aspect of the argument--
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,837.864,838.132,Yes.
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,838.132,846.94,--because then the case becomes one in which all that's necessary to make a water quality standard is a designated use.
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,919.017,929.022,Unless we accept use as being a standard applicable under subsection (C) and hence ultimately through 401(a)... 401(a) or 401(d).
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,929.022,930.923,Either that--
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,930.923,943.872,"If we accept a use designation, or I suppose if we accept a nondegradation requirement as being a water quality standard sufficient to justify a certification limitation, then that's the end of that argument, is that correct?"
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,943.872,945.802,"--Not as we read the statute, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,961.704,963.604,Could you give me the code number?
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,965.207,966.907,"I believe it is 1370, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1078.125,1080.415,"Mr.... go on, I'm sorry."
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1094.264,1096.037,"That is correct, your Honor."
1993.92-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.855,1097.256,So your--
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1097.256,1116.39,"--degradation policy is a part of water quality standards under EPA regulations, and there is a... there... after many years, Congress in 1987 added an express reference to the antidegradation policy established under this section."
1993.92-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.384,1184.445,--So a reduction in stream quantity would not constitute degradation unless by reason of the reduction in water quantity the percentage of pollutants would go up downstream.
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1184.445,1185.334,Yes.
1993.92-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.155,1189.707,--the quality of--
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1189.707,1197.552,--the receding waters by either adding a pollutant or adding water that was inconsistent with water quality criteria.
1993.92-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1197.552,1210.901,"--If use designation may be considered, if it reduces the flow so as to preclude a designated use, and I realize you don't concede that use designation may be considered, but that would be the consequence if we did consider it for this purpose."
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1210.901,1211.901,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1218.837,1223.05,Is a change in temperature a degradation of the water?
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1223.05,1223.611,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.316,1249.998,"What was the page reference again, please?"
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1249.998,1270.001,"--It is page 10a and 11a, Your Honor, where the criteria are, but I think we probably should begin just for convenience at page 8a, which is where the water quality standards for the Dosewallips River are defined."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1275.527,1277.948,This is a regulation?
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1277.948,1279.759,This is a regulation--
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1279.759,1280.62,A State regulation--
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1280.62,1283.891,--This is the water quality standard approved by EPA applied in this case.
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1283.891,1286.863,"--It's not a statute, it's a regulation."
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1286.863,1287.732,It is a regulation.
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.825,1323.486,Where is... where is paragraph (c)?
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1323.486,1328.571,"--Paragraph (c) is near the bottom, Your Honor, about five lines up."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.571,1330.331,"Where it says, ""Water quality criteria""?"
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1330.331,1331.062,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.062,1332.682,Okay.
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1332.682,1339.567,"Now, the first few of those criteria are really numeric physical measures."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.917,1369.489,Where are we on the page?
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1369.489,1377.694,"On the page we are now on 9a, and we're down near the bottom at (vii)."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1377.694,1384.988,"Now, (vii) is a subsidiary part of (c)?"
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1384.988,1385.789,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.83,1389.463,Okay.
1993.92-1911,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1389.463,1396.987,"And we have a general narrative requirement for toxic, radioactive, or deleterious material concentrations."
1993.92-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.963,1438.854,"Very well, Mr. Shapiro."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1440.567,1445.219,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1519.107,1531.775,"Now, General Gregoire, you say... where is the antidegradation policy, as opposed to the general water and use criteria classes, found."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1531.775,1539.129,The antidegradation policy of the State of Washington is found in respondent's brief at 5a.
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.129,1541.172,"Is it a statute, or--"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1541.172,1552.129,"It is a Washington Administrative Code provision, 173-201-035, adopted by the State as a result of the mandate of EPA."
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.405,1605.755,"--Well, it certainly means antidegradation insofar as the quality of the water may cause a degradation of the use, but does it include degradation where the quality of the water is constant, or even higher?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1610.215,1619.231,"Your Honor, very clearly EPA has said that antidegradation policy is intended to protect the existing use... here, salmon and steelhead."
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.231,1623.125,"Well, of course it is, but does it do so only by regulating quality?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1630.32,1634.475,The two are inextricably linked in this case.
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.876,1665.594,"Well, it may be different in that only that violates... only by reducing the quality of the water do you violate the Clean Water Act, which is, after all, called the Clean Water Act not the Voluminous Water Act."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1666.735,1670.419,"No question, Your Honor, but the two are inextricably linked here."
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.207,1674.349,What's the textual basis for the inextricable link?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1674.349,1695.393,"--Well, again, if you look at 1987 amendments by Congress, what they said very clearly there in amending section 303 of the Clean Water Act is that they had long meant ""maintain"" to mean the antidegradation policy, and that any standards and permitting standards were subject to and had to be consistent with the antidegradation policy."
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1695.393,1695.953,"Well, what if--"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1702.158,1704.439,"With regard to section 303, Your Honor?"
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.439,1708.503,"Whatever it was that you just referred to, the 1987--"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1708.503,1716.308,"That is found at petitioner's appendix 121a, wherein it states,"
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.371,1723.802,--Where on the page are you reading from?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1723.802,1725.004,"Let me grab it here, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.004,1732.997,Is it capital B?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1732.997,1739.322,"Down at the bottom of the page, Your Honor, (4)(B), ""Standard attained""."
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.322,1740.013,Okay.
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1740.603,1753.201,"And where it says that, ""To protect the designated use"" and then it goes on to talk about effluent limitation, it goes on to talk about water quality standards, it goes on to talk about permitting standards, and says,"
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.526,1766.1,And this is now saying to the States that these standards can't be revised?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1766.1,1767.442,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1767.442,1768.29,But how--
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1768.29,1769.482,EPA... I'm sorry.
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1769.482,1773.964,"--But how do we know that ""standard"" means the use designation as distinct from the criteria?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1773.964,1775.596,"Well, if you--"
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1775.596,1783.28,"Where's the definition in any of this of ""standard"" to make it clear textually that ""standard"" has the breadth of meaning that you are assuming?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1783.28,1789.975,"--Again, if I can talk about the process here, Congress mandated the partnership between the State and EPA."
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1797.051,1804.345,"All right, and where does Congress use the term just as you have used it, as part of your water quality standard,"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1811.501,1819.695,"What Congress has said is you have to list... as petitioner has indicated, Mr. Shapiro, you have to indicate the designated uses and the criteria to protect that."
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1819.695,1821.665,"No, but you're telling me what they have done."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1824.416,1825.728,I'm sorry.
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1833.203,1843.741,"But does section 303 do so in a way that makes it plain, in your view, that water quality standard includes use designation and antidegradation policy?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1843.741,1847.154,"Well, the clear legislative history of that amendment--"
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1847.154,1850.036,"I guess the answer is no, it doesn't clearly make--"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1850.036,1851.475,--It doesn't articulate it in the way--
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1851.475,1851.796,--Yes.
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1851.796,1862.213,"--in which you just said, Your Honor, but if one looks at that legislative history, it calls that antidegradation policy literally the cornerstone of the Clean Water Act."
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.708,1905.16,"Undoubtedly they do, but the question is whether antidegradation means that the quality of the water shall not go below the level necessary for extant uses, and let's look again at page 121a of the section that you were quoting from, (4)(B), standard attained."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1945.005,1953.771,"But Your Honor, what we have here is a water quality issue putting at risk the uses, the existing uses in this stream."
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.116,1975.416,"I understand that's very bad, perhaps, but the point is that the Clean Water Act doesn't seek to prevent degradation from all sources, it seeks to prevent degradation of quality."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,1985.082,1996.31,"Your Honor, if I could refer you to 33 U.S.C. section 304, it's found at the State's brief, 32 to 33, note 38."
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.716,2007.577,"Now, this is page 32 and 33 of the red brief?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2007.577,2008.098,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.098,2008.959,Note 38.
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2011.46,2012.051,Yes.
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.225,2035.048,Is this part of the Clean Water Act?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2035.048,2035.686,"It is, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.686,2042.041,Is the full text of this... at least the sentences set forth somewhere else?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2048.364,2050.408,"I apologize, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.864,2068.438,"No, but change of flow or circulation may also affect quality of the water."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2089.322,2101.349,"--The Clean Water Act deals with Congress' articulation of maintenance and restoration of the chemical, physical, biological integrity of the Nation's waters."
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.702,2155.446,You say that the State of Washington had no choice in this case but to do what it did.
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2155.446,2156.678,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.678,2163.49,"It wasn't something it just opted to do as within its latitude under the Federal scheme, it had to do this."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2163.49,2171.605,We see no option for the State to carry out its water quality standards mandated and approved by EPA to do anything other than what it did in this case.
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.605,2198.403,"But as I understand it, your answer to the broad argument that this act is concerned with quality, not quantity, is the answer that you gave to me, and that is that the act in effect requires the State and in any event requires licensees to respect the State's certification subject to limits for the purpose of preserving... of imposing State standards."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2231.614,2232.105,Yes.
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2232.886,2243.773,"And the way to make sure you're right, you tell me, is to look at 303 and its legislative history, because that will make it clear, you tell me, that standards do include the three elements and not merely the element of criteria?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2243.773,2244.704,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2244.704,2245.215,Okay.
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2245.215,2246.365,And the implementing--
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.365,2247.116,"Well, that doesn't prove it."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2295.919,2297.42,"--Maybe I can help in this way, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2353.407,2361.162,"Well, General Gregoire, is there any reason to think that FERC wouldn't protect streamflow in its license review?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2377.552,2385.729,"Your Honor, what the State did here was its very limited authority of water quality and ensuring water quality."
1993.92-1911,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2396.555,2398.685,"Well, could you answer my question?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2398.685,2399.116,I'm sorry.
1993.92-1911,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2399.116,2404.99,Is there any reason to think that FERC won't impose streamflow limitations to protect the fish?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2404.99,2409.204,I can't answer your question because they have not yet done anything in this case--
1993.92-1911,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2409.204,2414.938,"Well, they haven't done it because they have to get the conditions under the Clean Water Act first, don't they?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2414.938,2415.977,"--They do, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2415.977,2418.398,"Yes, so of course they haven't acted yet."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2418.398,2419.24,Right.
1993.92-1911,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2419.24,2419.77,Yes.
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2419.77,2427.694,So I don't know that they would set an instream flow to protect the water quality of the State of Washington consistent with the 401 certification.
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2435.11,2438.703,"Well, they would have to set the flow requirement and consult with the State, would they not?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2438.703,2447.569,But they are not required... they are not required as a result of that 10(j) process to set that minimum flow solely to protect water quality standards.
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.245,2492.476,Doesn't 10(j) require... require them to protect the fish?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2497.521,2497.932,Yes.
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.932,2499.963,--about what it takes to protect the fish.
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2499.963,2500.694,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.694,2504.826,"But they must protect the fish, in their own judgment at least, right?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2504.826,2506.528,"Well, not necessarily."
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.528,2506.879,No?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2506.879,2509.83,"They do a balancing there, and they... it is required under 10(j)--"
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.83,2510.328,"Oh, really?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2510.328,2515.931,"--that if they disagree with whatever the Federal and State Fisheries & Wildlife Departments may recommend, they have to state why."
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.931,2520.005,If they disagree with it in the sense of saying we don't want these fish?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2520.005,2520.826,No.
1993.92-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.826,2521.477,"They can't do that, can they?"
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2521.477,2542.261,"If they disagree in that they have balanced the need of consumer electrical power, et cetera, against the need for the protection of the fish, but that... that balancing act... that balancing act comes after the system that Congress has put in place in the Clean Water Act which says, under no circumstances will we allow the degradation of the water quality."
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2548.734,2551.066,"Miss Gregoire, I have one collateral question."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2551.066,2551.655,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.655,2560.1,Could the State of Washington under your State constitution simply pass a law telling the city to comply with the State standard as a matter of State law?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2560.1,2563.864,Our position would be no.
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2567.437,2575.164,"No... no, my question, you just have a State law, and the State law says the city must follow whatever standard we set as a matter of State law."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2575.164,2576.944,"--No, not as a matter of State law, Your Honor--"
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2576.944,2578.125,"No, this is my hypothetical."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2578.125,2578.566,--I'm sorry.
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2578.566,2580.066,I'm having a hypothetical statute--
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2580.066,2580.617,All right.
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.617,2590.304,"--that the State of Washington passes, and it says to all of its agents, its cities, you must comply with the water standards we set as a matter of State law."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2590.304,2593.693,"They can... yes, they can do that."
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2594.595,2596.626,The State of Washington could do that under its State constitution?
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2596.626,2602.9,"--It could do that, but that would not necessarily answer the question here as to whether it's a water quality decision under 401."
1993.92-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.9,2604.262,"Well, it would certainly prevent the city from litigating."
1993.92-1911,1,18978,christine_o_gregoire,,2604.262,2608.294,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.294,2609.155,"Thank you, General Gregoire."
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2611.505,2616.761,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1993.92-1911,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.761,2634.301,"Mr. Wallace, Mr. Shapiro told us in his part of the argument that the FERC is bound as to the conditions that we're talking about now, and it could not change those, and he referred to a case from the D.C. Circuit."
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2636.944,2649.76,"--Well, we... in a sense, yes, that the statute says that any condition imposed in the section 401--"
1993.92-1911,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.76,2651.162,"Well, what do you mean when you say, in a sense you agree?"
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2651.162,2689.197,"--Well, because this Court's decision in Escondido points out that whilst FERC must recite such a condition in the license that it issues, it can also explain any basis it has for disagreeing with that condition, and in a lengthy footnote explain that FERC could then take the position in court that that condition is not a proper one in light of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Power Act, and I'm referring to footnote 20 on page... at 466 U.S., page 778."
1993.92-1911,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.885,2722.409,"It would have to go to court and say, we don't want this condition in the license we're about to issue?"
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2722.409,2733.185,"It would make findings as well with respect to it, and probably the applicant would go to court and FERC could support the applicant in that respect."
1993.92-1911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2736.057,2741.05,"But Mr. Wallace, isn't it true that petitioners at least would be disabled."
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2754.249,2786.861,"--They are free to argue what the Federal Power Act, with our criteria applicable thereto, would lead to as a conclusion, and if they persuade FERC that its responsibilities under the Federal Power Act are inconsistent with this condition, then a question would be presented about how to reconcile the two statutes, so that it's possible that they could get a judgment that ultimately would supersede this condition, and it's possible that it would not ultimately--"
1993.92-1911,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2786.861,2797.176,"They would be precluded with respect to what the Clean Water Act means, but they would be free to argue that there's another Federal... piece of Federal legislation, that the two Federal acts are at war with each other?"
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2797.176,2797.797,--Exactly.
1993.92-1911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2805.905,2811.317,"Excuse me, Escondido was referring to different conditions."
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2811.317,2813.809,"--Yes, but it said how--"
1993.92-1911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.809,2814.62,"Well, that makes a big difference, doesn't it?"
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2822.875,2827.026,--By the Secretary of the Interior under other statutory authority.
1993.92-1911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.026,2829.678,"Well, that doesn't say at all that the same scheme applies under the Clean Water Act."
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2829.678,2842.036,"It doesn't say that it does, but it's a strong suggestion by analogy, because these are comparably conditions required to be recited in the license."
1993.92-1911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.321,2987.255,"And you think that the way the Federal Government decided uniformly for all these old statutes the whole hob... you know, bundle of them, to require all Federal agencies to abide by State streamflow requirements was the Clean Water Act."
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2992.169,2997.772,--There's no doubt that they have to comply... they have to get 401 certificates.
1993.92-1911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.566,3009.27,It's an indirect way to have such a significant effect upon Federal action.
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3009.27,3018.546,"Well, the effect will be there because petitioner admits that the criteria have to be satisfied."
1993.92-1911,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3079.936,3081.726,"Well, are you here telling us, Mr. Wallace--"
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3081.726,3082.286,--need water to survive.
1993.92-1911,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3082.286,3093.243,"--Are you here telling us that the Federal Government can't protect these habitats under any and all licensing schemes that it has, that it can't and it won't?"
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3097.427,3099.076,This is a Federal--
1993.92-1911,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3099.076,3099.517,Is that it?
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3099.517,3105.902,"--statutory program, the Clean Water Act, and these standards have been approved by EPA."
1993.92-1911,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.388,3135.451,"I assume you're speaking for FERC as well as for the rest of the Federal Government, is that right?"
1993.92-1911,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3137.502,3141.906,--We do represent all of these interests in the Court.
1993.92-1911,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3150.021,3151.791,"--Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1993.92-1911,3,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,3168.243,3171.635,"Yes, Your Honor."
