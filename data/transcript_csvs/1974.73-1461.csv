1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.258,"We'll hear arguments next in 1461, Stanton against Stanton.o"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,38.533,39.368,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,122.467,136.196,Is it common in Utah to have a support provision and a decree if able to identify the precise age to which the support money is to be paid?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,136.196,139.944,"Its not uncommon, Your Honor."
1974.73-1461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.172,161.514,"The parties here couldve provided for termination at any age, I take it, by agreement?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,161.514,166.156,"By stipulation, I would see no reason why they could not have done that."
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,166.156,172.604,What was -- this decree was that something that was negotiated and agreed upon between the parties?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,172.604,182.61,There was a stipulation for the decree and for the awarding of the divorce to the wife and for the granting of custody to her and to the payment of support for the children.
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.148,195.243,"If that was negotiated against the background of this statute as far as standing statute of Utah, wasnt it?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,195.243,198.699,"Yes sir, there were two statutes in effect at that time."
1974.73-1461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,227.343,228.984,"Now, let me ask you about that statute?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,233.557,235.501,The application of the support statute?
1974.73-1461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,235.501,236.088,Yes.
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,236.088,239.552,Yes Your Honor it was.
1974.73-1461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,239.552,244.352,Would that statute win your case for you?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,244.352,257.939,"It would have won the case for us, if the Supreme Court had seemed fit to interpret it as establishing the age to which support would continue in a divorce proceeding."
1974.73-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.483,311.717,"In fact, it means that in this case under the state decision support for the daughter stopped?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,311.717,312.04,That is correct.
1974.73-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.04,315.422,And it would not have and would not stop for a son?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,315.422,318.528,"Well, it stops in a divorce proceeding."
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,318.528,329.461,"Yes but it stops, does it not because in effect this statute 1521, your Supreme Court has read into the divorce decree, hasnt it?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,329.461,330.307,Thats correct.
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,330.307,342.681,"Well, now if thats so what we in fact have is an ordinary support decree as if it had been negotiated between the parties as the Court has construed it, isnt not?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,342.681,346.199,"Well, but this construction didnt occur until sometime after the Court --"
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,346.199,350.019,"What it did or didn't, whatever it may have been, isnt that the fact?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,350.019,357.655,"No, I dont think the Court based this on any concept that the parties had stipulated with respect to the ages at which --"
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.655,366.471,"I didnt suggest that but as if they had stipulated, how otherwise that this Court read this statute into the divorce decree?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,366.471,380.378,"Well, it said that support money ends at the age of majority, daughters attain their majority when they're 18, so, the support money ends."
1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,384.163,387.649,Precise language of the stipulation and the decree.
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.782,396.539,"Of the appellants brief, defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff, is that it?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,396.539,405.361,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.361,418.502,"Yet it did leave open, I take it, the Supreme Court of Utah, the possibility that if the decree had provided otherwise that the statute would have played no harm?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,418.502,419.943,I suppose it was left open.
1974.73-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.562,438.247,If the Court construed that the decree as meaning support until they reached the majority and then as a matter of law under the statute that when 18 for the girl?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,438.247,439.67,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,445.512,458.787,"Mr. Roe, if you prevail here, do you still win or lose than what is the date when under this statute support ceases?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,462.615,464.627,"Well, I would think that looking -- Oh!"
1974.73-1461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,465.314,467.432,Or is it 21 for both sons and daughters?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,467.432,472.287,"Yes, I would think looking at the general legislative policy it would have to be 21 for both."
1974.73-1461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,472.287,476.713,"Well, is it something that we can determine here?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,485.165,485.947,"Well, there is."
1974.73-1461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.635,533.733,"Well, but if the Supreme Court of Utah were to come out to say if this Court were to invalidate the distinction, the Supreme Court of Utah would say, “Alright, from now on its 18 for everybody.”"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,539.375,550.317,"Thats -- if the Supreme Court of Utah felt it could do that, thats correct."
1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,552.448,564.79,Do you suggest thats a remote prospect in view of the fact that this Court has said that 18 is the voting age which of course doesnt directly bear on this?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,564.79,569.908,"Well, yes I think."
1974.73-1461,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,666.49,679.874,"Mr. Roe, in this case, could the daughter have brought suit under Utah law to enforce this marital settlement agreement?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,679.874,685.407,She -- I have never found a case in which that has been done.
1974.73-1461,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,723.126,727.108,"In this case, the support might have been provided by the parent?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,727.108,729.062,"Yes, there's been no issue about that."
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,736.016,753.504,"Mr. Roe, I confess this opinion of your Supreme Court is not a model of clarity, but my questions earlier are prompted by what appears at 10 (a) and 11 (a) of the opinion."
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,783.258,785.682,"Well, it certainly did do that."
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,804.974,809.454,"Well, but the difficulty – isnt there a difficulty with that that the parties did agree to that."
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,818.679,834.357,"Well, it was a simple stipulation before decree and I think and its fairly customarily they say, “We stipulate that the divorce may be entered if the mother proves grounds and that she may have custody and will pay so much support money."
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,834.87,840.599,"But the problem here is not whether the money shall be paid to the daughter, rather it is whether the money shall be paid to the mother?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,840.599,841.263,And that is correct.
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,841.263,851.352,"Because she is the one that was -- is the one who wanted the decree according to the terms of the decree, is to the one to whom the husband pays the money?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,851.352,852.244,"Yes, there --"
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,852.244,872.326,And now I'm only suggesting that it seems to me that your Supreme Court is in effect reading the decree as limiting the husbands obligation for support for the payments to the mother on behalf of the daughter to the years before shes 18 and for the son until hes 21?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,872.326,873.669,"Well, thats what the Court is doing."
1974.73-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.76,897.785,"But what if the agreement -- what if the stipulation had said, “Support until their majority?”"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,897.785,900.268,I think we would still have the same question.
1974.73-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.268,908.432,"Well, I know but then they wouldnt if they have said, “If thats the daughters name they would have said 18 in parenthesis and --"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,908.432,908.69,"No, I think --"
1974.73-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.69,910.913,-- thats the one they would have agreed to it?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,910.913,917.172,If the parties agreed to pay support to one of them until that she was 18 and the other until 21 and the court approved it.
1974.73-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.172,922.224,If they said the majority in the state statute specified what the majority was?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,922.224,922.666,"Well, I agree."
1974.73-1461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,926.343,949.604,"Well now, its arguable thats -- it is arguable that the Supreme Court of Utah has equated your situation with my supposition in that when you agreed just to provide support that meant under state law until their majority which in turn meant until 18 and 21?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,949.604,965.723,"Yes, but this decision was based upon an interpretation of the state law and its application and not upon the use of the state law to try and interpret what the parties were stipulating to."
1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,965.723,979.403,"How does that square with the proposition that I understood you accepted that the -- Mr. and Mrs. Stanton couldve agree in that stipulation and decree on age 18 for both, 20 for both, 21 for both, or 25 for both?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,979.403,980.213,Yes.
1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,980.213,983.59,And they merely incorporated something by reference here.
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,988.389,996.724,"But the stipulation did not purport to incorporate anything, did not in fact refer to age of majority, referred only to children."
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.163,1040.43,"Certainly, as one reads the opinion of the Supreme Court of the State of Utah, its rational doesnt seem to be at all as indicated in questions from the bench."
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1050.249,1050.449,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.449,1054.055,-- it goes on to consider the constitutionality of that statute.
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1054.055,1054.376,"Yes, and then --"
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1054.376,1072.48,It doesn't suggest it all that the parties -- that its construing the decree as such and that since it was negotiated decree its equivalent to having explicitly said support the son until hes 21 and the daughter until shes 18.
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1074.039,1078.007,"No, I could not read that case that way Your Honor."
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.007,1079.202,"This case, the opinion in this case?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1079.202,1088.579,"Yes, I mean the Supreme Courts opinion."
1974.73-1461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1248.712,1251.658,"Of course the statute wipes that out anyway, doesnt it?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1259.52,1260.908,"Yes, thats right."
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1266.415,1268.069,Of either sex?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1268.069,1268.14,Yes.
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1268.14,1268.695,Of either sex?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1268.695,1269.447,Of either sex.
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1367.081,1369.399,"How old is this statute, Mr. Roe?"
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1369.399,1371.122,The original statute?
1974.73-1461,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1371.122,1372.354,This 15 --
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1372.354,1373.13,1852.
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1373.13,1374.507,1852.
1974.73-1461,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1374.507,1376.104,Way back to territorial days?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1376.104,1378.093,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.043,1395.275,I noticed that you cite Frontiero and Reed against Reed but you dont mentioned Shevin and Kahn.
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1395.275,1395.734,"Yes, I've --"
1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1395.734,1397.805,Is there anything to do with it?
1974.73-1461,0,17996,bryce_e_roe,,1397.805,1405.542,I did mention Shevin -- Kahn versus Shevin but only briefly.
1974.73-1461,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1615.171,1616.511,Mr. Frederick.
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1616.511,1620.542,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1461,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1692.913,1695.809,"But she is asking for monetary relief, is she not?"
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1695.809,1697.074,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.73-1461,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1707.471,1709.482,"Well, isnt that how this whole lawsuit arose?"
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1709.482,1710.64,That is correct.
1974.73-1461,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1710.64,1715.818,And it does involve three years worth of support payments?
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1715.818,1716.649,It does Your Honor.
1974.73-1461,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1794.782,1799.623,"What's involved here in dollars and cents is three years, is it?"
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1799.623,1800.557,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1461,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1800.557,1804.959,"This young lady became 21 on February 12, 1974?"
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1804.959,1807.198,"1974, yes sir."
1974.73-1461,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1807.198,1809.749,"So, actually that's $3,600.00, is that what?"
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1809.749,1811.601,"$2,700.00 I believe is the figure."
1974.73-1461,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1811.601,1812.476,"Oh, is that it?"
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1812.476,1815.133,Yes sir.
1974.73-1461,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1818.815,1832.922,"I take it even if there were reversal there, it may not -- then it have to go back to the Supreme Court of Utah which and as been suggested it might say no both cuts off at 18?"
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1832.922,1834.373,"Yes Your Honor, in fact that --"
1974.73-1461,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1834.373,1835.403,You might still win?
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1835.403,1840.338,"-- the point that I am here going to raise next, I think there's no substantial federal question here."
1974.73-1461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.151,1869.424,So this would be quite independent of a divorced decree or any divorce proceeding?
1974.73-1461,1,30251,j_dennis_frederick,,1869.424,1871.878,"It is, yes sir it is."
