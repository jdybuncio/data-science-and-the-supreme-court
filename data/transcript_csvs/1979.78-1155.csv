1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.071,We will hear arguments first this morning in Vitek against Jones.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,8.293,11.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,53.732,61.83,"Then it's clear that at the time the three-judge court acted, he was still in the VA hospital in Illinois?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,61.83,63.329,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,63.329,63.968,How soon after--
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,63.968,73.195,"Shortly after that, about three months, I believe, he was found to have left--he violated it some way."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,110.077,114.622,Why is there a case in controversy about that at this point?
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,114.622,120.498,"Well, because the three-judge court, Your Honor, enjoined the State of Nebraska."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,120.498,122.481,"Oh, I understand that."
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,148.712,152.371,"No, because the state has been enjoined from transferring him to--"
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.371,164.239,"Well, I know, but if there's no case or controversy left, if the case is mooted, what you would do is, you would vacate the district court's judgment, and dismiss it, dismiss the case."
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,169.957,172.339,"You wouldn't object to that, would you?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,172.339,174.147,"No, I wouldn't object to that, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,176.57,180.075,Why is it a live case at this point?
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,183.348,185.743,"I can't say that, Your Honor, one way or another."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,197.042,198.305,But you say you can't say --
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,198.305,200.495,But we don't know from one day to the next.
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.495,209.478,"When you say you can't say, you don't mean it's a state secret that you can't reveal, but just that you simply never know --"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,209.478,209.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.819,211.755,-- until something happens whether it'll be done or not.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,211.755,222.935,"Never know, and I am sure that they are ready to transfer him, according to the statute, is what they would like to do, at any time if he should suddenly become violent."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.935,224.225,Just like any other inmate.
1979.78-1155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,224.225,225.101,"Well, that's true of any prisoner."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.101,226.713,Just like any other inmate.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,226.713,230.612,Except that we aren't subject to an injunction on any other prisoner except--
1979.78-1155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.612,235.798,I understand that; forget the injunction for a moment.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,244.7,245.481,It might.
1979.78-1155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,245.481,248.177,"Well, how do you know?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,248.177,251.593,"Well, it would depend on, I support on his conduct."
1979.78-1155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,251.593,252.52,On his conduct.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,252.52,253.137,On his conduct.
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,253.137,259.483,"Well, I suppose if he developed tuberculosis, they might transfer him to an institution where they could treat his tuberculosis."
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,259.483,260.25,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,260.25,262.801,"But that's pure speculation, isn't it?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,262.801,269.493,And this gentleman did spend five months in a civilian hospital in Lincoln because of his burns before.
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,275.489,278.405,"Well, all you want is to have the injunction lifted?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,278.405,283.087,We would like to have -- of course we would like to have a rule.
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,288.801,291.843,"And if you can get a rule beyond that, so much the better?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,291.843,292.771,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,292.771,315.162,"Well, I suppose both parties, if there weren't the case or controversy requirement of Article III would like a ruling, since any district judge sitting in Nebraska is going to see that the Eighth Circuit, when it does have an actual case or controversy, will probably rule the way the three -- judge court did."
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,315.162,315.512,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,315.512,322.375,"But that doesn't remove the Article III requirement so far as we're concerned, nor so far as it is concerned."
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,322.375,327.938,We are -- we only have three district judges in Nebraska; two of them are on this court.
1979.78-1155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,327.938,331.847,"Well, why did the three-judge court think this case wasn't moot?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,335.329,336.821,They took the --
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.821,347.108,"They just assumed that because he was on parole and he had violated his parole, that the case wasn't moot; is that all they did?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,347.108,349.107,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,349.107,349.882,"Well, at the time he --"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,349.882,353.997,Because the injunction ran for as long as he was subject to our custody.
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,353.997,357.745,"Well, let me clarify the question I put to you at the outset."
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,367.913,375.004,"He was still in the three-judge--or excuse me, he was still in the Illinois hospital; yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,375.004,383.94,But the situation has changed significantly since then by reason of his escape and then his apprehension?
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,383.94,384.374,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,384.374,388.582,So he's back where he was before this controversy ever arose.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,388.582,392.967,"Except that he's not now in the -- yes, he's back where he was before it ever arose."
1979.78-1155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.849,499.416,May I ask you a question before you sit down?
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,499.416,501.705,"Excuse me, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.78-1155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.705,504.888,I -- when was the decision made on mootness?
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,511.379,511.552,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.552,516.288,"And as I read the opinion, he was not in Danville, but he was then on parole, wasn't he?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,526.978,532.082,"He was on parole, but his parole was a limited parole to Danville."
1979.78-1155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.885,556.273,That he'd violated his parole?
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,556.273,557.692,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.692,559.891,But he was on parole?
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,559.891,561.324,"He was on parole, yes."
1979.78-1155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.324,562.36,He was on parole.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,562.639,564.547,As far as the three-judge court was concerned.
1979.78-1155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.421,567.088,But they --
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,567.088,571.458,"But they just thought that because they'd entered this injunction, for as long as he was under Nebraska's custody."
1979.78-1155,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.458,583.833,"No, they said Larry Jones is now on parole, but he is subject to and under the threat of transfer to the state mental hospital for examination, study and treatment."
1979.78-1155,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,591.736,598.79,"Plus the fact that the state asserted the right to transfer him to a hospital on short notice, didn't it?"
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,600.848,601.49,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.49,606.865,"Well, it seeks -- of course it's always sought to have that right, long before the injunctive proceedings."
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,606.865,607.679,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,607.679,618.679,"If we vacate -- just -- if we vacate this as moot, then I take it if you did try to transfer him, he could--his lawyer could no doubt go into court and get a temporary restraining order right away on the authority of this opinion."
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,618.679,622.356,"I'm sure he could; yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.884,626.782,Which is true or any other prisoner?
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,626.782,628.164,It would be now.
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.164,629.457,Unless you have a new --
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,629.457,630.972,Unless we have some new rule.
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.972,632.265,Or a new district court judge.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,632.265,634.008,We'll be fighting this thing forever.
1979.78-1155,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.008,642.288,Or unless you have a new district court judge in Nebraska who interprets the constitution differently than this three-judge court did.
1979.78-1155,0,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,642.288,642.816,That's right.
1979.78-1155,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,655.2,660.487,Very well.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,661.872,666.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,685.941,690.086,"Well, does that question arise until they try to do it?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,690.086,692.479,"Well, it arose--they did do it, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,692.479,695.908,"He's now in a penal institution, isn't he, a prison?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,695.908,698.645,He has been sent back to the penal institution.
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,698.645,699.803,"Well, then, what's the question?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,699.803,711.791,"Our contention is, Your Honor, this is still a very viable and live controversy, for the reason that he is still under the threat, as the district court found below, of being transferred back."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,711.791,722.539,Would you say that he's still under a threat that if he develops tuberculosis he might be transferred to a hospital for treatment of tuberculosis?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,722.539,726.949,"That might be true, Your Honor, but that is not precisely the issue we face here today in Court."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.949,732.052,How is this case different from Weinstein against Bradford?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,732.052,733.962,I'm not familiar with that case?
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,733.962,748.013,"Well, that was the case where there had been an injunction entered by, I think, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit against certain prison practices in connection with parole, and meanwhile, the man's parole expired."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,761.067,767.025,"Well, for one, Larry Jones is not on parole. So therefore his parole had not expired."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.482,777.204,But he hasn't been transferred to the mental hospital.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,777.204,785.069,"He would be transferred, it is our contention, but for the fact that a three-judge federal panel has entered an injunction."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.069,786.642,"Well, but that's not what your opponent says."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,790.561,804.144,"Well, if this injunction, that we have from the three-judge federal panel, were to be dissolved by this Court, or by the three-judge federal panel, we have no doubt that he would be transferred back, he could be transferred back to the mental hospital."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,804.144,806.67,"He could be, but would he?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,806.67,809.17,"Well, I can't see into the future, Your Honor; I don't have a crystal ball."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.17,810.819,"No, none of us can."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,810.819,820.802,"But it seems to be one of those cases which seems to be capable of repetition, yet it would be evading review if this Court would not decide that issue here today."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.802,829.128,"Well, what if as far as you could tell or any doctor could tell, your client was completely cured?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,836.978,839.108,"Well, he isn't just any other inmate."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,839.108,839.6,All right.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,845.07,846.209,It's happened to him before.
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,846.209,846.846,And his condition hasn't changed?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,846.846,850.354,"He sat over there -- that's right, he sat over there for nine months."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.628,880.037,"Well, you can't--you won't cure the collateral consequence that's already happened in this case?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,880.037,881.146,That's true.
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.062,901.926,"But to have a live controversy, you must say that the risk of his being transferred again is real enough to call it a case or controversy."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,901.926,903.564,"Yes, I would agree with that statement, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.096,923.631,"Mr. Kammerlohr told us I think earlier that he had escaped, was it from Illinois to Arkansas, and has now been returned to prison in Nebraska."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,929.73,943.282,"Well, as I understand the factual situation -- and I must say that it is somewhat murky, because Mr. Jones was having some mental problems at the time, and frankly, he cannot really remember some of the things that happened."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,966.757,968.35,Maybe he's a sun worshipper.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,970.885,972.552,"Well, I don't know; he might be."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.889,991.192,We didn't say it was moot.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,991.192,994.826,"Well, I -- excuse me, it was remanded to consider mootness."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1049.018,1052.909,"Now, come back to my question, which I'm not sure you addressed yet."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1067.45,1069.659,"That would depend on two things, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1088.306,1092.742,"Yes, but being a Christian Scientist is not part of my hypothetical."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1098.273,1102.74,I would argue that he would have the right to refuse that medical treatment.
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1102.74,1112.039,"Well, my question is Must there be a hearing before he is moved from the prison to the hospital for the treatment of his tuberculosis?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1112.039,1117.883,"Well, the statute in Nebraska does not specifically provide for that now at this time."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1117.883,1125.99,"Do you think the constitution does, the Federal constitution?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1125.99,1128.412,I don't know that that issue has really been addressed.
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.766,1151.345,But your claim here is that the Nebraska statutes themselves put some preconditions on a transfer to a mental institution.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1151.345,1152.739,"Well, there are conditions."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1155.265,1157.512,"Well, I know, but they require it."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1157.512,1158.406,"Yes, they require it."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.406,1165.897,And then there must be a finding that he has a mental disease or defect before he may be transferred to the hospital; isn't that right?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1165.897,1166.559,That's correct.
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.212,1173.247,"Well, I understand that; I understand that."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1186.691,1188.623,We would hope that they would make some type of a determination.
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.623,1191.274,"Well, the statute requires it."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1194.401,1195.317,"Well, we need a further safeguard, that's what we're saying."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.317,1200.296,"-- that because the statute requires it, there should be a hearing about it."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1200.296,1204.564,"Well, what I meant was that the statute requires it, that therefore we have a hearing."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.802,1217.25,You're saying --
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1217.25,1219.358,There ought to be a better hearing.
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1219.358,1242.071,"You're saying, in effect, that the state provision gives you a state right to have some sort of a hearing before you're transferred, and that because the state gives you that much of a right, the constitution requires you--the state to go further and to have more amplified hearing proceedings?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1242.071,1242.39,No.
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.85,1264.142,"Well, that was the district court's basis, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.142,1264.483,That's certainly --
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1264.483,1264.807,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.807,1267.637,-- the narrowest way for you to win.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1267.678,1267.801,I agree.
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.801,1272.042,-- I don't know why you want to climb a higher hill than you have to.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1272.042,1283.688,"I guess I'm on that hill, Your Honor, because it may appear from reading that opinion that that is why the district court found in our favor, that they said that there was an expectation that he did have this."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.375,1291.202,Or something created by state law?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1291.202,1291.751,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1330.844,1349.491,"You say that even though the state of Nebraska required no finding by a physician, and simply left it in the discretion of prison officials to transfer an inmate to a mental hospital, that he would have a constitutional right to a hearing before that could be done?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1349.491,1350.585,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.662,1369.903,"But it does -- the statutory scheme also requires the physician's review in the case of a transfer to a mental hospital, does it not?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1369.903,1370.635,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.846,1401.317,Even though he's already been sentenced for a criminal conviction?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1401.317,1403.918,"Well, that doesn't have anything to do with it."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1409.792,1422.921,"Well, we've held, certain in Meachum v. Fano, that the transfer from one prison to another doesn't give rise to any constitutional right."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1422.921,1423.796,"Yes, that's correct."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.433,1452.374,"Mr. Wurtz, will you identify the injunction that is still in effect?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1483.743,1486.701,"Yes, Your Honor, it's my understanding that the injunction is still left."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.701,1496.464,"If that's still in effect, your client can't be transferred without the hearing that's described in that injunction, can he?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1496.464,1497.47,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.47,1498.807,"Well, why are you complaining?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1501.711,1502.0,Yes.
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.0,1502.944,You're defending that injunction?
1979.78-1155,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1502.944,1503.785,You're not complaining.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1505.758,1506.076,Right.
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.93,1511.604,But I thought you were arguing that the case is not moot.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1515.306,1516.217,"Well, no, because --"
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.217,1517.834,"You'd have the injunction, wouldn't you?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1517.834,1525.083,"-- because it's my understanding of the mootness rule here in the Supreme Court, that if a Supreme Court found a case moot, it would be -- vacated the lower injunction."
1979.78-1155,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1525.083,1526.124,I guess you're right.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1527.147,1528.308,I guess that's what I was afraid of last time.
1979.78-1155,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1528.308,1529.27,Right.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1529.27,1531.178,We're happy that the injunction was reinstated.
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.178,1537.494,"And you don't want to have to go back in court if they move him over to Lincoln, Nebraska again."
1979.78-1155,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1544.58,1546.254,Or if they start to move him?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1546.254,1549.435,"Well, that is correct."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.999,1562.866,Do you think there's no state remedy in this area?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1562.866,1564.082,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1566.516,1568.435,"Well, why do you think there's no state court remedy?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1568.435,1576.092,"Well, because habeas corpus, which we thought would be one of our only remedies, which we talked about last time, did not appear to lie in this type of case."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1586.878,1594.63,"Well, don't Nebraska, the Nebraska state courts, entertain a challenge on the Federal constitutional grounds?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1594.63,1595.745,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.096,1608.317,"This is a state statute which, I take it from these papers, that it's never been construed by the state courts."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1608.317,1609.277,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1609.277,1613.785,They might construe it just the way you want it construed; isn't that so?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1613.785,1616.821,"That is a possibility, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.969,1637.992,Maybe you could have got it through the state courts in 18 months.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1637.992,1641.017,"Well, it would -- I don't know if we could have or we couldn't have, your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1644.396,1651.443,"You mean that the state courts would not enforce the federal constitution, or consider your constitutional attack?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1651.443,1652.944,"No, I didn't say that, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.849,1673.644,"Mr. Wurtz, I realize--Jones was convicted of robbery, I believe, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1674.268,1674.842,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1674.842,1679.187,The statute applies to people in custody of the Department of Corrections.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1687.123,1689.418,That would depend on where they're placed.
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.418,1700.787,But would a conviction of a misdemeanor entitle the judge to sentence the misdemeanant to the custody of the Department of Corrections?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1700.787,1702.984,"Yes, Yes, Your Honor, I believe it would."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.984,1711.244,So this statutory scheme would authorize transfer of such a person as well as a felon to a mental institution?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1711.244,1712.381,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.913,1742.235,Would you refresh my recollection?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1757.287,1758.654,I wish I knew.
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.35,1807.502,Not enough people.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1807.502,1807.805,--there wasn't enough people.
1979.78-1155,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1807.805,1811.516,Five or six people is not enough for a class action in anybody's book.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1811.516,1812.731,"It would all depend, though, Your Honor--"
1979.78-1155,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1812.731,1815.504,Ten is not enough.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1823.964,1826.469,"Of course, it depends on how you define the class."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.651,1861.868,"Well, not only that, but that--you must concede that all 1,300 of them didn't have a case or controversy with the state over the validity of that statute."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1865.309,1868.186,"Well, I understand the reasons --"
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.186,1869.895,You must concede that.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1869.895,1870.88,"Well, no, I'm not --"
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.88,1871.43,You don't concede anything.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1871.43,1877.485,"--going to concede anything, because I always get into trouble when I concede things, I found out, particularly in this Court."
1979.78-1155,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1889.933,1891.738,It could be because you're arguing it.
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.738,1907.75,"And you could also argue that the two million people who live in Nebraska are under a somewhat more attenuated threat of committing a crime, being convicted for it, being confided to the prison system, and then suffering this fate."
1979.78-1155,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1907.75,1911.723,"Well, and the other 228 million people in the United States who might go to Nebraska."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1911.723,1912.508,Who might move to Nebraska.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1914.616,1916.162,"Well, maybe."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.842,1921.482,"You won't even concede that, will you?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1923.093,1921.482,[Laughter]
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1928.561,1930.946,"Mr. Wurtz, my recollection is that your client has a sentence that runs into the eighties, what is it, '82, or--?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1930.946,1933.025,"Yes, his parole is set for 1982."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1970.984,1979.644,Are they worse than his efforts to set himself on fire?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,1979.644,1994.281,"Your Honor, I really don't concede either--and I'm not trying to be smart about that--but I don't concede it, because I don't think it's on the record, and I don't think the state really made a prima facie case that he did set himself on fire and tried to commit suicide."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.281,2007.222,"But in Nebraska, in Weinstein against Bradford, the man had already suffered what the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit felt was unconstitutional harm."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2022.246,2029.269,"Well, I think there's a grave difference, though--there may be a fine difference--between the types of collateral consequences."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.477,2041.936,"Well, isn't --"
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.936,2046.092,"Mr. Wurtz, I'd like to follow through on that a little bit."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2070.866,2079.545,"It would seem to me, Your Honor, that the gist of psychiatric medicine right now is trying to come along to those lines."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2084.853,2090.569,"Well, obviously, from your argument, I'm afraid you haven't."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2090.569,2094.666,"Well, I don't--I haven't come that far."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2110.953,2120.919,"I'm just disturbed about your constant reference to stigma, because I think stigma in 1979 is far less than it was in 1900."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.919,2133.552,"I also think it might help to try to win your case for your client on the narrowest possible grounds, which we usually turn to if they're the narrowest grounds."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2151.869,2157.657,"Well, I think if this Court would feel that it hasn't gotten close to that ground, it perhaps ought to."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2158.44,2163.727,I'm just suggesting to you that a narrower -- a much narrower ground that you argue in your brief.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2167.609,2168.072,The expectation --
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.072,2171.132,Are you defending the three -- judge court opinion or aren't you?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2171.132,2172.255,"Yes, I'm defending that opinion."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.255,2174.333,"Well, why don't you stick to it?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2174.333,2180.467,"Well, because, had I written the opinion, I felt the court didn't have to go on that narrow of a ground."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.109,2187.318,"What do you mean, they didn't have to?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2204.642,2206.525,"Well, I don't teach constitutional law."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.525,2208.788,"Well, apparently you don't."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2213.455,2216.245,"No, that's not my argument, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.345,2252.094,But the fact is you've got a state statute that puts conditions-- that imposes preconditions that depends on the ascertainment--that depends on facts.
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2260.472,2262.357,"No, that's the statute."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.357,2265.679,"And that is the basis on which the three-judge court proceeded, is it not?"
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2265.679,2266.316,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.877,2274.104,But you don't want to make that argument?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2274.104,2275.917,"No, I was going to get to it."
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.517,2334.736,"Well, all I meant to say was that you were arguing that must because it may be thought chic in some perhaps metropolitan areas for a person to have a psychiatrist, it was not viewed that way in most of Nebraska."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2334.736,2335.055,Right.
1979.78-1155,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2355.181,2360.735,Does the constitution vary -- federal constitutional right -- vary from state to state?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2371.735,2373.547,"Clearly not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2401.435,2409.018,"If lawyers keep coming up to this Court saying it's a stigma, they probably will help to keep it a stigma, too."
1979.78-1155,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.018,2412.412,It's more of a stigma than being in a state penitentiary?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2412.412,2412.494,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2412.494,2415.263,In a small town?
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2415.263,2417.319,"No, I can't answer that."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2500.065,2501.689,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Wurtz."
1979.78-1155,1,43490,thomas_a_wurtz,,2501.689,2503.731,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2503.731,2504.52,Do you have anything further?
1979.78-1155,2,36147,melvin_kent_kammerlohr,,2504.52,2505.888,"I have nothing further, Your Honor."
1979.78-1155,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.888,2506.552,"Thank you, gentlemen."
