2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.96,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-935, Monasky versus Taglieri. Mr. Tayrani."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,7.96,23.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction is designed to protect children who have a country of habitual residence from the harmful effects of wrongful removal from that country."
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.0,143.56,Mr. Tay --
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,143.56,144.32,-- on that issue.
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.32,160.6,"-- Tayrani, a -- a problem with your position, I take it your view is this child, taken to the United States at eight weeks old, has no habitual residence?"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,160.6,162.4,"That is our position, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,162.4,169.96,"And if that's so, then there are many children who would not be covered by the Convention."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,185.0,198.52,"With respect, I disagree with the proposition that our approach would lead to a large number of children who do not have a country of habitual residence. First of all, we're talking in this case only about infants."
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,242.48,263.08,"The problem with the -- a standard that says if you -- the parents have to have an agreement, in many of these cases, the relationship between the parents is so acrimonious that the likelihood of -- of a actual agreement is slim to none."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,263.08,270.96,"That would only be the case, Your Honor, if the acrimony was simultaneous with the pregnancy and birth."
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,285.88,293.56,So you think this agreement is irrevocable? If there's a -- I doubt that there are going to be very many cases where there's a written agreement.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,316.24,318.92,"That's exactly our approach, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,339.08,348.6,"Counsel, we're -- we're talking about an international convention, and yet none of the other parties to the Convention have adopted your position."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,366.2,373.32,"Your Honor, every circuit that has addressed this issue applies some version of the shared parental intent standard to infants."
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,382.0,388.44,"Well, but I'm -- you don't dispute the fact that no other country, no other signatory to the Convention, has adopted your position?"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,388.44,389.92,"I don't dispute that, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,434.88,443.64,"But how did you get that out of -- I read Chief Justice Hale's opinion, and it seems to me that she made a huge point that this is family law."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,490.56,490.88,"Well, there need --"
2019.18-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.88,493.16,That's -- that's basically what I got out of her opinion.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,498.72,513.64,"Your Honor, the U.K. Supreme Court makes clear that while an all relevant circumstances test is generally appropriate, in the case of an infant, the infant's connections to her environment are formed through her primary caregiver."
2019.18-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.64,515.48,"Well, that may be in some cases."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,546.8,563.36,"Your Honor, the U.K. Supreme Court follows the approach of the European Union Court of Justice in the Mercredi decision, and Mercredi makes very clear that, in cases involving infants, a primary caregiver focused approach is the test that should be applied."
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,570.76,582.2,"Can I ask you a question about your position that somewhat puzzles me? You think that, in this case, the dispositive question is whether there was an agreement between the parents? Am I right?"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,582.2,583.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,583.0,586.64,And then you say that there should be review de novo.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,596.52,613.28,"It would be reviewed de novo, Your Honor, because, while historical facts would be reviewed for clear error, the application of the habitual residence standard, the actual agreement requirement to those facts, is a mixed question of law and fact."
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,613.28,622.8,"Why -- why is it a mixed question? Was there an agreement between the parents or was there not an agreement between the parents? It's a question of fact, pure fact."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,622.8,626.48,Because there does not need to be a written agreement.
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,631.04,635.92,"Well, was there a tacit agreement? It's a question of fact."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,635.92,643.04,"It is just as much a question of fact as a reasonable suspicion or probable cause determination, which this Court has held --"
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,643.04,643.24,No --
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,643.24,643.6,-- would be --
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,643.6,650.32,-- because those involve the application of a complicated legal standard.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,650.32,682.76,"Your Honor, the fact that we're here today would suggest that the habitual residence standard is less than straightforward. Lower courts are in need of guidance from appellate courts setting forth clear legal principles about how to make a habitual residence determination, just as lower courts need guidance about how to ascertain the existence of reasonable suspicion and probable cause. This Court emphasized the need for clear guidance in the Ornelas case, where it held that probable cause and reasonable suspicion are reviewed de novo. And it's not only courts that need guidance."
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.36,704.68,But over and over in the -- in the history of this Convention is that they don't want any rigid test.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,734.84,742.44,"Your Honor, the problem with that approach is that it will breed disuniform outcomes."
2019.18-935,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,792.4,792.72,On -- on your --
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,792.72,793.52,-- these cases.
2019.18-935,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,793.52,801.0,"-- on the standard of review, doesn't de novo review necessarily prolong the matter?"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,801.0,802.4,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,803.72,815.68,"Because it's going to push everything into the court of appeals then, rearguing everything that's already been decided by the district court without any deference, so people will take appeals much more readily."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,815.68,824.64,"Given the stakes in these cases, it's likely that the losing parent in the district court will appeal whatever the standard of review is."
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,851.72,853.96,"In every circuit, not the Seventh Circuit."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,853.96,859.2,"That -- that is not a case involving infants, Your Honor, the Redmond case."
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,919.32,945.84,"How -- how will it be brought to an end? The child is now in Italy, and no doubt the Italian courts would weigh in, so this -- this determination of habitual residence is not going to settle where this child -- the custody of this -- this child."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,945.84,947.2,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,982.8,991.24,"But that will depend on the Italian authorities returning her. And given the position that they've taken up until now, that seems most unlikely."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,991.24,998.08,"Your Honor, we believe as a matter of comity that the Italian courts would return A.M.T. and would adhere --"
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,998.08,1001.64,The court that has declared her a non-parent --
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1001.64,1002.2,Your Honor --
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1002.2,1004.0,-- would do that?
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1004.0,1014.2,"-- as -- as a matter of comity, we believe that the Italian courts would adhere to an order from this Court directing the re-return of A.M.T."
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.16,1037.48,Well --
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1037.48,1038.84,-- to the United States.
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1038.84,1047.92,-- there hasn't been any case where we're talking about a -- a time in the -- the other country as long as this.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1053.2,1055.44,I don't know if it is the longest period of time.
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1069.76,1075.48,Which would just delay the proceedings that have already been delayed far longer than the Convention contemplated.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1075.48,1085.16,"But, Your Honor, in the absence of a re-return order, the grave error committed by the lower courts will remain unremedied."
2019.18-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1091.84,1096.84,"But I'm not interested for the -- hypothetically, oddly enough, in the law."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1105.64,1106.68,The best interests --
2019.18-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1106.68,1116.72,"And I also think judges, particularly federal judges, don't know much about this. So, in Italy, is there a family court, or what's -- what do I do? I don't know."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1130.0,1155.4,"Your Honor, the best interests of the child would be furthered by returning A.M.T. to the United States so that there can be a full and fair child custody hearing at which a state court judge, steeped in family law issues, can make a determination about who should have custody and what is, in fact, in A.M.T.'s best interest. But, in the absence of a re-return order, no court --"
2019.18-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1155.4,1166.04,"I'm sorry, I thought that there was a special order of the Italian court giving the mother some visitation rights, albeit limited."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1179.88,1183.04,I'm not representing that there is no procedural --
2019.18-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1183.04,1205.8,"So assuming, as I do, that there has to be something that can secure greater rights for her, why should it be here instead of there, assuming -- and you don't want me to assume this -- that the totality of the circumstances suggests that she has acclimated?"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1205.8,1208.08,"Your Honor, Monasky has --"
2019.18-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1208.08,1220.2,"I mean, after two and a half years, even under the Convention, you don't have to return a child who's been settled for greater -- greater than one year."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1220.72,1223.36,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1224.76,1225.6,"No, of --"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1225.6,1226.44,-- of a re-return --
2019.18-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1226.44,1238.24,"-- of the return -- of the return, but -- but I still am wondering why it is that it's the American court, rather than the Italian court, who should be dealing with the custody issue."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1238.24,1243.64,"Well, first of all, because Italy was not A.M.T.'s country of habitual residence."
2019.18-935,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1249.68,1264.4,"Well, that -- that's a really interesting question, because I'm not sure -- unless we accept your premise that the mother's intent controls, but she was only here a couple of months when the father sought custody -- re-return of her."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1268.64,1282.92,"But, Your Honor, the question is whether A.M.T. had the type of meaningful, settled, stable existence in Italy when she was removed at eight weeks of age to establish a habitual residence there. And she must --"
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1282.92,1284.96,How old -- how old is the child now?
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1284.96,1289.0,"She is four and a half years old, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1320.16,1320.44,But --
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1320.44,1321.28,-- to the interests --
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1321.28,1325.6,-- let me understand. Your position is that she had no habitual residence at that time?
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1325.6,1326.64,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1326.64,1337.4,"Is that correct? Not that she had habitual residence -- all right. So either parent at that time could snatch her, and possession would be ten-tenths of the law, right?"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1337.4,1345.8,"The Hague Convention would not speak to that removal, Your Honor. That doesn't mean that the left-behind parent would be without remedies."
2019.18-935,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1358.44,1365.8,"But the Convention, which was meant to solve this problem of unilateral removal, would not apply?"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1365.8,1370.88,The Convention would not apply if a child had no country of habitual residence.
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1383.92,1390.64,How -- how long does the child have to -- how old does a child have to be before you would say they have a habitual residence?
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1390.64,1391.56,It --
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1391.56,1396.28,"Eight weeks under your theory is not enough, but one year, two years?"
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1396.28,1405.88,"Well, at a certain point, around 18 to 24 months, the focus would shift to the child's own acclimation to his or her surroundings, because the child --"
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.88,1407.84,Where do you get -- where do you get that number from?
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1407.84,1412.12,"Based on the development of a child, child psychology."
2019.18-935,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1458.88,1459.44,Mr. Tayrani --
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1459.44,1460.6,-- habitual residence.
2019.18-935,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1460.6,1487.36,"-- Judge Boggs suggests that in the case of children, children who have lived in a single place for their entire lives, in the case of infant children, that is, who have lived in a single country their entire lives with both parents, that the usual rule should be that's their habitual residence, not irrebuttable, but that that should be the usual rule, that that's their habitual residence. And that's certainly a very administrable rule."
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1501.72,1553.84,"The problem with that approach, Your Honor, is that it conflates a child's residence with her habitual residence. If the signatories to the Hague Convention had wanted to enact an agreement that was all encompassing, that applied to all children, they would have prohibited the removal of a child from his country of residence without the approval of both parents. What they instead did was enact a more targeted provision that prevents the wrongful removal of a child from his country of habitual residence because the signatories recognize that removing a child from a country of habitual residence, where the child has meaningful ties, has a stable existence, would be harmful to the child. But they also recognize that returning a child to a country where it lacks those ties, lacks those connections, would be just as harmful to the child's interests."
2019.18-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1605.12,1607.52,Why? That's a question I have here.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1636.36,1636.76,Mr. Chief --
2019.18-935,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1636.76,1637.72,Why isn't it here?
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1637.72,1639.2,"-- Justice, may I answer the question?"
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.2,1639.56,Yes.
2019.18-935,0,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,1639.56,1648.08,"Your Honor, we did urge the district court to apply the exception for grave risk of harm to A.M.T."
2019.18-935,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.32,1678.6,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Joshi."
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1678.6,1684.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Habitual residence is a flexible, fact-intensive concept."
2019.18-935,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1775.96,1777.04,"Well, this is what --"
2019.18-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1777.04,1777.44,When --
2019.18-935,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1777.44,1791.36,"-- puzzles me about your position, which does seem to reflect the decisions of foreign courts, and maybe something has just been lost in -- in translation. But it's -- it's fine to say take everything into account and be flexible."
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1819.68,1823.4,So we think where a child usually lives is the test.
2019.18-935,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1856.88,1872.44,"Well, what if the parents live, from the time of the child's birth until the time when the issue comes up, in a particular country, but it was never their intention to stay there permanently? Would that country be where the child usually lives?"
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1872.44,1875.4,It -- that -- that's a very difficult question.
2019.18-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1925.76,1925.88,Counsel --
2019.18-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1925.88,1931.64,"Well, that's kind of a meaningless concept, where the child usually lives, if you're talking about somebody who's eight-weeks-old."
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1931.64,1932.44,"Again, as I --"
2019.18-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1932.44,1934.48,"I mean, it's not as if they'd laid down roots."
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1934.48,1935.6,That -- that's --
2019.18-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1935.6,1942.56,"Eight-year-old -- eight-week-old infants don't have habits, well, other than one or two, but -- (Laughter.)"
2019.18-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1942.56,1947.2,-- but it doesn't seem to me that that's the notion that the Convention drafters were looking at.
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1947.2,1948.28,It -- it isn't.
2019.18-935,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1983.16,1992.0,"Well, does that mean Judge Boggs is right, that the place where an infant usually lives is the place where the infant has lived since birth with both parents?"
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,1992.0,1999.92,"Judge Boggs may well be right, and he did add the qualification for absent unusual circumstances."
2019.18-935,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1999.92,2001.2,"Absent unusual circumstances, right."
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2001.2,2002.84,And -- and I think that's perfectly fine.
2019.18-935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2028.32,2032.4,There's a -- there's a problem with your solution.
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2080.56,2084.52,"So, Justice Ginsburg, we don't take a position on the outcome of this case."
2019.18-935,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2114.16,2115.4,What would they be?
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2115.4,2117.52,"I -- I don't know, and it's hard to predict."
2019.18-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.64,2173.88,All right.
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2202.4,2212.88,"I would agree with that. And I would just -- again, I would -- I would caution this Court from laying down principles like that because, when this Court says it, lower courts usually take it as proposition of the law --"
2019.18-935,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2212.88,2213.12,Then why --
2019.18-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.12,2229.16,"Well, then, if that's so, then is -- is it the less risky path to send it back? If we say it and don't send it back, more likely to be taken as laying down propositions of law?"
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2229.16,2231.16,"That may well be true, but --"
2019.18-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.16,2232.68,What do you think?
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2232.68,2240.16,"So we -- we -- we -- we don't take a position on it, other than to say, you know, ideally, this Court's opinion will say that habitual residence is a --"
2019.18-935,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.16,2247.76,"No, you don't have to take a position, but I find it rather difficult. So can you help me? (Laughter.)"
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2247.76,2251.0,"Again, as I said, it's -- it's where the child usually lives."
2019.18-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2252.16,2263.48,"I'm sorry, where did you get that standard? I look at the European court and it had a different standard. It says some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment."
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2285.44,2293.76,"No, we're not. If I may, Mr. Chief Justice. We think they are looking at the right question, which is where the child ordinarily lives."
2019.18-935,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2295.6,2297.32,"No, that's a translation."
2019.18-935,1,63131,sopan_joshi,,2299.48,2307.4,"We -- we think the words they used are certainly relevant to that ultimate determination, and, in any event, that is what the text of the Convention says."
2019.18-935,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2310.0,2315.36,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2315.36,2330.68,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Just to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's question, I -- I think the -- the European and U.K. courts have talked about the family and social environment in which the child's life has developed."
2019.18-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2493.8,2496.04,"Which -- which, as you say, is what Judge Boggs said."
2019.18-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2518.56,2522.24,-- to do all the factors that they think ought to go into this inquiry.
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2551.84,2564.72,"Well, I don't want to resist a rule that would be beneficial to my client, but -- but I guess I will say that the -- the courts, especially in the U.K., have had a lot of experience with subsidiary legal principles like that being developed."
2019.18-935,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2590.24,2600.04,"Wouldn't all the work be done on ""absent unusual circumstances,"" though? And so you would still have the out, as Justice Kagan points out, for people to argue that it's --"
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2600.04,2618.72,"I think so, and I'm not sure, Justice Kavanaugh, that there's much difference between saying that as a legal principle or framing it the way Justice Breyer did, which is, when the facts are that the child has lived in one country with her parents for -- for her whole life, absent some unusual facts, that is going to lead to this decision."
2019.18-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2618.72,2654.72,"Well, what this ""take everything into account and be flexible"" standard seems to mean in practice -- and you tell me if this is wrong -- is there are a lot of different considerations and they may -- particular considerations may be more important in one case than in another case, so we're just going to dump this in the hands of a particular judge to make a decision that that particular judge thinks is fair in accordance with that particular judge's value judgments, and we're not going to make it -- we're going to make it very hard to get that reversed."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2662.64,2664.92,"I'm not sure that that's right, Justice Alito."
2019.18-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2688.4,2688.96,"Yeah, but there I know what --"
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2688.96,2690.24,And so I think you can lay out --
2019.18-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2690.24,2690.6,I --
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2690.6,2707.56,"-- as we -- as this colloquy indicates, you can say, for example, when you have a -- a child who has lived only in one place, there is a pretty clear factual result that's going to obtain, absent something odd. The -- the difficult cases really are these multiple country cases."
2019.18-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2715.76,2716.4,"Well, in the case of --"
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2716.4,2717.8,Those are very complicated cases.
2019.18-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2717.8,2732.0,"-- in the case of an infant, why does it matter that the -- the infant has lived all of his or her life in a particular country? That -- it wouldn't matter to that infant what country the infant was living in or whether the infant was living on the moon."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2738.08,2742.72,"Well, it matters that the infant has lived in the same country with the parents."
2019.18-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2746.04,2748.24,But what is the interest that is served by that?
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2748.24,2751.36,The interest -- there are two interests that are served.
2019.18-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2779.24,2779.6,So you --
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2779.6,2781.28,And so what the --
2019.18-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2781.28,2800.12,"-- in this case -- and it's a troublesome case because she alleged that she was abused, so you're putting that mother in the position of, if she wants to escape domestic violence, she has to leave her child behind."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2800.12,2807.12,"Well, she doesn't -- she doesn't have to -- she can escape domestic violence by separating from her husband and staying in the country."
2019.18-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.56,2839.72,Now --
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2839.72,2870.88,"That's not what the district court found here, however, because the district court found -- and just to -- to quote two findings, on Petition App. 98a, she continued after the birth of her child to live in Italy and had no definitive plans to bring her to the United States until the last altercation, which precipitated her departure. And at 94a, most of the steps that Monasky took in March 2015 seemed to reflect a settled purpose and intent to remain in Italy at least for an undetermined period of time. So the district court looked at all this and said that wasn't the case here."
2019.18-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.08,2875.6,What do we do --
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2875.6,2876.24,-- of fact and law.
2019.18-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2876.24,2880.08,"-- about -- I mean, I think in their brief they said she doesn't speak Italian and doesn't have a job."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2890.92,2891.64,Well --
2019.18-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2891.64,2897.4,"You'd think where the mother is being beaten up, that would be an intolerable situation."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2897.4,2897.64,And --
2019.18-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.64,2908.68,What do you do if the mother is in a country where there are difficulties with abused women finding adequate care and she's got to get out of there?
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2908.68,2910.2,"Well, I think that --"
2019.18-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2910.2,2911.2,All right.
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2913.24,2920.64,"As I say, I think that could be a -- a relevant fact that might lead the general rule that we're talking about --"
2019.18-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2920.64,2921.16,Do we put it --
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2921.16,2921.92,-- to be superseded.
2019.18-935,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2921.92,2929.12,"-- in here, or do you say in dicta or something that it was raised, an intolerable situation includes that, or do we say nothing at all?"
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2929.12,2962.4,"Well, there are two options for addressing that, right? One -- one is to say that, if the district court were to find that the mother was trying to get away and her -- she had a -- at the quickest possible moment, but she was thwarted because the father was preventing it through abuse or otherwise, then that might well mean that there's no habitual residence. That is not, as I -- the findings that I read, that's not the case here. You could also look to the Article 13 exception and talk about the possibility that -- that those facts may be relevant."
2019.18-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2963.64,2964.04,But that --
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2964.04,2964.96,"-- noted, that was --"
2019.18-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2964.96,2967.16,-- isn't Article 13 about abuse of the child?
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2967.16,2975.32,"It is about abuse of the child, and so that is -- that requires a broader finding, that the -- so it may be that the -- the first approach is a better one."
2019.18-935,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2975.32,2975.6,Can I --
2019.18-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2975.6,3013.72,"Let me ask you a question about the difference between you and the government. You -- you, I thought, urged that shared parental intent is relevant but not dispositive, one factor among others to be weighed. But, if that is the case, doesn't that suggest the government's position, a remand, because at least the majority of the Sixth Circuit seems to focus on this shared parental intent?"
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3013.72,3059.04,"Well, let me -- let me answer that in two ways if I may, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, I think it's important to unpack the phrase ""shared parental intent."" I think the way the lower courts, as we discuss in our brief, the low -- the way the lower courts of the United States have applied that is what's the intent of each parent that can be proven by words, deeds, objectively, what's the -- what is the parents' intent with respect to the location of the child? That none -- there's perhaps one case in which a -- a federal court of appeals indicated that -- that a meeting of the minds might be necessary, and even that court relied on an alternative ground. So I think the -- the question is, is the intent of the parents with respect to where the child lives relevant? I think, yes, it can be proved they don't have to have jointly agreed."
2019.18-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3115.16,3131.96,"When you and, to the extent you know it, the SG, talk about totality of the circumstances, for older children, does that mean rejecting the view of most of the circuit courts that the key thing is acclimatization?"
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3131.96,3137.24,"No, I think acclimatization, as children get older, can be highly relevant."
2019.18-935,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3141.68,3145.52,"Well, but I think most courts have done more than just say that's highly relevant."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3169.48,3179.68,I -- I think the problem is there's no bright line between when you might think the young child standard applies and when you might think acclimatization becomes relevant.
2019.18-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3207.64,3208.4,Isn't that what the European --
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3208.4,3209.08,-- a dividing line there.
2019.18-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3209.08,3223.12,-- isn't that what the European court said with respect to infants? It didn't say that you put parental intent or agreement as being the most important.
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3226.48,3227.04,I think that's --
2019.18-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3227.04,3227.56,-- was their language.
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3227.56,3228.56,"-- that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2019.18-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3228.56,3245.72,"So how do I discern that the mother's intent was to stay in Italy or that the child had acclimated to Italy or integrated into Italy when the child was being -- during those eight weeks, she was moved from one spot to another."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3248.84,3250.8,"Well, she moved between two places."
2019.18-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3250.8,3254.68,"Between two places, but the father wasn't in the first place."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3277.16,3278.44,"Well, I think those -- sorry."
2019.18-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3278.44,3286.8,So why couldn't a court reasonably conclude that no settled place --
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3286.8,3287.32,Well --
2019.18-935,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3287.32,3303.28,"-- no ordinary place had yet been formed for this child? That's a possibility we haven't talked about. But I have to presume that if we tell a court that it's the totality of the circumstances, that is, in fact, one of the options it has."
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3303.28,3304.64,I -- I think it is.
2019.18-935,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3367.48,3376.24,But what about the -- the -- this ex parte declaration depriving her of her parental rights? That's still standing.
2019.18-935,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3376.24,3380.04,I think that's one of the issues that will be adjudicated in this Italian proceeding.
2019.18-935,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3481.12,3484.6,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Tayrani."
2019.18-935,3,63203,amir_c_tayrani,,3484.6,3485.48,Thank you.
2019.18-935,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3606.76,3607.68,"Thank you, counsel."
