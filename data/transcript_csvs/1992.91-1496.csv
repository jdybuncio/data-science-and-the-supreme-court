1992.91-1496,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.522,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-1496, Peter C. Reiter v. Langdon M. Cooper."
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,12.974,15.776,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,43.41,44.612,Which was the filed rate.
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,44.612,45.495,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1992.91-1496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,45.495,47.314,Which was the filed rate.
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,47.314,55.485,"That was the filed rate, yes, Your Honor, the one that petitioners take the position and argue in defense that it was unreasonably high."
1992.91-1496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,91.074,108.369,"Is it your position that even if the carrier filed, charged, sent a bill for the filed rate and the shipper said the rate is unreasonable, should that defense await a ruling by the--"
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,108.369,111.154,"No, no, Justice White, that defense should not await a ruling."
1992.91-1496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,112.173,112.773,--Why not?
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,112.773,128.449,"--Section 10743, a separate provision, separate from the filed rate doctrine which is embodied in section 10761(a), specifically provides that the carrier has a right to insist upon payment at the time of the movement of the goods."
1992.91-1496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,162.586,163.972,A negotiated rate was paid?
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,163.972,167.657,--A negotiated rate was paid and then a subsequent request was made.
1992.91-1496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,175.411,182.6,"But it was a rate, it was a negotiated rate that the carrier had no business charging?"
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,182.6,182.934,That's true.
1992.91-1496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,188.071,190.138,Didn't the shipper also?
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,190.138,200.145,"No, if you... the provision, section 19761 and 10762 both provide that it is the carrier's duty to comply with the law."
1992.91-1496,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.055,224.661,"Well, Mr. Phillips, I guess the shipper would have access to the public information to know whether the rate had been filed or not."
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,224.661,249.692,"It is true in a theoretical sense that the shipper has access, but I think it is as a practical matter quite unreasonable to expect the shipper to be able consistently to monitor changing tariff rates that can be implemented on 24-hours notice, when if you were to just look at the Carolina tariffs they are six volumes long, they reference additional tariffs that are themselves three and four volumes long."
1992.91-1496,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.846,269.32,May I ask whether your client was time-barred from seeking reparations at the time that the respondents here first tried to collect the alleged undercharges?
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,270.872,274.891,"As to some portions they would have been, some of the earlier shipments I think would have been barred."
1992.91-1496,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.833,298.589,And does the time barr affect the ability under your position to go back to the ICC for the reasonableness determination?
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,298.589,318.936,"Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, that is this Court's decision in United States v. Western Pacific where the Court held that where the United States refused to pay and was sued for undercharges and the carriers, the carrier in that case, just as the respondents in this case, said the way to do this is to pay the filed rate and seek reparations."
1992.91-1496,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.504,384.229,Could the bankruptcy court collect the full amount of the filed rate and just hold it until such time as you have had a reasonable opportunity to go to the ICC?
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,384.229,387.764,"The bankruptcy court, I think there's no question the bankruptcy court would have that authority."
1992.91-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.023,467.449,"Well, just before you leave that point, it's not at all clear to me that a district court or bankruptcy court can alter the priority of creditors by an equitable subordination of liens that are otherwise equal."
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,469.249,472.77,"Well, the question is whether you put it into the bankruptcy estate in the first instance."
1992.91-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.757,490.564,"Well, but if bankruptcy courts could do this they could have escrows all the time which would basically alter the provision the Congress has for the priority of creditors and for their equal right to share in proceeds."
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,490.564,490.898,--But I think--
1992.91-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.898,492.648,And I don't see where this authority comes from.
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,492.648,498.135,"--Well, it doesn't... I mean, to be honest with you I'm happy to abandon the position that there's authority to do it."
1992.91-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.227,518.232,"Well, you don't argue this in your brief and there's no citation in the brief to support the bankruptcy court's authority to do this, is there?"
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,518.232,518.599,No.
1992.91-1496,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.265,519.565,Thank you.
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,531.49,537.744,"Any one of the courts would have been fine, but yes, Your Honor, since it was tried initially before the bankruptcy court we thought the matter should have been referred to the ICC."
1992.91-1496,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.744,539.262,What authority does it have to refer it?
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,563.961,570.948,"It may well be that we are simply employing a short-hand means of accomplishing precisely what you're describing, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1496,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.755,586.224,"Well, is there a proceeding before the ICC that would enable you to do that?"
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,588.676,589.611,"Oh, yes, I mean the Interstate Commerce--"
1992.91-1496,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.611,593.897,--whereby if the court stays its hand you can get this issue before the ICC?
1992.91-1496,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,593.897,610.007,"--The Interstate Commerce Commission has a policy statement, order 177 and 208, both of which say that they will entertain these kinds of claims and resolve the question of rate reasonableness, and in fact in the Oneida case that was recently decided by the Interstate Commerce Commission that is precisely what they did do."
1992.91-1496,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.439,660.756,"Very well, Mr. Phillips."
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,666.943,669.978,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.783,709.389,"Well, what if the carrier had an effective remedy to recover reparations?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,715.276,722.679,"No, Justice White, we don't say that it would be necessary for the court to hold its hand if the shipper did have an effective remedy in reparations."
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.679,739.058,"So you would not apply, you would not apply, you would not apply primary jurisdiction where the carrier, where the shipper paid a negotiated rate that was lower than the filed rate and the carrier then sued for the balance?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,739.058,740.808,"Well, that is this case, of course."
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.808,741.26,I know it is.
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,741.26,746.762,But the reason why reparations is inadequate in this case is because the carrier is insolvent.
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.762,747.297,I understand.
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,758.12,762.089,We don't think that this case presents the Court with the requirement of ruling on it.
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.089,765.041,"I know, I know, but what's the United States' position on that?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,765.041,775.164,"The United States' position is that there isn't any need to bring the primary jurisdiction doctrine into play through a referral procedure when reparations are truly available, and that is--"
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.164,783.17,"So you do, you do not agree with the shipper here in that regard?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,783.17,786.555,"--Well, I don't think that the shipper here is taking any position that's different from that."
1992.91-1496,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.522,827.216,"You're saying, Mr. Dreeben, that then your view of the situation contemplates at least the possibility that the role would be different in bankruptcy than outside of bankruptcy?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,827.216,833.786,"Justice, Chief Justice Rehnquist, we don't think the rule has to be different depending on the fact of bankruptcy or not."
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.097,883.868,"Mr. Dreeben, at the outset of your presentation you referred to referral to the ICC is necessary for three reasons, and you repeated the referral."
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,887.404,893.408,"We mean, Justice Scalia, the same thing that Mr. Phillips described, and this Court has used the same sort of short-hand."
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.501,915.257,"But it's up to the parties to take the initiative to go before the agency, and up to the agency to accept that proceeding or not?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,915.257,929.414,"Well, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a court sua sponte concluding that the issue, that the case raised an issue that it could not decide and that an agency had to decide, and staying its proceedings to give the parties an opportunity to do so."
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.109,957.351,"But all we're really talking about is a stay of proceedings which the bankruptcy court undoubtedly has the power to achieve, and the issue is simply whether it's appropriate in this situation or not."
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,957.351,959.869,That is exactly what the issue is.
1992.91-1496,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,967.939,987.702,"In a situation like this in which bankruptcy is the context in which the issue arises, is there any issue of discretion in your view on the part of the bankruptcy court once it determines that there is a genuine issue about the reasonableness of the rates?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,987.702,988.036,--No.
1992.91-1496,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.036,995.375,Would it be an abuse of discretion to fail to stay in other words if there is no question about the genuineness of the issue of reasonableness?
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,995.375,995.708,Yes.
1992.91-1496,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1040.07,1045.558,Is there any question about there being a genuine claim of reasonableness here?
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1046.875,1054.914,"--The issue wasn't resolved at any, in the lower courts at all, and we think that the case should be returned to the lower courts for them to address it."
1992.91-1496,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1055.681,1057.783,"I guess you said that in your brief, actually, didn't you?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1057.783,1058.633,"--That's correct, Justice Souter."
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.485,1112.581,"Mr. Dreeben, what if it comes out in the proceedings before the bankruptcy court that the shipper in fact was the only shipper who was getting this special rate and that he and the carrier colluded and the carrier said look, we're charging everybody else, all your competitors, this excessive unreasonable rate, but you we're going to give a fair rate to."
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1120.604,1123.723,"Yes, I think that the issue should still go to the Interstate Commerce Commission."
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.44,1154.177,So you say the ICC might just simply refuse to entertain the proceeding for equitable... could it do that?
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1154.177,1154.61,Certainly.
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.579,1215.966,How do you frame the threshold test for the reference to the agency?
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1223.172,1238.931,The general principle we're contending for today is that under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction when the carrier is insolvent the reasonableness defense would be worthless and meaningless unless there is a stay of proceedings and an opportunity for the Commission--
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.931,1239.783,So it turns on the carrier's solvency?
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1239.783,1241.416,"--In this context, yes."
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.86,1285.229,"Mr. Dreeben, this is an automatic referral?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1301.439,1302.957,I'll answer your second question first.
1992.91-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.957,1303.391,Okay.
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1303.391,1314.513,It has taken approximately 2.5 years for the Interstate Commerce Commission to formulate its basic standard of what it is going to use for reasonableness claims.
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.58,1345.365,And say that the shipper pay up.
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1345.365,1347.051,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1992.91-1496,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1354.788,1357.157,"Mr. Dreeben... go ahead, you didn't answer the first question."
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1357.157,1372.832,"--As to your first question, Justice Scalia, whether referral should be automatic no matter how transparently flimsy or false the claim of unreasonableness is, the answer to that is no, and I think that this is just a classic example of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction at work."
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.753,1472.615,"You don't suggest, though, that if the carrier has charged the filed rate that the shipper can just raise the defense of unreasonableness unless there's some claim that he can't get reparations?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1472.615,1482.738,"--That's absolutely correct, Justice White, and again the shipper cannot use this as a way to avoid payment of the filed rate at the time of shipment because there is an--"
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.738,1483.771,Even if he thinks it's unreasonable.
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1483.771,1484.856,--Even if he thinks it's unreasonable.
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.856,1486.356,Even if there's a pretty good case for it.
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1486.356,1487.041,That's correct.
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.936,1525.648,"Well, what happens to the rule that you have to pay when the service is rendered if the shipper claims, well, I know that rule and the carrier is charging me the filed rate, but nevertheless the time for reparations has passed?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1525.648,1527.131,"Well, if the time for reparations--"
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.131,1528.449,"What happens, what happens then?"
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1528.449,1536.905,--Then it's clear under this Court's decision in United States v. Western Pacific that the case must be referred to the Commission.
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.905,1541.84,Despite this statutory provision that you've got to pay.
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1541.84,1546.144,The statutory provision applies at the time the goods are delivered.
1992.91-1496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1546.144,1546.561,"Yes, exactly."
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1546.561,1552.231,"Now, reparations can be asserted for 2 years under the statute of limitations in the Interstate Commerce Act."
1992.91-1496,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.092,1578.798,But if you have a negotiated rate I suppose the shipper complies with the pay provision by simply paying the negotiated price?
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1578.798,1584.352,"That's true, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and the shipper does that because that's what the carrier is billing him."
1992.91-1496,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.352,1586.186,That's what they both think they are talking about.
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1586.186,1586.638,That's right.
1992.91-1496,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.66,1597.327,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1992.91-1496,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1597.327,1598.127,Thank you.
1992.91-1496,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.127,1601.345,Or would have been.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1604.364,1608.399,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.127,1684.666,But the duty to pay the... you're not talking about a violation of the obligation to pay when shipped?
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1687.201,1687.451,--Yes.
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1691.653,1705.812,"Well, but surely the duty to pay when shipped, if there has been a negotiated rate and both the trucker and the shipper have agreed to the negotiated rate, that can't, that is never going to be enforced beyond the negotiated rate."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1705.812,1707.995,The statute in its section 1074--
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.995,1709.43,I mean as a practical matter.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1709.43,1713.882,"--Well, as a practical matter the shipper has constructive knowledge and they best check--"
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.882,1727.059,"As a practical matter when the trucker agrees to ship for a certain amount and the shipper agrees to pay a certain amount, that's what the parties expect and so that's what payment will be made, isn't it?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1727.059,1732.63,"--That may be what payment will be made, but that has no legal significance under the law and the precedent of this Court's opinions."
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.934,1743.485,But that's a total abstraction in the real world.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1743.485,1746.687,"--Your Honor, whether it's an abstraction or not, it's the law."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.236,1791.918,"Well, what do you, what do you do to the assertions that the filed rate can't be collected or need not be collected until the ICC gets to pass on it if there's no reasonable way of getting reparations?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1791.918,1796.453,I say that's without any statutory support.
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.92,1800.774,"Well, what about, what do you do about Western Pacific?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1800.774,1802.94,--Western Pacific is a Tucker Act case.
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.444,1814.598,"Well, it may be a Tucker Act case, but they were just trying to collect a higher rate than had been charged to the United States."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1814.598,1819.65,"Yes, but all parties conceded that the United States had a unique right of set-off."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.904,1832.124,I thought Western Pacific applied the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1832.124,1834.141,--Western Pacific... the doctrine of primary--
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.141,1834.91,Is that right or not?
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1834.91,1838.627,"--Your Honor, part of the holding was indeed applying primary jurisdiction."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.396,1844.865,And among other things to have the ICC decide reasonableness.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1844.865,1851.019,"It was reasonableness as applied to determine which of two applicable filed rate applied, Justice White."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.554,1857.073,"Well, they didn't make the United States pay the filed rate."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,1857.073,1860.791,"--Only because, only because it didn't have to under the Tucker Act."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.733,2065.251,"Again, what if reparations are not available?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2065.251,2068.989,Reparations are always available within the statutory scheme.
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.589,2081.962,"Well, maybe reparations, maybe you could say, maybe you could say that the ICC could decide... what would you do, bring a suit for reparations?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2081.962,2084.998,That's the way... the statutory scheme is you do bring a suit for reparations.
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.998,2085.531,"Yes, all right."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2088.966,2092.853,"Well, first of all, we don't know that it can never be collected because in bankruptcies there are payments."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.822,2107.178,"So you think the shipper should pay the filed rate, pay up and then file a claim like any other?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2107.178,2112.982,"Absolutely, because, Your Honor, that's the only way to prevent discrimination."
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2159.563,2164.966,But that would be true in any action for reparations out of bankruptcy.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2179.809,2192.034,"--I agree, Your Honor, except that they... no, not totally, because once that reparations action was brought, the date that is filed any other shipper that desired to file it would have that same right at that point in time."
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.487,2234.676,"The Government said the ICC took 2.5 years to determine what policy it, how it would treat these."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2238.378,2241.746,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that, I understand that, but let's--"
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.746,2245.816,"Well, if you understood it then you just misstated it."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2245.816,2259.958,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the point I'm making is that we don't know that the day after a solvent carrier, that the Government says that the reparations scheme is different when you're involving a solvent carrier, we don't know that that carrier is going to be solvent tomorrow or the next day."
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.449,2276.003,"Yes, but none of the solvent carriers brought any of these lawsuits, none of them were brought until they went into bankruptcy, did they?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2276.003,2277.586,"Well, I don't know that that is exactly true."
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.472,2283.406,"Well, are there any cases that you know of where solvent carriers are the plaintiff?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2283.406,2284.875,--In fact I do know of one.
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.875,2285.291,One.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2285.291,2286.475,Consolidated Freightways did bring a case.
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.475,2287.16,One out of millions.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2287.16,2289.477,"Well, that is endemic of the problem because--"
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.477,2293.964,What percentage of the total market do you think was paying the filed rate during the period in question here?
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2293.964,2299.868,"--I would say in this case, in Carolina Motor, about 97 percent of all shippers paid the filed rate charges."
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2302.903,2305.272,And it still went bankrupt.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2305.272,2306.172,It still went bankrupt.
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2306.172,2308.938,"That's one carrier, you say."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2310.24,2311.257,In the market as a whole today?
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.257,2313.909,How prevalent was this practice?
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2313.909,2316.861,"Regrettably it was prevalent, but not overwhelming."
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.861,2317.527,There are billions of dollars out there.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2317.527,2320.229,The majority of shippers still pay filed rate charges and carriers--
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.229,2321.213,The majority pay?
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2321.213,2326.633,"--I would say since this Court's opinion in Maislin there has been a reform, and certainly people have come back."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.708,2426.432,"I suppose the more illegal rate bargains there were for lower rates, the more likely it would be that the carrier would go bankrupt."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2426.432,2427.732,I would say that's probably true.
1992.91-1496,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.816,2464.005,"Of course under the bankruptcy law in your tire manufacturer hypothetical, if the tire manufacturer had a claim he could set-off any amount that was owed to the company."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2464.005,2465.457,You're saying if he had a--
1992.91-1496,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2465.457,2473.729,"So if you're talking about equivalency, the only reason there can't be a set-off here is because it's not a post-petition debt because of the reasonableness doctrine hasn't been adjudicated yet."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2473.729,2475.746,"--That is exactly right, Justice Kennedy."
1992.91-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.845,2503.915,"Only those companies that charged, all the companies that charged low rates have gone bankrupt?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2506.617,2510.486,"Not all, not all companies that have charged low rates."
1992.91-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.486,2511.688,"Just the inefficient ones, I gather, right?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2511.688,2513.038,"Well, I think there's a mix--"
1992.91-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.038,2516.306,And the efficient ones stay in business and continue to charge people low rates.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2517.39,2519.108,--I think that's what the Government is urging certainly.
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.037,2571.874,"Of course these, a lot of these cases, your position is just as strong even if there is no discrimination at all by the carrier."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2571.874,2572.674,This is true.
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2572.674,2579.23,Because if they charged just the market rate across the board your anti-discrimination policy still takes over.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2579.23,2586.2,"Well, the filed rate doctrine itself cures many ills, allegedly."
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.2,2587.583,It also creates many ills.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2589.235,2592.437,"Well, Justice Stevens, there is certainly that feeling."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.661,2696.803,"So you think, you think it's fair to say that our cases hold that a negotiated rate below the filed rate is an illegal rate?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2696.803,2700.521,Your cases hold that a negotiated rate has no legal significance.
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.854,2701.587,"Well, is it illegal?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2703.806,2705.939,"--It is, the negotiated rate is an illegal rate."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.864,2723.284,So the shipper should pay at the time the filed rate.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2723.284,2725.902,The shipper should pay at the time the filed rate.
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.837,2762.844,"Yes, but as a practical matter the shipper says to the trucker what do I owe you, and the trucker says you owe me the negotiated rate, and he delivers the goods for that."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2762.844,2765.01,As a practical matter that has no legal significance.
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2765.01,2768.062,"No, but that, that's what in effect happens, isn't it?"
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2768.062,2778.354,"That's what happened... well, in this case what happened was, and this is in the record, the trucker wrote the shipper a letter saying don't worry about our tariffs, we will handle anything that pays 90 cents a mile."
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.925,2816.912,"Well, that was not the point I was trying to make with the question, Mr. Steinfeld."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2838.158,2850.383,"--Well, I think, I understand what Your Honor is saying, and if you're taking a totally innocent shipper that isn't aware of the higher filed rate charges the position is well, he has paid, he should get the goods."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.126,2894.995,"Well, I don't, I don't know."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2904.601,2906.77,The ICC had that policy and we--
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.77,2912.974,"And they were, they were regulating this industry."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2912.974,2914.326,--Allegedly.
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.326,2914.959,"Well, allegedly."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2927.216,2932.703,"Well, this is another policy, I submit, that doesn't square with the statute because the Commission, as I said, have just changed their view."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.864,2981.768,"But we're not talking about, we're not talking about how we should treat the ICC."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2985.553,2986.422,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.422,2996.694,"--who has been, who perhaps mistakenly relied on an ICC policy."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,2996.694,2998.111,"I, the way to treat that--"
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.111,3000.08,To say nothing of the carrier.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,3000.08,3002.347,"--Well, the carrier is out of business."
1992.91-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.024,3018.141,"Post-Maislin, I hope."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,3018.141,3018.657,Yes.
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3022.511,3023.528,I don't know why.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,3029.699,3032.617,"I can appreciate that comment as well, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.518,3064.172,But you must admit the tariffs got a little more complicated after the motor carriers were regulated than before.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,3064.172,3066.922,"Again that's, I submit that's the ICC's doing."
1992.91-1496,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.444,3076.23,"Yeah, but they really aren't, as you well know."
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,3079.598,3082.134,I do tend to dispute Mr. Phillips in this case.
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3160.998,3165.551,But then that is like Western Pacific where the time for that has expired.
1992.91-1496,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.551,3174.323,"Now, now that the plan of liquidation has been affirmed and the stay has been lifted, obviously the time has occurred, has departed."
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.379,3205.712,Don't be too sure.
1992.91-1496,2,32771,joseph_l_steinfeld_jr,,3205.712,3208.045,--we take.
1992.91-1496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3247.289,3248.589,"Thank you, Mr. Steinfeld."
1992.91-1496,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3251.424,3252.693,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-1496,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.725,3361.878,You... that's a little bit of an overstatement.
1992.91-1496,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3382.876,3384.276,--If it is absolutely clear--
1992.91-1496,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.276,3384.859,Is that right?
1992.91-1496,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3384.859,3389.13,"--If it is absolutely clear that there is no risk in pursuing reparations, I agree with that."
1992.91-1496,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.13,3396.534,"Well, then you do, then you did, you had to have had a duty to pay the filed rate."
1992.91-1496,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3396.534,3399.219,I did have... I had a duty to pay the filed rate.
