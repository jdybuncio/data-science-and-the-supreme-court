1984.84-498,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.987,We will hear arguments next in United States against National Bank of Commerce.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,11.974,23.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,124.611,126.829,"No, but they'd have a complaint against him, wouldn't they?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,126.829,134.502,"Well, they might have a complaint against him, and as I will explain shortly, they would have a very similar claim against the IRS."
1984.84-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,156.082,158.868,Supposing his wife had a big pile of cash at home.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,163.77,165.705,--If his wife had a big pile of cash?
1984.84-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,165.705,169.925,In their desk drawer at home.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,169.925,179.631,"Well, if the understanding between them was that he had free access to that money, yes, we say the IRS could levy upon it."
1984.84-498,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,193.707,204.913,"If she publicly acknowledged that he had the right, the same right that she had of access, would that affect your response?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,204.913,218.839,"Well, we think that here the equivalent of that public acknowledgment is in effect, because under state law and the banking contracts involved Roy had the right to withdraw all that money without notifying his co-depositors."
1984.84-498,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,218.839,222.091,So that's the equivalent of the other public acknowledgment?
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,222.091,224.393,"I think you could put it that way, yes."
1984.84-498,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,228.195,233.182,But under state law who owned that money?
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,233.182,248.008,"Well, the question of who owns the money in the ultimate sense is a matter of state law, and that would be determined after the levy in a post-seizure hearing, either an administrative hearing or a wrongful levy action."
1984.84-498,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,248.008,256.197,Are you saying that the ownership is immaterial to the right of the Government by administrative levy to take it?
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,256.197,267.153,"Well, the question... the resolution of all possible competing claims to the property is irrelevant at the levy stage of the proceeding."
1984.84-498,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,267.153,268.655,As long as he's got some property interest.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,268.655,274.243,"As long as he's got the right to pull that money out and write a check to the IRS for it, that's right, he has a right to property."
1984.84-498,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,274.243,275.376,That's what you're levying on.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,275.376,279.23,"That's what we're levying on, his right to withdraw the money and pay it to the IRS."
1984.84-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.23,300.31,"Mr. Lauber, if you're right and there are post-levy remedies available, I assume they're only available to the person who says you've taken my property, and that individual would have to initiate any judicial proceeding or request for administrative review?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,300.31,300.976,"Well, it depends."
1984.84-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.697,307.997,No.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,314.57,315.153,Right.
1984.84-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.153,317.688,"A mother and a sister, perhaps."
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,324.926,325.692,Exactly.
1984.84-498,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.692,330.079,"Now, how would they even have notice of it if there'd been a levy?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,333.197,349.641,"As this Court noted in the Rodgers case a few terms ago, the Revenue Code does not require the IRS to notify potential third party claimants of a levy on the taxpayer's property, and in fact the IRS does not notify them because it typically can't know who they are."
1984.84-498,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.345,383.48,They'd find out rather dramatically when they tried to draw a check on the account.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,383.48,387.682,"Well, that's the ultimate thing, is these people, one presumes they know."
1984.84-498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,397.638,415.951,"All of the claims I gather could have been resolved if the Government, instead of an administrative levy under 6331, had brought a judicial suit under 7403, would it not?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,415.951,416.901,"Well, that's correct."
1984.84-498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,416.901,425.473,"I mean, the Government... if you had done that, all parties with claims would have been made part of the suit."
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,425.473,429.459,If we had sought to foreclose our tax lien on the joint account--
1984.84-498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,429.459,437.548,"Tell me, how long has this administrative levy procedure been followed by IRS?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,437.548,441.4,"--Since the Revenue Code was enacted, and it was in existence even before the income tax law."
1984.84-498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.4,449.439,"Well, is Bittker wrong when he says as late as 1981 that resort to the administrative levy was rare?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,460.73,473.971,"As I understand it, the IRS has routinely used levies as the primary collection device for many years, because it's always been the most efficient way to collect taxes, particularly when you have a bank."
1984.84-498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,473.971,476.673,You think Bittker's just wrong factually when he said that?
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,476.673,477.856,"Well, I'd hate to say that."
1984.84-498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.125,480.092,That's what he says.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,481.743,483.943,"--If that's what he says, I'd have to say he's--"
1984.84-498,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,483.943,486.028,I know it was true 20 years ago.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,486.028,488.563,"--In any event, now things have changed."
1984.84-498,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,490.415,491.465,"Well, I'm just curious."
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,501.438,510.044,"--Well, Justice Brennan, again, I don't... it has always been my understanding that levies have been since time immemorial the primary collection device."
1984.84-498,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,517.567,520.019,"It gets all messed up, too, doesn't it?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,520.019,522.185,It's like in Philadelphia.
1984.84-498,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,529.14,548.519,"Mr. Shapiro, if I understand your argument, the other two parties who have an interest in this joint account, the mother and sister, would have to bring sort of an action against the United States to recover whatever amounts of the account they own."
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,551.554,554.839,"Well, they have an administrative remedy and a judicial remedy."
1984.84-498,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,558.808,560.041,There is an administrative remedy?
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,560.041,560.593,"Yes, there is."
1984.84-498,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,561.627,562.41,That may be in your brief.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,562.41,564.879,--43(b) of the Code.
1984.84-498,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,571.782,573.5,Which is authorized by statute?
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,573.5,574.3,--By statute.
1984.84-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.768,631.22,Do they have to prove the levy was wrongful?
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,631.22,645.397,"It is our position, and I think most courts have so held, that the plaintiff in a wrongful levy action, like any plaintiff in any civil action, has the burden of showing that the levy was wrongful."
1984.84-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.397,651.199,"And your contention is that this was not a wrongful levy even if they owned the money, isn't that right?"
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,651.199,662.14,"Well, our contention would be that in that action, that if on the face of the account Roy had the power to withdraw all the money and pay it to the IRS--"
1984.84-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,662.14,664.625,Therefore the levy was not wrongful.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,664.625,665.025,--Right.
1984.84-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.025,666.393,Even if they owned the money.
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,666.393,670.095,It would be up to them to prove some facts--
1984.84-498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.095,675.582,"It wouldn't do them any good to prove it, is what I'm trying to suggest, because if the levy is not wrongful they have no remedy against you."
1984.84-498,0,16449,albert_g_lauber,,675.582,682.753,"--No, if they can show that the property was not Roy's property, but rather their property, that would make the levy wrongful."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,1914.25,1917.369,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.84-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.358,1971.004,"Mr. Wynne, do you think if the bank had just gone ahead and paid the check to the IRS when the levy was made, that the bank would have had a defense as against its depositor, the taxpayer, and his wife and mother?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,1971.004,1975.391,I do not have any Arkansas case law or statutory law that protects the bank.
1984.84-498,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1975.391,1978.926,"Well, you have that statute that says the bank is protected."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,1978.926,1982.894,But only from payments made to co-depositors.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.775,2041.749,"What if, as one of the questions put, the taxpayer here had written a check on the account or got a draft from the bank out of the account and paid it to the treasury."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2049.938,2055.592,They wouldn't have any claim under the particular statutes for a wrongful levy of any nature.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.592,2057.894,Would they have any kind of a claim?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2057.894,2081.843,"I don't... of course, I can't speak for the negotiable instruments laws that might be applicable to the check itself, but that is a potential conversion of those funds, and conceivably then the co-depositors could pursue their remedy against both the taxpayer and the IRS."
1984.84-498,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2129.39,2130.606,"Well, just one moment."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2137.162,2141.364,--The National Bank of Commerce was required by statute to honor withdrawals made by him.
1984.84-498,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.364,2144.5,He could have withdrawn the whole thing himself?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2144.5,2145.433,"Yes, he could."
1984.84-498,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2145.433,2151.487,"At any time, and that rule of the law, either way it was the same?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2154.606,2155.956,That's right.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.176,2165.478,"You'd honor it from any one of the three, would you not?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2165.478,2166.414,That's correct.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2166.414,2171.216,They have each absolute control over the total?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2171.216,2173.901,Vis a vis the bank.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.901,2177.785,How about each other?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2177.785,2185.975,"To the extent of being able to withdraw all the moneys from the account, each of them did have that power to make the withdrawal request."
1984.84-498,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2192.295,2193.831,It's the first one that gets there would get it.
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2193.831,2195.431,The first one that got there would get it.
1984.84-498,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2195.431,2198.399,And the other two had no rights after that?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2198.399,2212.943,"They would have the rights to conversion and their ownership rights under Arkansas law, but they would not have any action against the bank because the statute authorizes the bank to make the payments and protects the bank if it does."
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2242.026,2243.378,"Mr. Wynne, maybe I missed something."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2247.663,2260.987,"Reading that from black versus black, by the Arkansas Supreme Court, in which the court specifically said that these statutes invest no title, but were passed to protect the bank honoring the withdrawal request from the one co-depositor."
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2260.987,2263.805,Couldn't they have been passed for the convenience of the depositors?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2263.805,2267.409,They could have been passed for that reason.
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2273.98,2278.115,Is that statement exclusive or inclusive?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2278.115,2291.692,"I think it's exclusive of the question of whether the joint statute, joint account statute, created any title or ownership, as it specifically excludes title or ownership."
1984.84-498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.003,2467.038,"Mr. Wynne, could I ask you a factual question."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2482.298,2488.802,"--Our bank is a relatively small bank, but since 1959 we've taken this posture."
1984.84-498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.894,2508.346,And the bank has always taken the position that they won't honor a levy like this?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2508.346,2510.546,That's correct.
1984.84-498,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2570.234,2582.292,"Well, in effect you're saying that the administrative levy proceeding just won't be allowed in this situation, because a levy I suppose always acts ex parte, until you can have a hearing at any rate?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2582.292,2585.493,"That's right, the levy procedure is just not... it's ill suited for this."
1984.84-498,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2595.282,2599.42,Has your bank been involved with many 7403 proceedings?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2599.42,2600.553,"--Never had one, Your Honor."
1984.84-498,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2600.553,2601.32,Never had one.
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2602.372,2604.772,Do I know of any that have occurred?
1984.84-498,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.772,2605.49,Yes.
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2605.49,2606.307,Anywhere?
1984.84-498,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2606.307,2606.974,Yes.
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2606.974,2611.442,Tyson versus U.S. as I understand it was a 7403.
1984.84-498,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2611.442,2618.58,I can't imagine why the Government would ever resort to 7403 if they're right about the availability of the administrative levy.
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2619.465,2620.432,It is.
1984.84-498,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2642.045,2645.849,"I take it the bank would have to be a party to a 7403, would it not?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2645.849,2647.182,I believe so.
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2647.182,2658.84,"Mr. Wynne, with all this in the background, why does your bank indulge in or permit joint accounts at all?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2658.84,2669.63,"Well, they call themselves a full service bank, and we have requests from our depositors and we're making the services available."
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2669.63,2671.164,Because your competition does?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2671.164,2671.916,Competition.
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2676.218,2681.022,"Because the customers want it, really?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2681.022,2682.938,"That's right, that's right."
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2710.624,2724.699,"But if a check came along signed by Roy, is it, not for taxes but just drawing everything, your bank would pay it out without any question as to whether Neva or Ruby owned it?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2724.699,2725.134,That's correct.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2729.753,2732.955,Would it be any different if it was a check payable to the IRS?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2732.955,2734.638,It'd make none at all.
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2745.596,2751.182,But you draw the distinction between what the Chief Justice has just indicated and the levy?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2751.182,2752.116,I do.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.715,2816.039,"If you had honored this check, your bank had honored this check, would the other two non-taxpayers have any action under Arkansas law against the bank?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2816.039,2821.61,We feel that they would because it would be a breach of the contractual agreement between depositors and the bank.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2822.962,2827.164,I thought you said earlier that you'd honor any check that came through.
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2827.164,2830.532,"--Well, I misunderstood your question, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2830.532,2842.69,"My question now is, having... as you've said a few minutes ago, the bank had honored a check payable to IRS for exactly the same dollar amounts as are involved here."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2852.213,2852.832,No.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2856.766,2861.67,Because each of the three had authorized every one of the three to do precisely that.
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2861.67,2865.622,--That's correct.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2875.711,2883.184,"Well, you know that they authorized the bank to honor any check that any one of them signed, do you not?"
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2883.184,2888.905,"--Well, we simply know that he is named on this joint account, and the statute allows the bank to recognize those."
1984.84-498,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2894.159,2913.103,"But your point, I gather, is that Arkansas bank law obligates the bank to honor any check drawn by a depositor on the account, but there's no obligation under Arkansas law to pay anything out on the basis of an administrative levy to the IRS because it's not a depositor on the account."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2913.103,2918.007,"That's exactly right, that's exactly right."
1984.84-498,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2925.661,2933.867,Does the record contain the agreement of deposit?
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2939.069,2941.204,It does not.
1984.84-498,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2942.889,2945.675,"No, your time has expired, I guess."
1984.84-498,1,43431,terry_f_wynne,,2945.675,2946.691,"Thank you, gentlemen."
