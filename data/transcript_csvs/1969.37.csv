1969.37,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.91,"Number 37, Hadley against the Junior College District."
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,24.924,27.985,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,266.114,277.936,"Mr. Achtenberg who takes the lead in the formation of the coalition of these school districts in order to form a junior college district, how does that work?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,277.936,287.874,"Well, I suppose Mr. Justice that it occurs at most citizen action occurs, I suppose groups get together and talk to their legislators or --"
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,287.874,288.161,The legislators don't have anything to do with it.
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,288.161,291.389,-- or rather in this case a petition --
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,291.389,297.353,"The legislators as I understand it don't have anything to do with it, would it now that they have passed this authorizing law, isn't it correct?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,297.353,298.415,"That's correct, yes sir."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.535,309.21,"Petition of a certain X percentage of all the people that put up -- put the issue on the ballot, is that it?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,309.21,311.407,"That's correct, yes sir."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.407,323.909,But who is it who selects the -- that the proposed schools that they -- proposed junior college district shall be these seven counties for example.
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,358.368,389.674,"The statute provides and I'll read it whenever a petition is signed by voters in each component school district within a proposed junior college district equal number to 5% of the number of votes cast for the direct to receiving the greatest number of votes within each component school district at the last proceeding school action, in each school district at which a director was elected is presented to the State Board of Education praying the junior college district be organized for the purpose of offering junior college, 13th and 14th year courses."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,406.337,410.95,The legislature does not impose any limitation upon how many school district shall coalesce to form a (Voice Overlap) --
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,410.95,412.345,It does not sir.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.345,415.013,And nor any minimum number --
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,415.013,415.429,That's correct.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,415.429,416.201,Is that correct?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,416.201,416.872,Yes sir.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,416.872,441.609,"And so as a matter of voluntarily getting the other of a number of school districts in order to form a junior college district with the 5% of the vote in each school district and the -- somebody obviously has to take the leadership in proposing the size and contours of the proposed junior college district and as I understand the statute, it doesn't provide who shall take the leadership, this is citizen leadership."
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,441.609,446.75,It would be simply citizen action by voluntary citizen's groups --
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.75,447.125,Right.
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,447.125,453.907,-- who simply get together and decide that it would be an advantage to the community to have a state junior college district (Voice Overlap) --
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,453.907,468.747,"Do a community made up of several school districts and I suppose as an incentive, I suppose typically, if this one is typical, it's a core metropolitan school district plus some satellite rural or village school district --"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,468.747,469.166,"That's correct,"
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.166,469.433,-- isn't that it?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,469.433,470.526,Yes sir.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.526,481.287,And I suppose there has to be some incentive to the rural or village satellite districts to join this core area in order to form a junior college district.
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,481.287,484.744,"Well, that's the assumption which I think is made in the appellee's brief, we deny it."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,484.744,489.997,"Well, I was wondering if it is an assumption or if it is a reality that was the purpose of my questions."
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,489.997,505.35,I think it is equally arguable that the advantages of the district or is advantageous to all the members who come in that they should come in on an equal basis.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,529.978,538.81,"Well, that's what they were told by the legislature, they set up this system in fact if to use your phrase, weighted vote."
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,538.81,540.958,"Well, the statute certainly does provide a weighted vote."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,540.958,546.798,And it was against that background that the -- this junior college district was created.
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,546.798,569.268,"Well, I can only say that I know of no factual history background to support this and I would argue that if there is such a background, it is no more constitutionally permissible then perhaps the historical development of the one legislator per county which this Court struck down in Reynolds versus Sims."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.268,574.9,"How new is this legislation, this authorizing legislation, junior college district?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,574.9,576.499,About six years.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,581.488,586.299,"Thank you, I'm sorry to take this much of your time."
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,586.299,607.296,"Then having formed the college district, we are now concerned with the statutory provision by which the trustees are elected and that is by uniquely Missouri formula which deals not with population but what is quote in Missouri statutes, school enumeration."
1969.37,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,837.988,843.305,How would you give them what they deserve?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,843.305,856.925,"Well, we point out to the Court that under the statute if the court invalidates simply the sub-district or component district formula, the trustees under the remaining portion of the statute may be elected at large."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,856.925,860.446,"That would mean that Kansas City would have all of them, wouldn't it?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,860.446,863.078,That has not been historically true.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,980.302,983.996,"This is population, not school enumeration?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,986.519,999.286,"Well, for purposes of our discussion and throughout this case, we have considered that school enumeration being a segment of the population is proportionate to population."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,999.908,1005.523,Is it in fact -- it isn't like that registered voter situation we had in --
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1005.523,1006.374,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1006.374,1009.838,Is that like the registered voter situation we had in the (Inaudible) case?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1009.838,1011.082,I would say so.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.082,1011.856,It is?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1011.856,1023.006,The statistics have not been assembled in an -- any encyclopedic way but basically the six to 20 population would tend to follow the general population.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.006,1031.686,I think we said in Burns that the registered voters might be a permissible base provided it was the substantial equivalent of a general population base.
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1031.686,1032.257,That's correct.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1032.257,1036.39,And you're suggesting that could apply here using a school enumeration base?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1036.39,1037.653,We do sir.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.536,1348.2,By what -- by virtue of what provision of the constitution?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1348.2,1350.507,The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1350.507,1354.078,"Then it had nothing to do with the Sanders case, doesn't it?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1354.078,1354.582,I'm sorry sir.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1354.582,1358.392,"That clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had nothing to do with the Wesberry case, do it?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1358.392,1376.473,The Wesberry was versed on -- was based on Article 1 but it seems that -- seems to me that whether we're relying on that provision of the constitution of the Fourteenth Amendment that the constitutional concept of the voter's rights and the equality of voter's rights is the same.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.473,1379.305,That was the reason for my question.
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1392.965,1411.172,I would say so although this Court has seem to place the Congressional districting on Article 1 and the legislative districting and county districting on the Fourteenth Amendment seems to me that the underlying democratic constitutional principle is the same.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1411.172,1416.994,"Well, I just want to -- where did you find that underlying concept in the constitution?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1416.994,1419.943,In both of those clauses.
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1432.554,1448.752,"Would you mind telling me of -- I guess it doesn't, but the record shows anywhere what's really the cause of this fight?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1448.752,1454.045,"Well, that requires me to express my opinion."
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1454.41,1457.584,I said if the record shows it all and the --
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1457.584,1475.229,"Well, the -- I think I can answer it this way on the record, this suit was brought by voters in the central city district or the Kansas City School District portion of the junior college district in two counts."
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1500.783,1502.479,That isn't -- city in the suburb?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1502.479,1509.571,"I would say so, yes sir and the existing conflict which confronts our school systems today."
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1509.571,1515.936,Is Missouri elect all of its school trustees?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1515.936,1517.054,Yes sir.
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1517.054,1518.402,College and --
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1518.402,1518.469,Sir?
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1518.469,1520.126,-- High school?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1520.126,1520.723,"I'm sorry, I didn't --"
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1520.723,1522.259,College and high school?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1522.259,1523.161,"Well, no."
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1552.516,1553.535,How are they selected?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1553.535,1556.154,Appointment by the Governor.
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1556.154,1564.976,"I presume the Governor could appoint, the law could provide for the Governor to appoint these trustees?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1564.976,1578.041,"Well, Mr. Justice you asked me a question which I think is not encompassed within the issues in this case and again its my opinion and I don't think this Court has yet faced that question."
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1629.769,1634.61,"I'm not talking about desirable, its constitutional."
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1634.61,1636.115,I don't know.
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1638.646,1640.717,Did anybody challenge such a law --?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1640.717,1641.492,Sir?
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1641.492,1650.793,Did anybody challenge such a law in any of these states as providing that the Governor can appoint trustees?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1650.793,1664.623,"Well, certainly in the Sailors case, this Court said that by its decision that the -- in a different type of a school district, a County Board of Education that the appointive process was acceptable."
1969.37,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1739.68,1745.591,"A great many important Government functions are performed by non-elected officials, are they not?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1745.591,1748.02,Yes sir.
1969.37,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1754.709,1769.595,"And when these functions are preformed by such a point of officials, you cannot get the prefect distribution that you are -- not necessarily that you are aiming for but is involved in a district by district selection."
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1769.595,1769.812,"Yes sir, you're correct."
1969.37,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1769.812,1770.964,Is that not true?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1770.964,1780.637,It is true.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1936.49,1938.355,Could I ask you just a moment.
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1938.355,1941.165,I'm sorry.
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1941.165,1953.907,Are the policies of the local school district's circumscribed by the policies announced by State Board of Education?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1956.942,1965.755,"Well, to some side it extends but basically the school boards are autonomous."
1969.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1978.138,1980.604,What about curriculum?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1980.604,1985.407,Curriculum is the decision of the trustees.
1969.37,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.407,1988.48,And the qualifications of teachers?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1988.48,1989.88,The same.
1969.37,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.88,1994.851,The state board doesn't prescribe the curriculum and qualification?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1994.851,2013.276,"Well, as my understanding that the State Board of Education is in a sense advisory, our state laws give great power to the local school boards except for the familiar exception of arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of power."
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2036.179,2047.233,"Did I understand you to say sometime ago and reading over the list of powers of these trustees, they have the power to levy taxes?"
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,2047.233,2051.282,As subject to a vote or approval.
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2051.282,2052.831,Subject to what approval?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,2052.831,2052.879,Vote or approve.
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2052.879,2053.779,Vote or approval?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,2053.779,2055.098,Yes sir.
1969.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2055.098,2056.456,They have to submit it to the voter?
1969.37,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,2056.456,2066.652,"That's correct, yes sir."
1969.37,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2066.652,2067.829,Mr. Burrell.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2067.829,2073.597,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2153.23,2160.632,You mean by that Mr. Burrell that the state board could retail the construction of the junior college district --
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2160.632,2162.316,Mr. Justice Brennan that is correct.
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2162.316,2163.553,I see.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2163.553,2165.402,Either board could veto it.
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.402,2167.191,Has the board given any standards?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2167.191,2167.607,Yes.
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2220.59,2223.853,"There need not be a majority in each component school district, am I right?"
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2223.853,2225.604,That is correct.
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2269.687,2272.852,Was all this legislation passed together about six years ago?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2272.852,2277.057,It was all passed substantially in 1961.
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.057,2279.996,Before that you didn't -- did you have any provision for junior colleges?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2279.996,2288.638,Before that the individual component school districts could have their own junior college just like they have their own high school.
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2288.638,2290.456,As to one district junior college?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2290.456,2291.13,That's correct.
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.13,2292.069,One school district junior.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2292.069,2304.118,"And at that time and it is of, I think considerable importance, there were seven such junior colleges in Missouri where the total number of students of what -- of somewhat over 5,000."
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2304.118,2332.223,My question -- my question was directed to the inquiry of whether or not its of any significance that this whole creation of this junior college district with by a majority referendum was against the background of this very legislative provision for your representation that's now being attack whether or not it was in other words of action and reliance so to speak.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2336.18,2338.234,I'm not sure that I understand the question but I think --
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2338.234,2339.828,I'm not sure I do either but I'm just --
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2339.828,2347.551,If the law was passed in order to foster and encourage the development of the junior college system.
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2347.551,2353.266,By encouraging several school districts to get together to form a junior college district.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2353.266,2354.183,That is correct.
1969.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2354.183,2362.558,"And the -- those that did get together who had did so against their understanding that they would be represented, on that board, that was my question."
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2362.558,2364.108,That is correct.
1969.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2399.842,2406.93,It's probably not material here but as the curriculum compared with the curriculum of your state university?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2406.93,2435.475,"I will say this that the -- and I this were to answer in part the question of Mr. Justice White, the curriculum is uniform curriculum of -- for all the junior colleges is controlled by the state board of education with the view that the -- by a statute, they must consider the admission requirements of the University of Missouri."
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2469.517,2473.45,"Mr. Burrell, who determines the location of the junior college."
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2473.45,2475.982,That is determined by the board of trustees.
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2475.982,2480.736,And is that subject to a veto of any state board?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2480.736,2481.771,"No, it is not."
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2481.771,2487.562,And who determines how much it's going to cost?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2487.562,2493.407,"Well, with respect to getting the money to build the building and require the land."
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2493.407,2493.733,Yes.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2493.733,2501.128,That would have to be normally done by a bond issue which would be voted upon by the people.
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2501.128,2511.264,"But the design of the buildings and the amount going to be spent in their construction and all that, is that all determined by the board of trustees?"
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2511.264,2514.012,Subject to getting the money by the bond approval.
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2514.012,2516.28,But that's a bond approved by the voters?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2516.28,2517.301,That is correct.
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2519.826,2531.305,And did I understand Mr. Achtenberg to say that the real basis of the dispute here was among trustees whether the location should be in the suburbs from the central city.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2531.305,2535.399,I think that that is the way as -- it was -- it conceivably started.
1969.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2543.894,2546.347,What's the term of office of the trustee?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2546.347,2549.476,The term of office is six years.
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2555.542,2561.001,"How about the current expenses, current running expenses?"
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2561.001,2581.958,By -- when the voters vote to organize the district they specifically authorize a levy in our district of up to ten cents for a hundred dollar evaluation in our district by the board of trustees without voter approval.
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2581.958,2586.721,"Well, what's the difference between that and the regular school district?"
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2586.721,2592.41,"Well, there's quite a little difference -- there's quite a little difference in amount for example --"
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2592.41,2597.276,"No, I mean as to how it's done."
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2597.276,2603.488,I don't think that basically there is any general difference there.
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2612.075,2615.556,But they all vote -- that's all into one package they agreed on.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2615.556,2617.904,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.748,2631.328,"Well, essentially what's the difference between that and the City of Kansas City school boards as to their authority, their money, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2631.328,2637.255,"Well, the Kansas City School Board I believe is -- this is correct, it can go up to three dollars and 75 cents for a hundred dollar (Voice Overlap) --"
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2637.255,2639.768,"So I mean, how the members pay it or the Kansas City Board --"
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2639.768,2650.212,How would the members pay -- there is a new law which just went into effect in January with the Kansas City School Board an I'm not certain about the exact provisions of it.
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2650.212,2654.092,"What about the old ones, were they elected or appointed?"
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2654.092,2673.351,"Under the old law, if I'm not mistaken, we had two political parties select half of the board and each political party and then they were all voted on and this by -- some understanding there was never any opposition if my recollection is correct."
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2673.351,2684.679,"Well, the trustee board here is performing an essential governmental function, its governing, it use the authority of the state, no question about any of that."
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2684.679,2689.858,"Well, I would -- there is no question that it is an instrumentality of the state."
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2700.194,2709.135,"Well, is there any fundamental difference between the school board that operates a two year college and the school board that operates eight year."
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2710.356,2724.086,There's no fundamental difference except in degree and I suppose junior college has less impact on the entire area than the elementary and the high schools do.
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.086,2727.582,But it's the same type of function?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2727.582,2729.74,"Or its education, its education."
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.74,2731.55,The same type of function as any other function?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2731.55,2733.345,"It's same type of function, that's correct."
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2733.345,2741.488,I am -- I mean I'm not trying to -- I was just trying to get in into perspective as to a regular school board.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2746.337,2747.254,That is correct.
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2747.254,2750.142,And they were operated by whom?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2750.142,2754.809,They were operated by the various component by -- component school districts?
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2754.809,2759.05,Like a county board and a city board or were they junior college board?
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2759.05,2767.699,"No, they were what we would call -- most of it are what we call a six member board, local school districts --"
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2767.699,2770.185,That's what I mean but they wouldn't be just for the junior college.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2770.185,2770.844,No.
1969.37,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.135,2779.825,Thank you.
1969.37,1,43866,william_j_burrell,,2779.825,2802.973,"I might say here that the -- we have six trustees and the allocation is on the basis of school enumeration which has been as suggested to you, the number of persons in the component school district between the ages of six and twenty."
1969.37,2,34341,louis_c_defeo_jr,,3772.009,3774.602,I will never -- to be as brief as possible.
1969.37,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3815.241,3823.508,"If they were elected at large, they are -- the first to be all was the risk that they'd all be elected from one end of the areas, is it not possible?"
1969.37,2,34341,louis_c_defeo_jr,,3823.508,3845.956,"Yes and in particular this question was brought out earlier and the counsel for the appellant said that there were a slight chance of this happening in fact but I know in Kansas City public school district, where directors were formerly elected at large that it is either four of the six or five of the six who come from the same high school attendants area."
1969.37,3,28475,irving_achtenberg,,4488.295,4492.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
