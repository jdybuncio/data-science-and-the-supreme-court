1991.90-5844,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.247,"We'll hear argument now on No. 90-5844, Terry Foucha v. Louisiana."
1991.90-5844,0,31917,james_p_manasseh,,11.36,15.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-5844,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.481,159.545,"In Jones, the Court was dealing with a statute, was it not, that required both of those findings?"
1991.90-5844,0,31917,james_p_manasseh,,159.545,163.307,"Your Honor, it did deal with a statute that required both of those findings."
1991.90-5844,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.136,181.831,Do you think Jones supports your position or is simply neutral?
1991.90-5844,0,31917,james_p_manasseh,,181.831,192.857,"Your Honor, I think that Jones supports our condition because Jones specifically says that the Constitution... and the Louisiana supreme court ignored the reference to the Constitution in that particular holding."
1991.90-5844,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.619,201.612,"But in Jones, the Court was dealing with a statute that required both of those."
1991.90-5844,0,31917,james_p_manasseh,,203.934,205.245,--Yes.
1991.90-5844,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.245,215.153,"It doesn't necessarily follow, I would think, the statute which required less from the State than the Jones statute is unconstitutional."
1991.90-5844,0,31917,james_p_manasseh,,215.153,249.865,"Your Honor, I would suggest that the statute, the reasoning in Jones specifically said... and I'm not here to tell the Court what the Court meant in Jones... but if the nature and the duration of confinement must be reasonably related to the purpose of initial confinement, and his initial confinement is based upon the fact that he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and therefore, his confinement must continue because he is continuing to be mentally ill and dangerous, once he establishes that he is no longer dangerous... excuse me."
1991.90-5844,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,261.041,283.595,"Mr. Manasseh, what about a statute like in the State of Washington that, for someone who is acquitted in a criminal case as not guilty by reason of insanity and is then committed to a mental institution for a specific term of years that might, for example, be related to some equivalent penalty for the offense."
1991.90-5844,0,31917,james_p_manasseh,,293.503,310.132,"Your Honor, I believe that there can be certain circumstances, if a statute is narrowly tailored and specifically defined such as the situation of a regulatory detention, that the State could have interests that outweigh the individual's liberty interest."
1991.90-5844,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.132,315.876,"Well, do you concede that a statutory scheme such as Washington State's is valid?"
1991.90-5844,0,31917,james_p_manasseh,,315.876,318.27,Do I concede that it is valid?
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1752.556,1760.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-5844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.878,1802.819,"We don't know that this defendant is dangerous, though."
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1803.88,1804.591,"Well, I--"
1991.90-5844,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.591,1810.943,"We just don't have a psychiatrist who's willing to come in and say, you know, he's not dangerous."
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1814.027,1816.747,"--I beg to differ with you on this point, Justice Scalia."
1991.90-5844,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1857.035,1859.597,How do you really prove dangerousness?
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1861.127,1864.319,It's inexact.
1991.90-5844,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.319,1865.18,It's what?
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1865.18,1868.633,"It's an inexact science, just as psychiatry is inexact."
1991.90-5844,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1868.633,1881.473,"Well, not very long ago, the American Medical Association issued a paper saying that the prognosis of future dangerousness is wrong more times than it is correct."
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1883.402,1887.493,"Not in terms of this petitioner, Mr. Foucha."
1991.90-5844,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1887.493,1890.455,It has been cited in an opinion in this Court.
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1890.455,1902.233,It does not... it does not bother me because I still feel that the State has a legitimate overwhelming interest in protecting the community from individuals such as Mr. Foucha who remain dangerous.
1991.90-5844,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1902.233,1911.392,"Well, I think it is true that medical opinion often says that a murderer, incarcerated, will never commit another crime."
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1922.148,1936.296,"Well, some people... people may hold that view, but I feel that in this particular case, and in other cases as well, it must be looked at on a case-by-case basis based on what the individual has done."
1991.90-5844,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.117,1957.271,"No, but is it not fair to infer that the reason he did it was that he was mentally unbalanced at the time of the act?"
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1959.953,1964.455,"Well, then, again, you come back to the inexact science of psychiatry."
1991.90-5844,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.556,1983.387,"Well, if it's an inexact science, then what you're saying is that as long as one is unclear, and we don't know whether the person is dangerous or not, which is probably true of most individuals, then the individual cannot sustain the burden of proving beyond... by a preponderance of the evidence that he's not dangerous."
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1983.387,1984.158,"--Well, he can't--"
1991.90-5844,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.158,1990.302,"So the uncertain... in all uncertain cases, the person must remain incarcerated forever."
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,1990.302,1992.153,"--No, that's not what I'm saying."
1991.90-5844,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.028,2009.433,"Yes, but if psychiatrists are all uncertain, because of his past history, and are unwilling to say, I certify this man is no longer dangerous, then he loses, doesn't he?"
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,2009.433,2013.747,"No, because, you see, dangerousness is not a medical determination."
1991.90-5844,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.587,2025.485,"Well, but, what is there in judicial history that determines dangerousness from some source other than prior criminal acts on the one hand or mental disease on the other?"
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,2031.5,2041.585,"Well, not necessarily unrelated to wrongdoing, but in Mr. Foucha's case, he was diagnosed as having an antisocial personality disorder, which Dr. Ritter indicated cannot be cured."
1991.90-5844,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.947,2047.919,But then... but you say... then would you not win on the ground that he is still mentally ill?
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,2051.431,2057.496,"--This appears to be the case, from what I can ascertain from Dr. Ritter's testimony."
1991.90-5844,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.496,2069.112,"Do you think he could... if you think he's got a personality disorder unrelated to mental illness, but nevertheless makes him dangerous, could you commit him if he had... never been found not guilty by reason of insanity?"
1991.90-5844,1,38163,pamela_s_moran,,2077.348,2079.4,"No, not... not civilly."
1991.90-5844,2,31917,james_p_manasseh,,3159.029,3161.52,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-5844,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3182.804,3185.125,Your opponent says it would have 30 years.
1991.90-5844,2,31917,james_p_manasseh,,3185.125,3186.517,"--Your Honor, it was a first offense."
1991.90-5844,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.059,3205.122,"Thank you, Mr. Manasseh."
