1977.76-1184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,67.226,We will hear arguments next in Malone against White Motor Corporation.
1977.76-1184,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,73.813,75.535,Mr. Allyn is just fine Your Honor.
1977.76-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.701,195.657,Well you would not be making that argument if the federal law had clearly said that the states could not pass this certain law.
1977.76-1184,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,195.657,196.735,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1977.76-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.735,205.163,So you are not challenging the constitutionality in any substantive due process?
1977.76-1184,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,205.163,212.086,"Those issues are not here today, question to due process, contract clause and so on and so forth, are still down below, Your Honor."
1977.76-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.04,343.831,Do you think constitutional right to travel extends to corporations or just the persons?
1977.76-1184,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,343.831,346.869,I am speechless and cannot answer that.
1977.76-1184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,417.55,423.276,Did the employersâ€™ contributions meet the requirements of the Collective Bargaining Contract?
1977.76-1184,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,423.276,430.658,"Your Honor, there is nothing in the Collective Bargaining Contract that I know of that specifically tells them how much to put in."
1977.76-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,450.978,460.261,Would an employee have had an individual contract right against White for failure to comply with the promise contained in the pension plan?
1977.76-1184,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,460.261,467.31,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we believe that it is possible that they might, no employee has commenced such an action."
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1302.094,1305.281,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1977.76-1184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1360.98,1363.022,"Well, you think your state did forbid a pension plan."
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1363.022,1366.331,"I do not think that, Mr. Justice White, because --"
1977.76-1184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.331,1373.58,And provide a pension plan unless it provides for no cancellation?
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1373.58,1378.973,It could in effect provide that any pension plan written in this state must have a Termination Insurance Program.
1977.76-1184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1380.783,1391.695,Could it provide that any pension plan in the state must provide at least 60% of the wages earned in the last three years of employment?
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1391.695,1396.104,I think it could under the scheme.
1977.76-1184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1396.104,1401.176,Not withstanding a prior agreement?
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1401.176,1403.408,"Well, yes."
1977.76-1184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1403.408,1406.304,I am speaking of an Act passed now.
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1413.165,1418.398,I think the retroactivity question of the Minnesota Legislation is not before the court now.
1977.76-1184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1419.727,1421.485,"It is pretty retroactive, is it not?"
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1421.485,1435.109,"It is retroactive indeed but I think that the question of whether Minnesota can pass the statute and impose its terms on the parties is not before this court except for the preemption, the Supremacy Clause Argument."
1977.76-1184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.109,1441.245,And this is even though pension payments might be a whole part of wages?
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1441.245,1457.013,"Well, in an industrial sense, yes they might be called the part of wages but that is to say no more than if Congress sets a minimum wage of two dollars and says the states can go higher then Minnesota could certainly say the minimum wage in this state is three dollars and it could require the parties to start with three dollars."
1977.76-1184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.013,1459.121,And why is that?
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1459.121,1465.346,"Because Congress has said in, I believe, it is the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress has said the states can go higher."
1977.76-1184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.862,1482.822,"Well, it said that but you are just saying that means almost everything including termination dates, level obtainments."
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1482.822,1487.584,"Well, it includes everything that Congress had in mind when it said states may regulate pension plans."
1977.76-1184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.9,1524.939,"At least do you think, your submission is at least it is very clear that there are some things the state can do that the parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement can agree not to do."
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1524.939,1525.82,Cannot set aside?
1977.76-1184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.82,1526.141,Yes.
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1526.141,1526.656,That is correct.
1977.76-1184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.656,1527.668,"There are some things, anyway."
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1527.668,1529.034,There are some things.
1977.76-1184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1529.034,1538.579,Would this be one example that the State Law would require that no official in the union be a trustee of the pension fund?
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1546.209,1555.814,"I believe before ERISA that would be a permissible state regulation because I believe the Disclosure Act does not address that, therefore it is one those thing that Congress left to the states."
1977.76-1184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1555.814,1560.044,"That would be regulation without any substantive change, however, would it not?"
1977.76-1184,1,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1560.044,1562.024,It would be.
1977.76-1184,2,24038,frank_c_heath,,2310.267,2315.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1977.76-1184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2828.413,2859.15,"What if under other Collective Bargaining Agreement there had been extensive provisions in assuming the company is engaged in the business of coal mining, extensive provisions for maintaining the safety of the mine that had been agreed to in the process of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in 1971, and three years later, the state of Minnesota enacts a provision that is much more stringent and that provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, would that in you view be preempted?"
1977.76-1184,2,24038,frank_c_heath,,2859.15,2871.63,"That depends on how this court interprets what is called as Local Interest Exception, and the safety and health provisions set forth in Oliver."
