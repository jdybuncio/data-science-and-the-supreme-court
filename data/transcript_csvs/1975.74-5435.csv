1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.197,"We will hear arguments next in 74-5435, Imbler against Pachtman."
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,49.732,52.522,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.7,117.965,"We also have opinions going the other way, do we not, from the Supreme Court of California?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,117.965,133.116,I am glad you asked that question Mr. Justice Rehnquist because in fact the opinions of the California Supreme Court did not address themselves as thoroughly as opinion of U.S. District Judge Warren Ferguson in Los Angeles.
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.389,159.631,"Well, nonetheless you know you can weigh the opinions the way you want, but what you have is seven justices of the Supreme Court unanimously finding against your client on this point."
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,166.09,173.865,Plus petition was made by the State of California to this Court to have that reviewed and it was nine to nothing against voting any hearing.
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.865,175.799,"Well, how do you know that?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,175.799,177.528,I know that because I opposed it.
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.171,183.005,"Well, how do you know what the vote was in our conference?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,183.005,187.901,"Well, there was no votes that suggested certiorari be granted."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.901,189.026,"Well, is that the test?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,191.714,199.375,"Well, I know that some of the denials of certiorari are accompanied by Mr. Justice X and Mr. Justice Y would grant certiorari in this case."
1975.74-5435,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.381,273.475,"Mr. Hanson, excuse me Chief Justice."
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,289.92,290.768,I understand.
1975.74-5435,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,290.768,311.302,"And I know that you took a back up position that even though there might be immunity in the normal situation, at least there should be an exemption when a Federal Court has found that there are correct and that there was a knowing used of perjured testimony, but the first and basic question is the immunity of the prosecutor, quite a part from the merits of this case, is that not correct?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,311.302,311.907,That is correct.
1975.74-5435,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.804,315.102,That is what I thought.
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,315.102,331.989,"Now, as to that particular situation, there is no question that the national ballot, if you count up all the cases that have gone one way versus the other way, overwhelmingly is against the petitioner in this particular case, just without question."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.022,418.814,Would it not just good faith be pretty much a question for the jury in every case --
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,418.814,418.836,Well --
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.836,422.182,"-- under review, subjective state of mind?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,422.182,423.332,That is very possible.
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.157,435.888,So that you would have a jury issue under your view of what should be the rule in almost every case?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,435.888,441.381,"Well, I do not believe in almost every case, certainly not in this case, certainly not in this case, that is before the Court now."
1975.74-5435,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,465.506,475.976,"(Inaudible) In this case, you have a finding by a court, a competent court, in writ of habeas corpus."
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,481.006,489.388,"Well, I do not necessarily want to, but I am addressing myself to Mr. Justice Stewart who said the broad question should be considered first."
1975.74-5435,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.065,506.383,But your point I assume is that where there has been a finding in a court on a habeas corpus that the conduct was thus and so that at least entitles you to a hearing?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,506.383,507.761,"Yes, no question."
1975.74-5435,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,509.372,511.661,I just want to be sure you are not abandoning that?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,511.661,513.322,Oh! No! Not at all.
1975.74-5435,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,546.791,553.73,"And he also said that even if the actual malicious immunity was there, you do not want to adapt that, do you?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,553.73,554.607,"He did say that, that is correct."
1975.74-5435,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,554.607,555.782,He sure did.
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.782,560.354,I should think that is the last quotation you would want to make in support of your cause?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,560.354,573.989,"Well, I say that our case comes within that canopy because we have come as close as we could to the situation with the grant of the federal writ of habeas corpus because of that particular issue."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,577.913,579.949,He has had his preliminary hearing where?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,579.949,587.514,"He said his preliminary hearing by virtue of this 22 U.S.C. or 28 U.S.C. 2254, grant of writ of habeas corpus?"
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.514,591.832,"Well, why is the respondent bound by that proceeding? He was not a party to it, was he?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,591.832,596.435,"Well no, but the record is there Mr. Justice Rehnquist and he admitted."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,602.953,608.897,"You may use this testimony against him then I presume, but if he is not a party, I would think he would not be bound?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,608.897,611.245,"Well, the U.S. Ninth Circuit said he was not bound."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.881,662.48,But the District Judge has been reversed no less than three times by this Court since I have been a member of it?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,662.48,662.869,I do not know.
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,739.91,746.68,Do I recall correctly that this case came before the California Supreme Court twice?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,746.68,747.915,In fact three times.
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,747.915,748.867,Three times?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,748.867,755.78,"The first time, it was on the automatic appeal which is provided under our penal code because a dissent was imposed."
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,762.142,772.679,But was it not -- was it treated to in any degree at all in the final disposition by the California Supreme Court?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,772.679,784.431,The second opinion Mr. Chief Justice at 60 Cal. 2d 554 was disclosed as a California Supreme Court came to treating it and it again ignored many of the issues.
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,784.431,786.663,Did Justice Traynor write both of the opinions?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,786.663,788.154,"He did, the first two opinions."
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,788.154,788.381,The first two --
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,788.381,790.006,I think he wrote all three opinions.
1975.74-5435,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,837.939,841.409,"What are you asking for here only damages, any other kind of relief?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,841.409,849.248,"Only monetary damages, that is correct and in the District Court lawsuit that is correct."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.956,899.048,But is it not good faith almost always a question for the jury?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,899.048,904.136,"Well, certainly it is probably always a question for the jury."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.136,909.199,"But then you would not eliminate any case really by your pre-trial hearing, would you?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,909.199,911.97,"Well, I am mentioning more than that alone."
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1003.134,1037.075,"Well, the case that have decided this issue against the theory that you are arguing have put it on the basis that not of the risk of having a damage verdict, but against the dangers and the risks involved in having a prosecutor spend his time defending the suits instead of carrying out his function of prosecuting cases, is that not the choice that has been made?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1037.075,1040.468,"Well, I understand that that is a language that appears in many of the cases."
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1097.174,1105.819,You then apparently equate prosecutors and all other executive officers as being on the same level?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1105.819,1106.395,I do.
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1140.028,1146.371,Do you think a governor calling up the National Guard is exercising a quasi-judicial function?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1146.371,1168.496,"No, I think he is exercising an executive function as a chief law officer of the state, but to insulate one side to a lawsuit as they are attempting to do with the public prosecutor from review by any type of civil rights action by any type of federal judge, I think elevates him to a position where his decision becomes above the U.S. Constitution."
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1181.004,1184.546,Do you think there might be more of them if you prevail here?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1184.546,1194.822,"No, I do not think so Chief Justice Burger because I think this Court can delineate certain guidelines that have to be followed and I would hope that they would do so in allowing this suit to stand."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1202.246,1206.303,You have mentioned that about three times during your argument Mr. Hanson.
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1223.297,1233.943,"I think that surely, if you could not show that he was behaving outside of a discretionary act, it would be automatically subjected to dismissal, that is one of the issues."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1233.943,1234.823,"Well, okay now."
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1260.597,1266.513,"It is a harder decision obviously than the knowing use of perjured testimony, a harder decision."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.513,1283.289,"Well, but even the knowing use of perjured testimony, you can end up with the finding to that effect on the basis if hindsight, but the question in the eyes of a prosecutor maybe, is this witness lying or is he not?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1292.466,1310.734,"I understand, but in this particular case, he admitted to knowing this, if it pleases the Court, he admitted to knowing the status of this man that he had been committed to an insane asylum by a court and he said at the evidentiary hearing I decided to let the jury attempt to do -- to figure it out themselves."
1975.74-5435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.734,1317.095,And the Supreme Court of California upheld the prosecutor’s position on the basis of that evidentiary hearing?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1317.095,1322.292,"Well, by ignoring that particular thing in its opinion, by ignoring that."
1975.74-5435,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1322.292,1327.879,You mean Chief Justice Traynor ignored what you say is the heart of this case?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1327.879,1328.551,That is correct.
1975.74-5435,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1371.344,1376.831,"If you were not there, how do you know what Judge Traynor had?"
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1381.04,1382.991,"No, I just read the opinion."
1975.74-5435,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1382.991,1389.222,So yours is all based on reading opinion that brought this conclusion that he did not know what he is talking about?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1389.222,1407.675,"No, I have read the briefs and some of these materials were not properly briefed because there are some people that say, well, unless there is actual overt perjury it is different then the Napue versus Illinois situation where he is required to change or to call to the attention of the trier of the fact known false statements."
1975.74-5435,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.28,1416.952,The point is I do not think you need to characterize a judge’s actions in order to win your lawsuit?
1975.74-5435,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,1416.952,1418.214,"Well, that is possible."
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,1880.504,1882.958,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.649,1951.795,So under California Law there is a damage remedy against this prosecutor if you can show he knowingly used perjured testimony?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,1951.795,1954.405,"No, there is not a damage remedy against the prosecutor."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.034,1961.649,Out of state fund?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,1961.649,1962.091,Yes.
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.091,1964.001,"Well, how about suing the prosecutor?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,1964.001,1965.925,"No, under the Tort Claims Act."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.283,1987.536,Are you suggesting that under the California Statutes or the California Common Law that a prosecutor is absolutely immune?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,1987.536,1989.946,He is absolutely immune from malicious prosecution.
1975.74-5435,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2030.321,2035.697,You mean there is an absolute immunity defense available to him under the Tort Claims Act?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2035.697,2038.503,The quasi-judicial immunity under the common law --
1975.74-5435,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2038.503,2041.808,"For this prosecutor it would be an absolute immunity, would it not?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2041.808,2042.008,Right.
1975.74-5435,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2045.078,2045.593,I know it.
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2051.237,2053.898,Because it is absolute under the common law.
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.898,2059.206,Would it be absolute if he is found perjury?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2059.206,2061.289,"Yes, because the --"
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2061.289,2062.534,Because he is a prosecutor?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2062.534,2062.86,Right.
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.86,2065.732,Is there any other reason?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2065.732,2066.397,"Well, yes there is a --"
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2066.397,2067.947,"It is a crime, is that a crime in California?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2067.947,2068.781,It is a crime.
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2070.402,2071.967,Could he be convicted of it?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2071.967,2073.15,"Yes, he could be convicted of it."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2073.15,2075.763,But he could not be liable in civil action?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2075.763,2077.097,Right.
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.097,2080.556,"Now if he is convicted of it, would he then be liable in a civil action?."
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2080.556,2085.966,"No, there is no -- at present, certainly, there is no rule of that kind."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2088.504,2094.81,The only person that can do that in California is upon perjury get away with it is a prosecutor?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2094.81,2097.622,A judge could also do that.
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2097.622,2099.699,Who else?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2100.598,2109.833,"Well, right that would probably a legislator conceivably, if it were a legislative act that would be difficult to imagine."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2109.833,2115.537,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2115.537,2123.205,"Well, the California cases are pretty much along the line of the general national cases."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2157.603,2159.757,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2159.757,2162.527,"Well, the decision to prosecute is like a judge."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.527,2164.495,(Inaudible) even outside the courtroom?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2164.495,2165.617,"Yes, that is taken --"
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.617,2167.872,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2167.872,2172.188,"The decision on what evidence to present weighing the evidence to present, weighing the --"

1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2179.859,2186.637,"Well, there has been Court of Appeal decisions saying that if a public defender for instance who has been sued under Civil Rights Act is quasi --"
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2186.637,2192.265,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2192.265,2193.556,"No, he cannot be sued for it."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.62,2199.988,Why is the so? (Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2199.988,2205.548,"Basically, a private defense counsel could not be sued for what he did in the courtroom."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.126,2233.554,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2233.554,2235.169,"Well, but that is an absolute immunity."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.266,2244.177,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2244.177,2250.882,"Well, I do not think there would be a civil suit for subordination of perjury against the private lawyer, only a government lawyer."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2250.882,2252.153,Why?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2252.153,2261.666,"Well, I cannot think of any private action unless perhaps some intention and put you on motion of the distress."
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.325,2267.413,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2267.413,2271.178,But that would not be malpractice if it be against the opponent.
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2289.164,2291.785,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2291.785,2293.585,And that is a very sufficient remedy I would think.
1975.74-5435,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.585,2299.574,(Inaudible)
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2299.574,2300.974,"No, I would not do it."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.129,2373.974,"What if a prosecutor, you say he is protected if he is suborns perjury, if he bribes the witness to testify in a certain way?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2373.974,2378.945,"Well, no, there may be –- well, first, he is not protected certainly."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.945,2381.248,But he is absolutely immune under 1983?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2381.248,2383.377,"Well, I am not sure if he bribed the person."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.647,2395.508,So you say he is not immune from that?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2395.508,2398.784,"I do not think he would, for the payment of a bribe, I do not think he would be."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.784,2407.062,"Well, now what if he is in the courtroom, what if he is cross-examining the witness and he just loses his temper and he goes and punches the witness in the nose?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2407.062,2409.628,That is not a prosecutorial act.
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.628,2412.398,You mean that is not just within the normal balance of prosecutorial behavior?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2412.398,2414.281,Right.
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.281,2415.639,Is that right or not?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2416.64,2424.015,"No, I am saying it is not the type of action that is typically prima facie disregarding motive."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.509,2438.35,"Alright, now the same prosecutor though, the same prosecutor puts a witness on the stand knowing he is perjuring himself."
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2447.255,2447.884,Right.
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.884,2449.31,Because there is a deprivation of due process?
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2449.31,2450.255,Right.
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.255,2458.257,"Now, is that within the normal bounds of prosecutorial conduct to put on the stand knowing perjured testimony any more than punching the fellow in the nose?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2458.257,2461.29,"No, it is not normal to do an evil thing."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.256,2463.804,"Well, I did not say that is normal."
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2467.667,2482.796,"Well, it is not normal prosecutorial behavior to do something evil and criminal, but the action of asking the question is normal prosecutorial behavior and that is what is the key too, just as in judicial immunity and in legislative immunity."
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.454,2504.393,"If you threaten the witness, you either testify this way or I will prosecute your mother or your brother or somebody, what about that?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2516.219,2520.447,I think he is asking the question in the courtroom definitely.
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.521,2540.978,"Now he brings -- there is lawsuit going afterwards for convicting me from using false testimony, a knowing use of false testimony which was obtained by a threat issued by the prosecutor?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2548.368,2550.616,There may possibly be separable.
1975.74-5435,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.087,2573.6,"Are you suggesting then that we really should divide prosecutorial behavior in the various categories, at least two, some that are really part of the prosecutorial acts and some are not?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2573.6,2579.798,But not by characterization of motive and not by characterization of whether it is true or false.
1975.74-5435,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2594.822,2608.377,"Mr. Farrell, if I understood you to suggest your colloquy of Mr. Justice White that where the prosecutor to bribe a witness to give a certain testimony, he might be subject to a suit for damages?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2608.377,2609.946,I think the act of bribery.
1975.74-5435,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2614.668,2622.665,"Tell me then, but I gather what is relied on here are the judicial immunity cases?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2622.665,2623.525,Right.
1975.74-5435,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2623.525,2632.686,"Now, suppose a judge takes money and this actually happened as you know, to sell decisions, he is immune, is he not?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2632.686,2634.351,He is as to the decision.
1975.74-5435,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2634.351,2637.022,"No, he is immune from damages for having said?"
1975.74-5435,1,30276,john_p_farrell,,2637.022,2644.939,"I am not sure that those cases are, I have read some of the cases and they usually are suing him for rendering a verdict by virtue of bribery."
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3772.974,3774.438,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-5435,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3818.944,3822.774,"That goes to the merits, however, does it not, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3822.774,3828.296,"Well, I was not going to the merits in the sense Mr. Chief Justice that I meant to imply that either court was right or wrong."
1975.74-5435,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3832.604,3846.397,That does not go to the main issue of the risk of harassment of prosecutors in the diversion of their time from their basic function?
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3846.397,3848.798,I meant to go that point Mr. Chief Justice because I think --
1975.74-5435,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3848.798,3856.016,"Mr. Solicitor General, there has always been attention between state courts, I can say from personal experience in federal habeas corpus?"
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3856.016,3856.356,I am sure there is.
1975.74-5435,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3856.356,3858.19,There is nothing new about that.
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3858.19,3859.88,"No, no."
1975.74-5435,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3859.88,3863.323,I suggest on the issue that we are dealing with today.
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3865.897,3871.746,"Well, in that case I will not pursue the point."
1975.74-5435,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3938.934,3949.49,"At the actual trial of the case, I still have not got it clear in my mind the difference between the prosecutor and defense counsel as to who is a quasi-judicial officer."
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3954.323,3964.338,I do not see Mr. Justice Marshall that should a defense counsel suborn in perjury that he would be liable to anyone in a damage action.
1975.74-5435,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3964.338,3966.723,"Well, I mean is he a quasi-judicial officer?"
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3966.723,3967.796,I assume he is.
1975.74-5435,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3967.796,3968.128,What?
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3968.128,3969.537,I assume he is.
1975.74-5435,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3969.537,3970.731,So there is no difference.
1975.74-5435,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3972.475,3977.864,I think the people engaged in this process are –- Pardon me.
