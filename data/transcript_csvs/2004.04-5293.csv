2004.04-5293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.201,We'll hear argument in Deck against the State of Missouri.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,6.853,10.753,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-5293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,91.151,95.897,Did the... did counsel suggest less intrusive restraints?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,95.897,128.219,"Counsel had filed an extensive motion in which it set forth a number of different ways in which courts in Missouri and in other jurisdictions had dealt with the problem where the... where the courts minimized the effect of the shackles on the jury by hiding them from view such as by placing boxes around counsel table, ensuring that the defendant was already in place in the courtroom before the jurors entered, that sort of thing."
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,131.441,135.444,What was the basic justification in the first place for shackling?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,142.891,150.139,The court did not establish a record for why the shackles were... were warranted.
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,161.656,166.569,Is there any indication that there were or were not present court security officers?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,166.569,171.315,There's nothing in the record as to security officers in the courtroom.
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,171.315,177.054,Who... who should... whose responsibility should it be to get something like that into the record?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,182.793,197.077,"Once defense conviction objects to the use of shackling, it is incumbent upon the State to show that the restraints were harmless, and by doing so, they would need to make a record that--"
2004.04-5293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.077,200.792,What's the authority for the burden of proof question?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,206.077,230.104,"--Well, it's basically Chapman because shackling is an inherently prejudicial procedure, and when the court imposes that without justification, the burden falls on the State to show that it was, in fact, justified or that the shackling was... was harmless and that the jurors could not see it or that sort of thing."
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,230.104,236.708,"So the principle is there's a right not to be shackled, and when the State says that that right has to be compromised, then the State has to have the burden of proof?"
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,236.708,237.618,Yes.
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.618,239.476,And I looked... and I find that rule in Chapman?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,239.476,242.327,"No, it would not be in Chapman."
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.93,265.626,"Those... those are all, are they not, cases involving the... the guilt phase of... of a trial?"
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,265.815,266.725,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.725,268.333,"Well, this is a little different."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,284.02,285.134,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.134,285.756,He was... he was convicted.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,285.756,287.363,"Yes, and--"
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.363,288.932,Should that make no difference?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,288.932,303.671,"--The reason that this presumption applies in penalty phase as well, the presumption of... that shackles are inherently prejudice, it stems from... we could start the analysis in guilt phase."
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.806,312.566,Guilty.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,312.566,318.615,"--dangerous, violent, untrustworthy, and then hence, they are more likely to be guilty."
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.931,344.267,Can... can I ask you?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,357.048,369.68,"Counsel filed a motion saying that there should not be restraints at all, but within that motion, he explained how courts in Missouri had accommodated--"
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.68,370.627,Okay.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,370.627,372.113,--both interests successfully.
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.113,374.425,But he did take the position that there was no need for shackles at all.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,374.425,376.078,"Yes, yes."
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,376.078,402.911,"Back on your earlier part of your answer to Justice Scalia, that it's inherently prejudicial in the sentencing stage, if one of us were to agree or the whole Court, the majority, were to agree with your position and write the opinion out, what would we cite for that, other... other than our... our own assumptions as to how the system worked, judicial notice?"
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,402.911,423.633,"Well, I think that you could follow Holbrook pretty closely and that I think what you'd need to... to deal with is there's a whole bunch of precedent regarding how prejudicial shackling is."
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.108,440.806,"With... with character, we know... we know he's a murderer."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,440.806,451.663,We know that on that day 7 years prior that Carman Deck was dangerous to those people in that situation.
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.718,470.284,Are you sure that it's as... as prejudicial in the... in the penalty phase as it is in the guilt phase?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,521.758,528.445,"Well, Your Honor, in Beck v. Alabama, a similar situation arose."
2004.04-5293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.26,609.52,What are the factors in Missouri that the State would be trying to prove to urge the imposition of death versus life imprisonment?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,615.01,625.041,"Well, there are statutory aggravating circumstances, and the jurors are also allowed to consider non-statutory evidence."
2004.04-5293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,625.041,629.294,Is future dangerousness an issue in Missouri?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,629.294,637.567,"It is not a specific aggravating circumstance, but it's something that is... is certainly relevant and that the jurors can consider."
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,637.567,661.511,"Does your whole case turn on how shackling affects the argument that you're... that the accused is making that he's not dangerous, et cetera, or is there some other different standard that we could use to the effect, say, that it's just not consistent with the dignity in an American courtroom, something like that?"
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,661.511,662.238,Well--
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.238,674.414,Does your whole case turn on whether or not this is prejudicial to the fact-finding process on the specific issues or is there some more general standard?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,674.414,679.904,"--Well, there are certainly other considerations that shackling affects."
2004.04-5293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.167,730.059,"In the prison setting, does he wear such restraints?"
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,746.489,766.263,"No, he would not be unless he was a very disorderly inmate or something like that, but I think most of the jurors would... would know from seeing jail shows and jail movies that inmates are typically not restrained in that fashion so that--"
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.263,767.128,It's--
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.128,767.75,"Well, I mean, I think the--"
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.75,784.589,"--it's still an oppressive reminder of... of how this individual, if sentenced to life, is... is subject to... to the orders of prison authorities which on some occasions will subject him to this kind of restraint."
2004.04-5293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.357,800.565,Are you aware of any cases in which prosecutors have objected to shackling?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,800.565,804.158,"--No, I am not, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.158,807.502,"So Justice Scalia would have, I suppose, but he's unusual as a prosecutor I think."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,807.668,808.29,No.
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.29,831.324,"--Well, I... I think there is... is something to the point that if I'm a juror and the defendant is sitting about as close to me as you are at the counsel table and I see that he can't suddenly jump out at me, I have a certain... certain security in making a deliberated judgment."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,837.64,856.792,"Well, I think... I don't think there's other considerations other than, you know, this is penalty phase of a capital trial where we have to have the reliability of the fact-finding process."
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,941.005,943.273,Let me ask you this.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,960.9,967.959,--Because we are concerned with the reliability of the death sentence.
2004.04-5293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1026.659,1027.568,Is--
2004.04-5293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1027.568,1040.82,"What do you make of the judge... well, the jury, already having been polled, and every one of them said this would not affect our judgment?"
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1040.82,1065.713,"This Court in Holbrook dealt with the same situation, and the Court in that case held that when a procedure presents such a probability of prejudice that it is inherently lacking in due process, little stock need be placed in jurors' claims to the contrary because jurors may not even be conscious of the effects that shackling will have."
2004.04-5293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1093.948,1100.386,--Suppose the judge had said this defendant has just been convicted of killing two people.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1124.624,1130.38,"No, I don't think it would."
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1148.606,1154.467,"I... I think you have to give that answer to Justice... to Justice Breyer, and that's why I'm asking."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1168.379,1169.578,"--Yes, it is."
2004.04-5293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.578,1199.094,"Well, Ms. Percival, would you still be here today with this argument if the defendant had simply had shackles around his ankles that would have prevented him, in... in effect, from running or lunging at anyone, but that that had been concealed by appropriate covers around the table where he was sitting so that the jury was unaware of that situation?"
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1199.094,1199.65,Yes.
2004.04-5293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1199.65,1200.802,Would you still be here--
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1200.802,1201.795,No.
2004.04-5293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1201.961,1207.368,--making this argument that it's inherently prejudicial even though the jury couldn't see it?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1207.368,1224.086,--I would not be here arguing that if the court had gone to... had... had balanced both interests and had limited the risk that this impermissible factor would come into play.
2004.04-5293,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1237.832,1242.995,That wasn't obvious or visible particularly to the jury.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1242.995,1244.027,"--No, it was not."
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1244.027,1255.172,"Well, but then you're giving away the Riggins argument, which is that this somehow affects the psyche of the defendant and he can't fully participate, et cetera, which I thought was your argument."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1255.172,1260.29,"Well, that... that is one of the problems with excessive shackling."
2004.04-5293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.291,1293.354,So can every defendant have leg braces in every case?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1293.354,1295.007,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1295.955,1309.58,"Well, is... you... you have... Justice Kennedy alluded to one of your earlier arguments, and that is the... somehow the... the shackling affects the capacity to participate."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1320.27,1325.267,"Well, there are two different angles on that."
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1347.203,1365.573,"Well, I... I would grant you if... if they... they are so tight that it's causing pain, you've got a separate problem, but short of that, does the so-called capacity to participate suffer simply because he's... he's in irons?"
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1381.343,1393.315,"If the shackles are... are very obvious, it might deter the defendant from coming to court in the first place, lest he be characterized as this dangerous person."
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1393.315,1394.923,Do you know of any instance of that?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1394.923,1397.978,"I cannot cite to any right now, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1398.888,1402.232,But he does have to stand up when the judge comes in--
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1402.232,1403.468,"--Yes, when the--"
2004.04-5293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1403.468,1405.037,--and presumably when the jury files in.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1405.037,1405.492,--Yes.
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1411.89,1425.737,"But your... your problem with that, as I understand it, is simply that at that point with all these chains and so on, he's giving an impression or the State is requiring him, in effect, to give an impression to the jury that may be a... a false impression."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1425.737,1425.987,--Yes.
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1425.987,1426.563,Okay.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1426.563,1427.306,"Yes, it is."
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1427.306,1429.247,But back to participation.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1429.247,1439.582,It could also prevent him from testifying if he knows that he would need to walk from defense table up to the witness box.
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.582,1441.961,But that would be true if he were in the legirons.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1441.961,1444.274,"That... you're right, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1455.17,1455.624,"True, true."
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1455.624,1461.736,But in this case the judge took no remedial measures.
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.909,1482.624,I gather there was some evidence or perhaps it's conceded that he was put on a suicide watch before his first trial.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1484.443,1485.186,Right.
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.422,1492.905,That he had been put on a suicide watch and that he had tried to injure himself by knocking his head against the cell wall?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1492.905,1493.398,--Yes.
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.398,1511.314,What if... what if the judge had specifically stated I'm putting him in irons because the man is... is violent enough towards himself or others that I'm worried about the safety of the jury.
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1511.314,1512.057,Well--
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.057,1513.643,What if the judge had said that?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1513.643,1514.286,--Okay.
2004.04-5293,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.112,1515.938,Would that have been enough?
2004.04-5293,0,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,1515.938,1529.684,"--I... I don't think it would have been in this case because that incident had happened well prior to the first trial, and at the first trial, he was wearing the leg braces underneath his clothing and they sufficed."
2004.04-5293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.122,1555.32,"Yes, you may, Ms. Percival."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1560.149,1565.063,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-5293,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1592.943,1595.915,"Well, isn't... isn't the question whether he... he was dangerous in the courtroom?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1595.915,1597.734,--That is part of the question.
2004.04-5293,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1598.66,1604.3,"There's no question he was dangerous when he committed the murders, but... but I don't know that that means he's dangerous in a courtroom."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1604.3,1610.366,"Well, I think that certainly suggests that he's dangerous right off."
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1616.188,1636.91,"Well, is there some burden on the part of the prosecutor and the court to consider at least alternative restraints or measures to make sure that there's no misbehavior?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1636.91,1648.427,"There may be but prior to that, there... there should be a burden on the defendant to, first of all, articulate that the restraints are visible and make a record on that."
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1649.541,1651.399,"Well, apparently that was done."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1657.965,1660.481,--I think I disagree with the characterization.
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.768,1693.341,Do you... do you take the position that every defendant can be restrained if the restraints are not visible to the jury?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1693.341,1698.83,"--It... it would depend on the nature of the restraints, but if the restraints are not visible--"
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.83,1705.806,Legirons strapped to the leg of the... of the table but not visible.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1705.806,1706.549,--Right.
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.49,1711.834,Why don't you limit it to double murderers anyway?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1711.834,1713.403,Certainly that would be fine.
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.403,1714.33,Okay.
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1714.33,1715.837,"Well, but I want to know what your position is."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1717.285,1724.51,"Again, it... it depends upon the circumstances, but if they're not visible to the jury, the defendant has a difficult time--"
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.51,1729.34,"Well, the circumstances that you were given was a traffic offender."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1729.34,1732.972,--A traffic offender who is restrained where it's not visible--
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1732.972,1735.201,With... with non-visible restraints.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1736.604,1737.142,"--Yes, it is."
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1741.312,1744.117,"It's kind of an extreme position, isn't it?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1744.117,1748.576,"--That's true, but it points up the importance of making a record on the visibility."
2004.04-5293,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1749.485,1750.024,Is--
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1750.024,1752.829,"But this... this is given... I mean, this is legirons."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1764.346,1769.714,"--Well, I... I think there was serious doubt and that's borne out by defense counsel's question to the voir dire."
2004.04-5293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.898,1790.808,What about his motion?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1793.796,1794.356,--One of them.
2004.04-5293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1795.637,1795.97,"All right, fine."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1812.15,1813.098,"--Again, we--"
2004.04-5293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1813.098,1815.206,That doesn't say he can see it... they can see it?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1815.206,1819.952,--I think that's an allegation by counsel that that may be the case.
2004.04-5293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1819.952,1820.324,All right.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1833.288,1836.715,"Well, recall at... at this point the sequence is critical."
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1846.291,1857.232,"Well, are you taking the position here that this record does not disclose that the belly chains and the handcuffs and the other restraints were not visible?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1857.232,1857.808,--Yes.
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.318,1862.887,That there's nothing in the record to show that.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1862.887,1863.259,That's right.
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1863.259,1864.456,And you don't concede it.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1864.456,1865.116,I do not.
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.602,1873.001,"Yes, but your position would be precisely the same if the record made it perfectly clear that the jury could see everything, I think."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1873.001,1874.366,I think the test would be the same.
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.62,1875.025,Yes.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1875.025,1875.852,--That's true.
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.852,1877.421,So this is an alternative argument that you're making.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1877.421,1877.588,That's true.
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1877.588,1885.223,But the State of Missouri is submitting to us the proposition that every defendant in every case can be shackled so long as it's not visible.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1892.82,1899.341,"Well, this points up the distinction in this case between guilt phase and penalty phase."
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1913.913,1917.834,Could he be forced to wear prison clothes once he's convicted and it's the sentencing phase?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1917.834,1920.6,"--I think he possibly would be able to, yes."
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1934.347,1951.353,"But there's no for example here because the court said, in answer to the lawyer's objection... the... the lawyer says, it prejudiced him... prejudices him toward the jury and it makes him look dangerous."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,1970.012,1974.016,"That is the only stated reason, that he has been convicted."
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1996.102,1996.368,Why?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2019.879,2032.139,"What you state is true, but by the time of the penalty phase retrial, Mr. Deck's position, to paraphrase from Martinez v. Court of Appeal, had changed dramatically."
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.971,2048.547,Is the fact of conviction critical for your point of view because it doesn't really matter if there's prejudice or that because there's no... no danger of prejudice?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2048.547,2052.179,I'm not sure I understand your question.
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.179,2067.867,"Well, do you concede that even though he had been convicted, it would, nevertheless, be prejudicial in the eyes of the jury to see a man shackled when one of the issues they'll have to decide is whether his future dangerousness might... might justify his execution?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2073.728,2076.495,I think it would depend.
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.094,2087.639,"And if it depends, why would it not be appropriate to have a rule that the trial judge should be required to explain the basis for his decision?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2087.639,2094.121,"--Certainly here it would have been simpler had the trial court been a little wordier, and that's not the case."
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.903,2129.788,"Yes, but would you not agree that it's always of relevance to a jury in deciding whether the... the man should be executed, is how dangerous is this guy?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2129.788,2133.026,"--Yes, certainly juries can consider that, and jury case law is in accord."
2004.04-5293,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2176.478,2177.843,--But the fact--
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.843,2178.419,Could they put him in a cage?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2178.419,2180.981,Could they put Mr. Deck in a cage?
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2182.217,2183.332,He's... he's been convicted.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2184.258,2184.985,--Right.
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.985,2197.738,"It seems to me your argument is much like arguing on the merits of the... at the original trial that his defense was alibi or something like that, therefore you don't have to worry about the prejudice that arises from the restraints."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2197.738,2202.939,"Well, I think in the penalty phase, we're looking at reliability."
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.893,2220.484,"Yes, but the bottom line from the other point of view is that shackles are always prejudicial, and you try to have the scales evenly balanced when you're deciding whether the man should die or not."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2220.484,2230.986,"In terms of making that decision, it's important to remember that Missouri has procedures in place to channel, at the front end, the jury's decision whether or not to impose death."
2004.04-5293,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2242.199,2272.679,"--Well, the... the stated aggravating circumstances didn't, but the point of... one point of the argument is that by shackling the man in... in this complete and visible way, you are creating the impression that no one could fail to... to perceive that this guy is so dangerous that they can't even depend upon courtroom security either to protect him from the... protect the jurors or courtroom personnel or to prevent escape."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2282.794,2284.302,--Two responses to that.
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2316.336,2321.165,Do we know why the judge apparently changed his mind?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2346.057,2347.46,We... we do not.
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2386.553,2391.011,"Well, how about the ones that were used on Mr. Deck during the trial?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2393.529,2403.726,"--I think it was an alternative in this case, and the defense didn't proffer, at the time of the objection, anything that they thought that might be less."
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2418.049,2421.643,"Well, in part it depends on whose burden it is."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2431.424,2432.788,--I think--
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2432.788,2445.541,"Or do you take the position that they're free to impose shackles in every case, even a traffic offense, if the prosecutor wishes to do it, without any justification?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2447.665,2450.165,"--Well, I think if it's non-visible restraints--"
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2450.165,2451.114,Is that right?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2451.114,2452.494,--I... I don't think that's--
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2452.494,2453.032,Is that your position?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2453.032,2453.237,--No.
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2454.806,2454.973,No?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2454.973,2458.688,"I think if it's non-visible restraints, we have a non-issue."
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2463.162,2473.382,"That's not my question, and... and it relates to what is the burden of the State in these situations to use the visible restraints?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2473.382,2479.698,"--The burden is for the State to show that the restraints were reasonable, were not completely out of proportion--"
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2479.698,2484.239,And where in this record do I find that the State carried that burden--
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2484.239,2485.165,--The record--
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2485.165,2488.493,--and that there was a finding by the trial judge on it?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2488.493,2498.44,"--There was not a finding per se, but the facts of this case, spread upon the record, support the use of restraints in this case."
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2498.44,2505.333,Could you point me to places in the record where it supports your position on the use of the visible restraint?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2505.333,2506.076,Yes.
2004.04-5293,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2518.009,2520.36,Had that not occurred before he was even tried?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2520.36,2521.574,"--That had, yes."
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.227,2525.561,And what were the facts of the aiding escape?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2527.873,2529.376,He was assisting somebody.
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2529.376,2530.308,"I mean, what did he do?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2532.248,2540.216,He... he had a saw blade and he assisted these other individuals in sawing their way out.
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.757,2547.358,Which really has very little probative value on this issue.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2557.184,2558.686,--I... I must disagree.
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2575.965,2581.538,So we already know that... that that effort was made before he was tried in the guilt phase.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2581.538,2582.198,That's true.
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.198,2585.253,"And whatever inference you might draw, it didn't prove out."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2612.002,2613.2,That's true.
2004.04-5293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2664.553,2675.821,"If... if there are some factors that favor putting him in shackles and I guess others might not, what's the argument that the judge shouldn't at least have to make a finding?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2675.821,2679.702,"Again, the question is reasonableness."
2004.04-5293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2683.622,2700.895,"I mean, you know, I realize you want to save the conviction and the penalty, but if you look at the mine run of cases, it's pretty hard for me to see how the State could show special circumstances and they not get a finding from the judge that they're right."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2700.895,2702.077,--We don't--
2004.04-5293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.077,2704.594,It's pretty hard to see an argument against it.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2704.594,2705.725,--We don't--
2004.04-5293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2705.725,2713.055,"I know that hurts your case, but I... I still need to think of some argument or reason why the judge shouldn't have to at least make a finding."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2713.055,2713.51,--Right.
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.353,2795.206,"With a... with a blank record... the... the State is going to restrain someone and it may be necessary, it may be not, and if the State has the burden, then why shouldn't a reviewing court speculate on what might have been when the only thing that was... appears of record is he's been convicted and will remain in legirons?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2829.403,2832.108,I think that's what the court said here.
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.415,2875.659,"Ms. Nield, is... is the State making a harmless error argument here?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2888.207,2888.745,--That's right.
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2889.693,2891.551,Why is that?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2891.551,2903.605,"First of all, again, the defense in mitigation was essentially that Mr. Deck is dangerous, but we ought to spare him the penalty of death because of his poor upbringing."
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.47,2918.095,What... what specific aggravating circumstances did they jury find?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2922.387,2923.13,That's correct.
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.13,2925.98,And the jury found... there are five.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2925.98,2926.845,There were--
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.845,2928.414,And the jury found all five.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2928.414,2929.712,--Actually there were six--
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.712,2930.272,Six.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,2930.272,2932.872,--that were pled in this case and the jury found all six.
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3014.235,3016.631,So... so it's never ground for reversal?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3026.867,3027.981,I think--
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3027.981,3033.1,Your... your... I... I think first position at least would be that it's never prejudicial.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3034.836,3036.072,--I think--
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3036.072,3040.613,How does harmless error work to... to pursue Justice Scalia's line of questioning?
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3040.613,3051.282,"--I think in terms of harmless error, that would be our second position, but the first position here is that a constitutional violation has not been established."
2004.04-5293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3051.282,3051.842,I understand that.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3051.842,3054.442,"And where that's the case, you look at the totality."
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3054.442,3056.011,But answer his question.
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3061.047,3062.616,Where it wouldn't?
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.616,3067.984,"Assuming that it is a violation, what's an example of where it wouldn't be harmless error?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3067.984,3078.302,An example of where it might not be harmless error is where the defendant's defense in mitigation is focused specifically on dangerousness or future dangerousness.
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3111.368,3120.673,"Or I suppose if future dangerousness was a specific aggravating factor under State law, as it is in Texas, for example--"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3120.673,3121.399,Correct.
2004.04-5293,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.68,3128.086,"--then... then you would concede that if this was unlawful, the error clearly would not be harmless."
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3128.086,3129.738,That could certainly make a difference there.
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3163.175,3166.89,"I thought the question here was, was he dangerous in the courtroom?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3171.183,3182.578,"I think that's the question when the trial court looks at the restraints issue, but Mr. Deck is saying that this impaired the reliability of his sentencing under the Eighth Amendment."
2004.04-5293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3220.677,3240.246,"--If he... if he were kept under these restraints, legirons and the... what do they call it... belly chain, day in and day out in prison, would that constitute cruel or unusual punishment?"
2004.04-5293,1,19705,cheryl_c_nield,,3240.246,3241.361,It could.
2004.04-5293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3294.282,3296.057,"Thank you, Ms. Nield."
2004.04-5293,2,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,3301.896,3302.456,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3302.456,3308.4,Could... could you comment on whether or not there's harmful error here?
2004.04-5293,2,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,3308.4,3309.393,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3345.059,3351.496,"Are you asking us to say that in light of six aggravating factors on which he was convicted, the result likely would have been different?"
2004.04-5293,2,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,3351.496,3352.778,"--Yes, I am, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3414.838,3416.862,"That was at this trial or at the first trial, that--"
2004.04-5293,2,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,3416.862,3417.689,--This trial.
2004.04-5293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3479.277,3480.392,May I ask one quick question?
2004.04-5293,2,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,3480.392,3480.625,--Sure.
2004.04-5293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3480.625,3482.228,Does the record tell us how big he was?
2004.04-5293,2,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,3482.228,3484.561,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
2004.04-5293,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3484.827,3485.199,Okay.
2004.04-5293,2,40178,rosemary_e_percival,,3487.018,3487.594,Thank you.
