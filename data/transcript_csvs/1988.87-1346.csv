1988.87-1346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.886,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1346, Bonito Boats v. Thunder Craft Boats."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,65.874,68.244,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.685,149.879,"Mr. Russell, may I inquire preliminarily whether your client could have obtained a patent for its boat hull?"
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,149.879,157.315,"Justice O'Connor, quite clearly boat hulls could be patented, have been patented, in the past."
1988.87-1346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.315,161.937,But your client chose not to try to obtain a patent for it?
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,161.937,168.102,"I don't know whether they tried to obtain a patent or not, but quite clearly the boat in issue in this case was not patented."
1988.87-1346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.102,172.045,Could the boat hull have been registered as a sculptural work?
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,172.045,182.07,"That raises a procedural issue, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-1346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,245.603,248.995,"Excuse me, Mr. Russell, would it not result in affirmance if we bought the argument?"
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,252.018,255.808,"--Yes, I believe the Court can."
1988.87-1346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,255.808,258.369,So we could consider the copyright issue if we decided to.
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,258.369,260.292,"Yes, sir, that's true."
1988.87-1346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.292,269.298,"We can affirm on, on a, a basis not relied upon by the Supreme Court of Florida."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,270.357,271.198,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,271.198,277.773,"But the ground has to have been maintained in that court, as I understand it."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,277.773,280.445,That's my understanding as well.
1988.87-1346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.789,320.162,"Well, the thing that's curious, if the thing... if the boat hull was patentable, it is curious that if the Florida statute is valid it would in effect grant a, a right in perpetuity that under the patent law would be limited."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,320.162,328.948,"The right... may I first back to, Justice O'Connor, and fully answer your, your prior question as to whether it would be a sculptural work?"
1988.87-1346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,441.131,466.837,"Well, it just struck me that if this boat hull could have been patented and wasn't, but the owners of it want to be protected under Florida's special law, Florida's law would give them a right in perpetuity that the patent law would give only for a limited period of time."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,466.837,469.909,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-1346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.415,493.967,"Mr. Russell, maybe this is the same question, but may I just phrase it a little differently."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,503.524,505.445,"Yes, Justice Stevens, that's true."
1988.87-1346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.445,506.546,So it clearly would give--
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,506.546,508.256,They're both unpatentable items.
1988.87-1346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,508.256,521.646,"--But, but the statute would apply even if a patent had issued and expired, so there would be, as Justice O'Connor says, a state law grant in perpetuity of something that the Federal patent had covered?"
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,521.646,529.971,"Yes, and I think that is also true with respect to the master recordings that were protected in perpetuity in the Goldstein case."
1988.87-1346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.306,560.439,"Well, it would clearly be an infringement if the patent had been in effect at the time."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,560.439,569.175,"There would clearly be an infringement, and there was also clearly be a violation of the Florida statute, if it had been copied using the direct holding method."
1988.87-1346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.175,569.716,Right.
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,587.508,599.315,"Justice Scalia, I think the line has already been drawn in the Sears-Compco cases, and that is whether it is the equivalent of the Federal patent laws."
1988.87-1346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.589,622.47,Only the simplest method of copying?
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,622.47,626.754,"Well, I can't say that it's the simplest, Justice."
1988.87-1346,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,654.333,658.316,"Well, then, what's the point of the Florida statute?"
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,658.316,659.708,"It is, it is--"
1988.87-1346,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.708,663.67,"If there are other methods that are easier, then what purpose does the statute serve?"
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,663.67,674.048,"--The statute serves the purpose, Justice Kennedy, of prohibiting as unfair competition a practice which is widespread in the marine industry--"
1988.87-1346,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,674.048,679.731,"Well, but if you're telling us there are a lot of other ways that are easier, then I just don't see what purpose the statute has at all."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,679.731,697.692,"--The purpose has the statute of prohibiting the practice which is prevalent commercially in the marketplace and is being used today to copy boat hulls and to take the investment that the original manufacturer puts in producing a new, a new product on the market, with product improvements."
1988.87-1346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.676,707.487,One suspects it's being used because it's the easiest.
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,723.059,724.741,"Well, it is, it is a difficult process."
1988.87-1346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.913,730.515,"Well, I know, but compared to what?"
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,744.242,753.98,"--It is, it is an easier method to copy than using the traditional methods of developing and preparing a wooden plug."
1988.87-1346,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.92,908.679,"I suppose that some other state might just prevent copying by another manner, just the single... it picks out some other way of copying and says we are preventing copying only in this way."
1988.87-1346,0,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,921.509,923.342,Yes.
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1394.841,1408.55,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.71,1555.277,"Mr. Lipsey, do you acknowledge that there is some room still for state laws to protect trade secrets and to do other similar things for protection?"
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1555.277,1556.046,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.581,1629.145,"Mr. Lipsey, I'd always thought the patent law protects ideas, it protects discoveries as the Constitution puts it."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1659.824,1660.715,"Well, Your Honor--"
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.715,1662.117,"Now, would that violate the patent law?"
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1662.117,1664.648,--It wouldn't... let me address--
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1664.648,1671.591,"Now, the person hasn't patented the house, but has built the house, and there's this Florida law, you can't use a photograph of anybody's house without compensation."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1676.466,1680.968,--Let me answer that by giving you two hypothetical situations.
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.124,1742.308,"Don't, don't state laws all the time prevent people from using another person's product in certain ways?"
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1764.223,1766.254,"--Well, first of all, let me correct a misperception."
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.784,1798.925,Never mind.
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1801.687,1803.53,I must confess I've forgotten the question.
1988.87-1346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.172,1809.795,"Well, the question... I remember the question."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1821.371,1829.336,"--The patent law is concerned with what's in the public domain, and that's a term of art in these cases."
1988.87-1346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.127,1866.158,"What's, what's your answer to the question about that house at 14th Street?"
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1866.158,1885.893,"--Well, I... I'm, I'm getting to that, which is that where the, where the state regulates the right to use something to prevent... to protect the health and safety of its citizens, it doesn't create in that thing an exclusive right in belonging to a private individual."
1988.87-1346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1902.243,1902.743,"No, no."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1923.177,1926.048,"--There, there is a law to that effect, it's grounded in the law of--"
1988.87-1346,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1926.048,1928.429,It's known as the right of privacy.
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1928.429,1930.182,"--That's the right of publicity, that's perhaps--"
1988.87-1346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.182,1934.093,Is the law of privacy inconsistent with the policies of the patent law?
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1934.093,1939.179,"--Not at all, because those are interests which are not addressed at all in the balancing core by Congress."
1988.87-1346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.966,1959.872,"Well, what if this boatmaker had a provision in his regular sales contract that required the purchaser to agree not to copy it?"
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1959.872,1963.054,"Your Honor, I believe that's the next case that you're going to have here."
1988.87-1346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.173,1965.505,How do we decide it?
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,1965.505,1971.89,--I believe that that raises issues of state contract law enforcement.
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.665,2083.282,"I assume a state can say you can't reproduce it by a process that involves nuclear energy, or something of that sort."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2083.282,2083.783,Absolutely.
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.492,2086.313,That's a safety matter.
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2106.626,2107.277,Well--
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.277,2116.303,"I, I, I mean, once you acknowledge the state can limit some of the manners of reproduction, why isn't this a reasonable manner of, of limitation?"
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2121.787,2126.221,"--Well, Your Honor, I had that trying to be fair."
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.832,2128.16,"Oh, maybe you can't even do that."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2128.16,2129.001,"--No, no."
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.911,2212.847,"Isn't there a law requiring licensing of engineers, of mechanical engineers, or whatever kind of an engineer makes a drawing of a hull, I don't know."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2214.687,2216.698,"Creates no private property right, Your Honor."
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.483,2229.398,"No, but it prevents, it prevents somebody from, from taking to his friend, Charlie, who happens to be very good at draftsmanship, this hull and say, Charlie, do me a hull."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2243.635,2251.312,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, it may limit the options in reproduction, but it does so without withdrawing anything from the public domain."
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.741,2253.483,Neither does this.
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2253.483,2254.334,--I beg your pardon?
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.334,2255.384,Neither does this.
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2258.475,2261.047,"But the process of making it is, and the process of--"
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.047,2264.961,"--So in the case I gave you, making it through this... through Charlie os withdrawn."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2264.961,2279.37,"--Well, your... we are disagreeing on the difference between a technological technique, which is the subject of the patent law, and a method of doing business, such as whether you'd use a licensed engineer or an unlicensed engineer, which the patent law doesn't even address."
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.874,2294.199,xxx as you say that the patent law does address manner of reproduction.
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2294.199,2295.131,"No, I--"
1988.87-1346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.131,2296.59,And I don't see that it addresses that.
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2306.588,2321.137,"--Your Honor, the patent law deals with technology, with the skill and art by which things happen in this country, by which things are changed into other things, with science."
1988.87-1346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.642,2382.126,"Of course, you do, you do have statements in the Patterson case that the patent laws were not designed to displace the police power of the state."
1988.87-1346,1,19396,charles_e_lipsey,,2385.989,2392.174,"There is that language, but the same argument that it's police power, it's police power, could have been made in Sears-Compco as well."
1988.87-1346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2593.406,2595.637,"Thank you, Mr. Lipsey."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2597.67,2601.15,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.87-1346,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2671.208,2683.764,"Sears... Sears... Sears-Compco you car say was an exercise of state police power too, if you mean by police power the reserve power of any state to operate in an area unless prohibited by Federal law."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2683.764,2692.689,"--Well, I'm using the term here in the sense that it regulates for the general welfare of the public the health, safety and commerce."
1988.87-1346,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2692.689,2700.686,"How, how does that distinguish... are there, are there some state laws in your view that wouldn't come under the state police power?"
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2700.686,2708.951,"I would... I can't think of one right off hard, Your Honor, but--"
1988.87-1346,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2708.951,2716.075,"Usually it's used just as a, as a shorthand for those laws the state has, has a right to enforce, really."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2716.075,2724.5,"--Well, I think it certainly is clear here that the state has the authority and the power to regulate the conditions of competition within its borders."
1988.87-1346,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.5,2735.719,"You, you may be right, but I think it doesn't depend on whether or not you, you, you use the word ""police power"" in any specialized sense."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2735.719,2736.638,Yes.
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.638,2739.269,"Mr. Russell, can I go back for a second to the Sears case?"
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2746.415,2747.787,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.787,2762.885,"Supposing the record told us that they did it by a molding process or something like, that they... I don't know how... how you'd copy a lamp, but could Illinois have forbidden that one method of copying but lets that any other method is okay?"
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2762.885,2765.987,I think just as Florida could Illinois could too.
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.987,2766.568,So that--
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2766.568,2767.74,"But there is, there is, there--"
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.74,2770.741,--So that... the only thing wrong there was the total prohibition.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2770.741,2772.451,--It was a total prohibition in Sears.
1988.87-1346,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.108,2782.469,It's more than just that it isn't a total prohibition.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2807.695,2809.026,"--Yes, I quite agree."
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2809.026,2813.548,"In other words, you have a statute saying, you cannot use the physical lamp when you're trying to make a copy of it."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2813.548,2814.9,That would be the parallel.
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.262,2822.765,The prohibition applies to something that a copier owns.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2825.166,2826.518,--He bought the hull.
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.518,2827.219,It's his hull.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2827.219,2828.118,"Justice White, you're absolutely correct."
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.118,2832.031,"And the state says, awfully sorry, but you can't make a mold of your hull."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2832.031,2837.065,To copy it and make identical products for commercial purposes.
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2837.065,2837.525,Yes.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2837.525,2838.236,"Yes, that's correct."
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.925,2844.309,"You cannot use your hull, you cannot use your hull, reproduce it in that way for commercial purposes."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2844.309,2846.129,"For commercial purposes, that's right."
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.447,2857.73,"Well, he, he... he's marketed it."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2859.66,2862.802,Not unless he sells enough units.
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.802,2863.901,Well--
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2863.901,2869.237,"He may not be able to sell enough, if the copier's in the marketplace, in order to recoup his investment."
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.237,2871.858,"--That's, that's the problem with everybody who doesn't have a patent."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2876.691,2878.351,That is certainly a risk of the copier.
1988.87-1346,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2879.883,2886.398,"Suppose, suppose that someone took Borito's hull and they copied it by reverse engineering, not by molding?"
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2886.398,2888.418,--Absolutely--
1988.87-1346,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2888.418,2890.118,"And then some... all right, wait a minute--"
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2890.118,2890.528,--Legal.
1988.87-1346,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2890.528,2894.301,--Then someone else takes that and copies it by directing molding.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2894.962,2901.157,"It would technically be within the statute, I think."
1988.87-1346,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2901.157,2905.249,"But there's no, there's no... it's clearly not patentable."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,2905.249,2906.771,Clearly not patentable.
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3031.302,3032.251,"Mr. Russell, let me ask one other question I meant to ask earlier."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,3036.796,3043.919,I don't know offhand whether Georgia has such a statute.
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.919,3045.621,Assuming it does not have such a statute.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,3045.621,3047.181,"Well, then, it certainly would not violate Georgia law."
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.181,3050.774,"Oh, so it just... it only applies in-state--"
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,3050.774,3052.055,It's an in-state statute.
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.055,3052.794,--I see.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,3052.794,3060.471,I wanted to point out that the--
1988.87-1346,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.471,3068.305,"If they caught the Georgia copier in Florida, they could get an injunction against him."
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,3068.305,3071.317,"--If they can find him in Florida, I believe you're right, Justice White."
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.317,3075.111,But I'm assuming he did all the copying in Georgia.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,3076.113,3085.786,"In the Interpart case, it was upheld by the Federal circuit, the actual copying was done in Formosa."
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.831,3094.572,--So you would say if the statute would cover out-of-state copying--
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,3094.572,3098.215,It could if you can get jurisdiction of him within Florida.
1988.87-1346,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.215,3098.966,--I see.
1988.87-1346,2,43226,tomas_morgan_russell,,3098.966,3101.889,"That's exactly what happened, Justice Stevens, in the Interpart case."
1988.87-1346,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3113.286,3115.697,"Thank you, Mr. Russell."
