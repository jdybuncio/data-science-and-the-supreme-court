1992.92-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.677,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-311, Donna E. Shalala v. Richard H. Schaefer."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,46.011,50.135,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.419,213.441,"Well, what if a court makes a mistake?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,222.23,235.37,"In Finkelstein, Justice Scalia, that very argument was made, and the Court rejected that point saying that regardless of the label the district court attaches to its order, it is a judgment and it is final and effective as such."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.37,238.461,It shall be deemed a judgment whether the court says so or not.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,238.461,243.715,"Yes, otherwise a court would simply be free to act contrary to what the statute permits."
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.275,310.819,"Well, now, Mr. Kelley, I think that in the Hudson case, which was the first, that the Government conceded there was no final judgment for Equal Access to Justice Act purposes until the administrative proceeding on remand was concluded."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,310.819,312.231,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.116,324.069,"Well, Melkonyan certainly said it wasn't overturning Hudson."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,324.069,329.425,"--That is certainly true as well, but Melkonyan referred to Hudson as encompassing a narrow class of cases."
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.425,331.245,On sentence six.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,331.245,347.777,"And our submission is that Hudson applies only in sentence six cases because under the terms of sentence four, as the Court interpreted that sentence in Finkelstein and Melkonyan subsequent to Hudson, the Court has concluded that there is no such jurisdiction."
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.777,357.592,And just what is it you think that one of these Social Security claimants should do who wants to have an EAJA claim?
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,378.084,390.453,We quite agree that Congress intended applicants who succeed in litigation against the Government and obtain benefits in which in our case... our position was not substantially justified to get benefits.
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,390.453,394.336,"And the time of the remand, they don't know whether they're going to obtain benefits."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,394.336,402.111,"That is quite true, and that problem is easily solved, we would submit, simply by filing an application at the time Congress has required under the terms of the two statutes."
1992.92-311,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,408.976,415.54,It can also be held in abeyance for the duration of life on this planet so far as the statute is concerned.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,423.878,427.26,"I don't believe that is a problem, Justice Souter, for this reason."
1992.92-311,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,451.117,473.212,"Well, that may be, but there's a third possibility in which the claimant who cannot at the point of remand certify that he is entitled as a winner, that the claimant, in effect, is going to take the benefit of the tolling of the statute until the prevailing... his prevailing party status is clear, and then the 30 days runs."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,473.212,492.404,"Well, that's precisely... in effect, I should say, precisely the submission the Court rejected in Melkonyan, which is that matters should stand in abeyance until the proceedings on remand are finished and the decision of the administrative agency will demonstrate whether the party is a prevailing party, and the time period should then start then."
1992.92-311,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,512.899,514.298,Why would it be... I'm sorry.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,521.366,530.743,"--I suppose that is correct, and perhaps I misspoke, but the point remains that the Court in Melkonyan concluded that that very regime was unauthorized by the statutes."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.298,569.248,"But, Mr. Kelley, if we're talking about what EAJA requires, it... the provision says within 30 days of final judgment, the party seeking the award shall submit to the court an application for fees, not just an application for fees, but an application which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the... blah, blah, blah, and so forth."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,577.022,579.003,"Oh, but he will, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.916,586.177,In the court of appeals.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,586.177,586.959,--In the district court.
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.959,588.229,In the district court.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,596.335,602.562,We contend that he is not entitled to such fees in sentence four cases if Hudson is limited as we have submitted.
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.242,606.653,"Well, then why do you have to wait?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,615.148,617.001,That's exactly right.
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.001,617.912,I see.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,624.647,628.11,"It has never been adjudicated as such, but we agree that it was, yes."
1992.92-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.599,636.845,"And that case held the litigant was entitled to fees for the agency proceedings, didn't it?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,636.845,651.876,"--The case did so hold, and we would submit that the Court's subsequent decisions in Finkelstein and Melkonyan have demonstrated that the statutory authorization for the district court to retain jurisdiction in the manner the Hudson court contemplated is limited to sentence six cases."
1992.92-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,651.876,654.447,Is that a sub silentio overruling of--
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,654.447,656.888,"Well, I don't believe it's an overruling, Justice Kennedy."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.773,673.901,--You say that there's just no fee allowable for attorney's fees and other expenses before the agency--
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,673.901,674.281,Well--
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.281,677.791,--either... or... either initially or on remand.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,677.791,682.936,"--Well, it's quite clear we believe, Justice White, that initially that is certainly true."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.054,725.244,Well--
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,738.133,749.363,"Well, it assumes that you will know what amount of fees you are entitled to to that point, but it is not a known in the law... and we do not believe it makes a mishmash of subsection (b) to supplement a fee application."
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,762.452,768.916,"--Well, Mr. Kelley, the First Circuit and the Eighth Circuit have a different view, don't they?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,768.916,770.388,"Yes, they do, Justice O'Connor."
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,770.388,772.529,And what's the matter with that view?
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,781.194,793.362,The problem with that position we believe that it is inconsistent both with section 405(g) and the terms of sentence four and sentence eight and with this Court's decisions in Finkelstein and Melkonyan.
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.528,808.265,"Well, we certainly were concerned in Finkelstein with the right of the Government to raise its arguments--"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,808.265,809.163,That is true.
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,809.163,809.704,--at that stage.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,812.088,813.277,"That is true, but--"
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,813.277,818.83,Is it conceivable that the judgment is final for one side and not the other?
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,818.83,821.203,"--I would suppose it is conceivable, but--"
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,821.203,822.053,It's kind of odd.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,822.053,835.172,"--We believe it is odd, and the Court in Finkelstein rejected our... I'm sorry... declined to adopt our alternate submission under the collateral order doctrine which would more readily lend itself to one side appealing and not the other."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.054,872.405,"Now, tell me again how... under 2412(d)(1)(B), how does the party applying for a fee within the 30 days show that he is a prevailing party?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,872.405,872.896,He submits--
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.896,876.248,Just because he's a... he has prevailed in the district court?
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,876.248,878.529,"--Well, he has done everything he can to that point--"
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.529,878.68,Yes.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,878.68,879.701,--to be a prevailing party.
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.071,885.966,And... but then... and he has to show that he is eligible to receive an award under this subsection.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,885.966,887.618,He has to show that as well.
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.089,889.751,"Well, how does he show it at that time?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,889.751,903.459,"--The eligibility provision we believe is naturally read to refer to the financial status of the fee applicant, which is further down in section 2412(d), which is having a net worth of less than $2 million."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.541,905.781,Well--
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,905.781,906.712,But in any event--
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.712,920.459,"--why can't the... well, why can't then... why couldn't a fee... the fee be immediately awarded?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,920.459,935.12,"--The reason it could not be immediately awarded is that under current law and as the courts of appeals have held and this Court has recognized in Hudson and Finkelstein, that simply obtaining a remand is not enough to qualify one for attorney's fees."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.243,941.034,"So, you have to actually prevail at the agency level?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,941.034,941.825,That's correct.
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.668,949.973,"Well, then you certainly can't show that you are a prevailing party in that sense--"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,949.973,950.881,--At that point--
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.881,954.214,--because you don't... you have no idea whether you're going to win or lose.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,954.214,958.417,"--At that point, we would acknowledge he cannot state that he is for certain a prevailing party."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.417,968.024,"So, you do have to sort of, as Justice Scalia said, make mishmash out of this provision."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,968.024,971.607,"Well, we would suggest that it is not so much of a mishmash."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.067,976.239,You can't have it both ways.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,976.239,978.61,--is the verb tense of the word is.
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.502,985.455,"You read is to mean will be, and that is not making mishmash of it."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,985.455,986.026,--Well--
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.026,987.759,"Or not even will be, may be."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,987.759,1001.185,"--Well, in any event, we would suggest that the alternative to that view is an amendment to the substantive terms of the cause of action, which is a standalone cause of action provided in section 405(g)."
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1018.887,1021.051,"Well, it sounds pretty unworkable."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1047.721,1048.252,"In recent years, it has been--"
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1048.252,1054.607,"I mean, this thing sounds to me like a real bureaucratic nightmare that you want us to institute."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1054.607,1058.139,"--Oh, I don't think so at all, Justice O'Connor, and let me tell you why."
1992.92-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1077.713,1080.945,"In other words, that's the 40 percent factor?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1080.945,1088.08,"That... in the last 2 years, it has run roughly about a third have not gotten benefits on remand, and that... so, the--"
1992.92-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.08,1095.835,"So, the average of the judicial districts would be, say, 20, 21 applications, and a third of those would result in no fees?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1096.486,1100.88,"--25 perhaps per district, and a third would result in no fees."
1992.92-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1119.824,1126.749,"In all of those, I take it, though, the Government is not substantially unjustified."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1126.749,1127.33,--That is true.
1992.92-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1127.33,1128.078,He still has to show that.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1128.078,1128.598,That is true.
1992.92-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1143.991,1149.216,"If we write a few more cases on this in the next... coming terms, maybe the statistics will break it down then."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1150.035,1150.807,"Well, the--"
1992.92-311,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.807,1151.629,Mr. Kelley--
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1151.629,1152.54,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1992.92-311,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.54,1163.726,"--The more you demonstrate the lack of likelihood of their coming back to get fees, the more you are demonstrating the fact that there's going to be an awful lot of wasted filings because everybody who gets a remand would file."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1163.726,1168.711,We would agree that people who get a remand would thus have to file.
1992.92-311,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.711,1169.44,"And really our... I mean, maybe the statute compels it."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1182.269,1184.352,"No, I don't think that is true, Justice Stevens."
1992.92-311,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.185,1189.758,I'm talking of those who have gotten remands.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1189.758,1195.281,"--Oh, I see, but only a very small number of those will turn out not to be... turn out to be unnecessary."
1992.92-311,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.721,1196.871,Only a small number will be--
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1196.871,1200.985,"About a maximum of a third, in recent years at least."
1992.92-311,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.129,1207.84,"--Oh, all right."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1231.135,1236.25,"We would submit, Justice White, that the statute doesn't permit that to be ignored."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.25,1236.42,Exactly.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1250.399,1252.96,"That's... we believe that that, in effect, is true."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1253.461,1262.688,It's a... you have to do something with the first part of this provision or the last part of the provision.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1262.688,1264.447,"--It's not only these two provisions, Justice White."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.386,1291.006,"Well, but you don't have to play games, do you, if you prevail in the court of appeals whether or not you prevail before the agency on remand."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1308.367,1310.628,"No, Justice Scalia, the Court has never held that."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.419,1313.74,"I know they have, but we haven't."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1313.74,1314.071,"--Yes, you have."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.071,1322.207,And doesn't the scheme make total sense if we hold that you prevail in a sentence four case as soon as you win the court of appeals judgment?
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1336.377,1346.024,"That would go a long way toward solving it, but I would hasten to add that it would also upset a lot of settled law in the lower courts to hold that."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.024,1346.235,In the court of appeals.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1346.235,1346.635,That is correct.
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.847,1348.007,Yes.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1348.448,1353.731,--I was going to get to the point that those cases are... have a lot going for them.
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1353.731,1356.592,"Well, from the standpoint of the Government, I'm sure that's true."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1356.592,1363.789,"Well, they make sense, Justice Scalia, because these people, the claimants, are not after simply getting a remand."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.025,1374.747,"Of course, you have."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1389.439,1391.162,It certainly is a favorable legal ruling.
1992.92-311,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.256,1413.027,"--No, but is it not true that if you have been a prevailing party at that point and if the Government's resistance to the claim at that point has not been substantially justified, isn't there good reason to say that the claimant ought to get his fees up to there whether he wins or loses on remand because he has been put to a lot of unnecessary expense is the theory?"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1414.519,1416.79,"Well, that is true in theory."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.79,1420.152,But the Government wins on remand.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1420.152,1421.954,About a third of the time.
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.954,1425.296,And how can your position be unjustified?
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1425.296,1434.182,"Well, it's theoretically conceivable that your initial decision and your decision to contest it was unjustified, but when you go back and do it right, it turns out that the--"
1992.92-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.182,1438.355,"The real problem here is our decision in Hudson, not in Melkonyan."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1438.355,1448.483,"--Well, we would submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that Hudson, as limited to sentence six cases, is fully consistent with Finkelstein and Melkonyan."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.483,1455.696,"In a sentence six case, you have not won anything because the court hasn't made its decision yet."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1478.124,1480.626,"That is quite right, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1498.18,1500.571,Not to make a holding on what basis?
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1500.571,1505.714,--On the basis Justice Scalia is suggesting that one is a prevailing party simply by virtue of getting a remand.
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.488,1515.12,"If I think that that's the only solution that makes sense out of the statute, how can I avoid... I mean--"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1515.12,1524.266,"Well, we would... I would agree, Justice Scalia, that you should not rule against us on the premise that you're not a prevailing party."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.75,1578.693,"--Well, the... Justice Scalia's suggestion, which is very attractive since it's so simple, but it also would involve deciding here, which has never been decided here before--"
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1578.693,1579.344,--That's exactly right.
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.344,1583.678,--that you're not entitled to fees on remand.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1583.678,1586.46,"That is true, Justice White."
1992.92-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1586.46,1591.572,Which is inconsistent with what we held in Hudson before the Melkonyan gloss.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1591.572,1593.125,"That's right, Justice Kennedy."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.125,1593.683,"Wait, Mr. Kelley."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1600.247,1600.948,"Well, that's true."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.948,1601.158,Okay.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1601.789,1602.35,They are not.
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.051,1607.452,But that is not... but we've never decided it.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1607.452,1608.784,"That's true as well, Justice White."
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.784,1615.54,And have some other courts decided that they are entitled to remand in a sentence four remand?
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1615.54,1616.288,Entitled to fees?
1992.92-311,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.288,1616.969,Entitled to fees.
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1616.969,1622.993,"Well, since Hudson and the subsequent cases in this Court, I don't believe that the lower courts have focused on that issue."
1992.92-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.993,1625.076,"So, it is sort of a wash for the Government really."
1992.92-311,0,45217,william_k_kelley,,1638.977,1645.861,"That is exactly right, and we believe it's very important, if you go on the prevailing party side, to recognize that Hudson fees are not available in sentence four cases."
1992.92-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.493,1649.574,"--Yes, Mr. Kelley."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1650.866,1658.082,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-311,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.536,1760.501,"Well, didn't we say in one of the later cases that Hudson applies only to sentence six cases?"
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1760.501,1768.444,"I don't believe that that was said at all, and Hudson in fact was a sentence four case, as the Government has indicated today."
1992.92-311,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.444,1771.947,"Well, did we say it applied only to sentence four cases then?"
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1771.947,1772.498,No.
1992.92-311,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.692,1796.686,"Well, then what was the limitation on Hudson in one of the... either Melkonyan or Finkelstein?"
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1797.767,1803.611,"Well, Melkonyan and Finkelstein both discussed Hudson."
1992.92-311,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.772,1857.757,"Well, didn't Finkelstein say that Hudson was discussing sentence six remands, not sentence four remands?"
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1857.757,1859.68,I don't think that it explicitly said that.
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.68,1865.554,"Well, don't you think that's the fair import of it when it says it applies to a narrow category of cases?"
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1871.378,1875.802,Our position is that Hudson applies to both types of remands.
1992.92-311,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.585,1881.586,"--No, Hudson didn't, but didn't Finkelstein limit Hudson?"
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1881.586,1883.376,--I don't believe it did.
1992.92-311,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.376,1885.868,You don't read that language as limiting it?
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1885.868,1887.761,"I don't read it that way, Your Honor."
1992.92-311,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1887.761,1899.197,"Well, your position is that Hudson is correct and that the later cases, to the extent they impinge upon Hudson, are perhaps confusing and wrong."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,1899.197,1902.54,"Well, I don't know that I would say that they're wrong."
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.473,1987.995,I think that's contrary to our whole description of what the basic distinction between four and six is.
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2021.128,2033.658,"I would say that the distinguishing feature between the sentence four and sentence six remands is what the statute calls for, which is good cause for evidence, which was not developed in the record."
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2051.98,2055.022,"--Right, so that the case is really not over in the district court--"
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2055.022,2055.413,--Right.
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.413,2056.451,--under sentence six.
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2056.451,2056.882,Yes.
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.882,2058.594,But it is over under sentence four.
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2058.594,2059.234,Well--
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.234,2069.471,"Somebody has won and you go back, just as any other administrative agency case is remanded after the agency has reversed and the case is remanded for continuation of the agency action."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2069.471,2070.86,--Let me turn to that.
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.86,2071.522,But the lawsuit is over.
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2071.522,2080.579,"Let me turn to that and discuss why, even if that is true, Justice Scalia, that does not start the time limit ticking for EAJA fees."
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.389,2081.54,Right.
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2083.389,2094.666,"--And the reason that it doesn't start the time limit ticking is because that decision, that sentence four remand, is not appealable by the claimant, while it is appealable by the Secretary."
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.954,2120.456,"Of course, he can't appeal it because he has won."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2124.108,2124.958,Sentence four remand.
1992.92-311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.958,2125.428,"Well, he has won."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2128.511,2128.801,That's right.
1992.92-311,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2128.801,2146.102,"So, maybe at that juncture, as Justice Scalia has suggested, maybe at that point, the claimant is entitled to seek EAJA fees for the court proceeding that resulted in a sentence four remand order."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2146.102,2151.144,"And that may, in fact, be the case, as was discussed previously by counsel."
1992.92-311,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2152.636,2152.806,All right.
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2169.597,2172.711,--Actually it would not affect our case.
1992.92-311,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.363,2269.334,Is there any court of appeals that holds that you don't have to be a... to win below to be a prevailing party?
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2269.334,2272.646,I don't believe that that has been held.
1992.92-311,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.646,2277.529,But there are a lot of courts of appeals that say that you do have to prevail below--
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2277.529,2278.37,"Right, that you must--"
1992.92-311,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.37,2279.382,--to be a prevailing party.
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2279.382,2282.384,"--Right, that you must win your benefits to be the prevailing party."
1992.92-311,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2282.793,2284.395,"Well, is that correct?"
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2302.335,2307.359,You've prevailed in the sense of a sentence four.
1992.92-311,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2318.168,2321.22,"So, that certainly is a potentially workable theory."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2337.602,2346.347,"Unless this Court held that to effectuate Hudson, that a second petition for EAJA fees was possible for the administrative work if the claimant prevailed."
1992.92-311,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.347,2360.959,"Well, yes, but as the Chief Justice has noted and I think others, the Court has limited Hudson and has distinguished between section... sentence four and sentence six remands."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2360.959,2370.664,I think what... Justice O'Connor what you're suggesting is probably true as to the practical effect of a decision that the claimant became the prevailing party upon remand.
1992.92-311,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2380.44,2380.48,Yes.
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2388.827,2394.341,"That's possible, but there would not be the Hudson fees added on later."
1992.92-311,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.642,2416.634,"Well, I would think you would embrace Justice Scalia's proposal if you assume that you're not going to get fees for your work after remand."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2416.634,2422.057,"And as we have... as I have indicated, Justice White, we would not be opposed to such a ruling."
1992.92-311,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.057,2446.643,"Yes, and if... I would think you would just like to be able to collect fees immediately and... because your fee won't depend on whether or not you win below, but you will still want to win below for your... on behalf of your client."
1992.92-311,1,39251,randall_j_fuller,,2446.643,2447.665,Yes.
1992.92-311,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,3310.127,3312.198,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-311,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.449,3360.851,"Thank you, Mr. Kelley."
