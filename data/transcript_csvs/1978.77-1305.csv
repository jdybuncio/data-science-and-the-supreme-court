1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.9,"We'll hear arguments next in 1305, Parklane Hosiery against Shore."
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,11.475,14.776,Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,232.039,239.861,"Do you say “similar,” are they more than similar?"
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,239.861,251.426,"They are precisely the same, Mr. Justice Burger, as the issues contained in the amended complaint or embraced in the amendment."
1978.77-1305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,544.724,550.211,"And Blonder-Tongue, of course, in volved the validity vel non of a patent."
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,550.211,550.6,It did.
1978.77-1305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,550.6,551.409,Didn't it?
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,595.189,597.517,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,607.135,612.313,"Well, in question -- in my case, there is now."
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,636.472,653.8,"Well, Your Honor, in -- I don't think -- well, addressing myself to the question as I understand it, the person seeking to avoid estoppel in the second case that you put would, in all events, be entitled to a trial."
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,687.661,695.105,"Well, what difference does it make as to who initiated the case in terms of the legal principles involved?"
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,695.105,695.931,"Well, Your Honor --"
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.931,699.854,"I mean, the choice of a jury waiver would be one, I suppose."
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,699.854,710.627,"It would and, Your Honor, while I -- as I think we will see, in the context of this case, it is not at all essential to the disposition of this case."
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.667,826.372,"Mr. Levitt, I'm sorry to go back to Justice Stewart's question."
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,826.372,826.731,"Surely, Mr. Justice."
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.731,829.096,I'm really not entirely sure I understand your answer.
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,834.326,834.655,In my judgment --
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.655,835.903,I thought you said you didn't think it was.
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,835.903,838.925,"In my judgment, sir, there should be."
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.925,839.652,There should be?
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,839.652,840.089,Yes.
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.089,846.157,"And -- but, is it not correct that, unless we draw that distinction, Blonder-Tongue decides this case?"
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,846.157,847.432,"I don't think so, sir."
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.432,848.111,"Then, why not?"
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,849.369,851.982,"I don't think so, sir, for several reasons."
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.439,891.89,That's right.
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,891.89,894.395,Deserves a different test.
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1064.083,1069.267,Isn't that only relevant to the -- where there's adequate motivation to go all out and making a complete defense?
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1069.267,1069.906,"Yes, well --"
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.906,1075.104,Wouldn't the defendant -- wouldn't your client have the same motivation to defend against the Securities and Exchange Commission --
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1075.104,1075.202,I don't --
1978.77-1305,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.202,1075.978,Than it does in a damage situation?
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1075.978,1079.252,"Your Honor, I don't think it's only a matter of motivation."
1978.77-1305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1100.031,1122.533,"But they -- I suppose the difference between the hypothetical case embodied in my question and those three cases that you've just mentioned to us and the conclusion implicit in Mr. Justice Stevens' question is that, here, there was no -- you couldn't have gotten a -- you couldn't have had a jury trial in the first action no matter how hard you tried."
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1122.533,1123.781,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.709,1130.767,You simply had no right to a jury trial.
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1130.767,1131.486,Yes.
1978.77-1305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1135.077,1135.315,Doesn't give it.
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1135.315,1153.831,"Evidencing a policy very well-expressed in the government's amicus brief here that the SEC was authorized by the government to move quickly and flexibly to enjoin ongoing wrongs and, therefore, there should be no jury, classic equity jurisdiction, and no jury trial right."
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1153.831,1162.521,Wouldn't this be equally true of any equity case in a Court as distinguished from a regulatory agency?
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1162.521,1177.77,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so because of the implications for most civil litigation of the federal rules, and that in fact relates us precisely to the Beacon Theatres case which is the heart of what the Second and the Fifth Circuit seemed to have been arguing about."
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1177.77,1180.742,"Well, that's not tracking -- perhaps, I didn't make my question clear."
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1180.742,1182.289,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1182.289,1191.347,"No jury in an SEC case, not even a discretionary power arising, I suspect, on the part of SEC to call a jury in?"
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1191.347,1191.734,Correct.
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.734,1204.657,"An equity judge could conceivably have the power from some factual question unusual, but he could call in a jury and submit certain questions, couldn't he, possibly?"
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1204.657,1205.783,"Possibly, yes, sir."
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1205.783,1206.28,It's been done.
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1206.28,1206.33,Yes.
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1206.33,1219.67,"It isn't the normal, but what's the basic difference if the case is tried to judgment in the Equity Court with no jury and the case is tried to a determination in the SEC with no jury? Why do you distinguish those two?"
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1219.67,1226.003,Let me tell you why I do because I think that distinction goes very much to the heart of the issue presented here.
1978.77-1305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1388.169,1397.783,"But isn't it true that the whole presupposition of Beacon Theatres was that if the equity case were tried first, it would be res judicata?"
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1397.783,1399.168,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1400.166,1404.671,"You know I dissented in that case, so I'm perhaps not -- don't understand it as well as you do."
1978.77-1305,0,31550,jack_b_levitt,,1404.671,1407.214,With the greatest -- [Laughter]
1978.77-1305,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.999,1810.075,Thank you.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,1823.984,1827.941,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1894.56,1903.549,"But you have to parlay that together with the Non-mutuality Doctrine which did not existed in 1791, don't you, in order to make your case come out alright?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,1903.549,1904.916,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.25,1910.783,And you got to win both of them there?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,1910.783,1911.391,That's correct.
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.236,1915.412,"And you have, so far."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,1915.412,1917.885,I think the Blonder-Tongue has already been won.
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.885,1920.111,Your point is you won each of them and now you're just combining them.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,1920.111,1924.82,That's correct.
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1924.82,1926.135,You haven't won each of them.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,1932.752,1937.331,"I'll take whatever benefits of their victories I can, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.271,1963.238,"Here, is it -- is the claim in this case on a collateral estoppel that the prior litigation determines not only the factual issues that were raised and decided but a legal issue too?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,1963.238,1974.085,"The -- in the SEC action, the District Court and the Court of Appeals, affirmed unanimously, found that there were material misstatements in the subject proxy statement."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.085,1975.54,And a violation of the statute.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,1975.54,1980.72,"And a violation of the statute, that's correct."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.651,2000.094,Do you think that is a -- purely a factual question?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2000.094,2002.09,It's a mixed question of fact and law.
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.09,2005.71,"That's what I want -- so -- but, collateral estoppel reaches that far at least, you think."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2005.71,2007.116,"Yes, but it --"
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.116,2015.72,"Not just historical facts, but some characterization of them in terms of the statute."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2015.72,2016.998,"Yes, I believe it does, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.732,2033.119,There would be preclusions to whether these particular statements had been made.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2033.119,2034.327,"Well, it's more than that, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.852,2043.575,But is it -- you mean misleading within the meaning of the statute or not?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2043.575,2065.838,"Yes, I mean misleading to the public shareholders of the company, that they thought, for example, that one of the findings of misleading statement was that there were no negotiations going on with the Federal Reserve Bank as to the negotiations to buy out a lease hold, Parklane."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.838,2079.092,"Do you think your motion for summary judgment that you've just described, in response to Justice White's question, should've been granted by a Court before Blonder-Tongue was decided and while Triplett was still the law?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2079.092,2086.395,"Your Honor, there had been -- there has been an erosion of the Doctrine of Mutuality."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.679,2102.496,"Well, suppose you deal with just with the cases from this Court, since I for once, I don't pretend to be familiar with all the Court of Appeals cases."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2102.496,2111.894,"I would think that, before Blonder-Tongue, that this Court did not approve the mutuality but required mutuality."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.894,2120.15,"So, you then rely on Blonder-Tongue outside of the patent area and as a virtually an absolute rule that justifies summary judgment in this case?"
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.15,2121.597,And offensive as well as the offensive.
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.597,2122.064,Yes.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2122.064,2123.661,"Yes, I do."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2211.546,2218.021,What could they have done in order to obtain a right to jury trial in the private action in this case?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2218.021,2231.995,"They could have sought to expedite the private action instead of, for example, spending seventh months after the complaint was filed to answer the complaint."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.488,2244.099,"But, ordinarily, the gov -- the SEC action will have a priority that the private action won't, won't it?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2244.099,2251.083,"Unless the private action is ready for trial at the time -- prior to the time that the SEC action is brought, that's correct."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2292.258,2295.659,"You can require them to answer in 20 days, can't you?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2295.659,2307.754,"As a matter of courtesy between attorneys, when I was constantly being asked for three-week adjournments, four-week adjournments on the answer, it seemed to me, if they want three weeks, they could have three weeks."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.117,2335.117,How far do you carry this particular role?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2342.416,2352.815,"Well, under the Doctrine of Collateral Estoppel, we -- there would've been no right to collateral estoppel on the part of the company against the plaintiff."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.815,2357.122,"Well, there'd been findings in its favor and on the same issue in another case."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2357.122,2358.988,But we would not have had our day in Court.
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.152,2390.721,"But, if that's the case, isn't this invariably going to give the private plaintiff two bites that that appellee can just hold back until after the government's case is tried?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2398.183,2401.544,If the government loses --
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.544,2406.649,"If the government loses its case, the private plaintiff, by your answer to Justice White, isn't bound."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2413.595,2422.35,"Well, as to the second part of your question, the -- I believe one of the purposes of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to act to protect the public."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.31,2448.94,"Well, take the antitrust statute where, as I recall, there's a provision that in certain circumstances, and this is by act of Congress, judgment in favor of the government can be used as a prima facie case."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2452.157,2468.99,"That's correct, Your Honor, but what we have is a situation where, it seems to me that, in the antitrust context, Congress is limiting whatever collateral estoppel effect there might be to an antitrust action brought by the government in the private action."
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2468.99,2476.037,"But, don't you think the intent of Congress when it passed that in the Securities and Exchange Act was to give private claims a benefit rather than a detriment?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2476.037,2481.394,It may have been at the time to give them a benefit and to the extent that it was meant to give them a benefit.
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.752,2502.957,"No, but that just leaves it -- it still leaves it up to the jury."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2502.957,2503.602,But if neither party present --
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.602,2504.301,Doesn't it?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2504.301,2505.167,But if neither party present --
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.167,2511.285,You wouldn't preclude any -- you would want to direct a verdict on the particular facts in this issue.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2511.285,2532.782,"Mr. Justice White, if I may, by rendering prima facie effect to the decision in the antitrust action, if neither side presents any evidence at that point in a private action which is based on a government action brought against the same defendant, the plaintiff will win the private action."
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.96,2551.316,"But, Mr. Rosen, that's no answer because if there's a jury sitting there and the defendant wants to put in evidence, he can do so."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2555.216,2557.661,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2558.699,2558.792,It seems to me that you --
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2558.792,2560.156,I'm not suggesting that he doesn't have --
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.156,2576.863,"It seems to me that your position, effectively, it either treats antitrust cases differently than other government litigation or else it goes further than Section 5 of the Clayton Act and says, instead of being a prima facie effect, it's conclusive effect, giving effect as he is to add to what Congress granted to plaintiffs."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2576.863,2584.191,"It -- when Congress passed the Clayton Act, the question of mutuality was still a requirement."
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2584.191,2585.241,The law has developed since then.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2592.711,2594.278,"That is my view, Your Honor, and I --"
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.278,2605.532,So you think in antitrust actions prior decree is remotely just prima facie but they were buying it now.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2605.532,2607.696,I don't think so because --
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.696,2610.668,I thought you just said that to Mr. Justice Stevens?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2610.668,2611.377,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.539,2618.05,You don't want to say now that the statute is obsolete.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2618.05,2636.907,"The statute may be obsolete, but it's still the only congressional mandate that the Court has to follow in determining what effect, in a private action, the decr -- the decision in a government antitrust action should have."
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.486,2646.037,"And as long as that statute is on the books, Blonder-Tongue doesn't apply?"
1978.77-1305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.037,2646.285,"No, Mr. --"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2646.285,2648.958,"It would not appear to apply to any antitrust actions, that's correct."
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.958,2659.958,Why shouldn't we take it as a legislative policy position with respect to what prior government decrees generally should stand for in later litigation?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2659.958,2669.871,"Because it's not part of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Congress, in passing the Securities and Exchange Act in 1934 knew that it could've put in such a provision, having done it in the Clayton Act in Section 5."
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.871,2670.69,"No, but that Section --"
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.69,2679.694,"Well, I know, but at that point, it d -- there was no -- they would have had to be one that give plaintiffs some benefits because then there was a mutuality requirement."
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.694,2691.837,"You know, that section of the Clayton Act has been amended three times since the Blonder-Tongue decision, 1974 and 1976 and 19-something else."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2693.751,2694.051,Perhaps Congress --
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2694.051,2696.344,It's about changing the prima facie factor.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2696.344,2700.366,Perhaps Congress intends there to be a special rule for antitrust actions.
1978.77-1305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2701.744,2709.736,I think each of those amendments was designed to help plaintiffs in antitrust cases too?
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2709.736,2725.593,"Mr. Rosen, I didn't understand whether or not you conceded the correctness of my brother Rehnquist's assumption in his question to you, that the plaintiff gets to the effect that the plaintiff gets two bites at the apple if the government loses."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2739.227,2740.153,"That's correct, Your Honor, and the --"
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2740.153,2740.263,Why?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2740.263,2741.119,And then the reverse --
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2741.119,2747.926,"Well, let's say in the SEC case that the Court had found as a fact that there were no material misstatements."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2747.926,2750.189,Right.
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2750.189,2754.112,"Now, wouldn't that be a benefit to the defendant in your lawsuit?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2754.112,2763.475,"You're going to have a problem whichever way the case is decided because if you decide for the defendant in this action, the defendant will have two bites at the apple."
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2767.235,2776.261,"Now, why, just to get back to my question, why wouldn't the defendant be able to use that determination in the prior lawsuit?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2776.261,2776.419,Because --
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2776.419,2780.708,That there were no material misstatements by -- in this proxy material or whatever it is?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2780.708,2790.544,"Because the plaintiff would not have had his day in Court, would not have had the chance to present his witnesses who the SEC might not have called."
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2825.065,2834.332,"So, I am -- I was correct in my apprehension that you conceded the correctness of the proposition implicit to my brother Rehnquist question."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2834.332,2836.468,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2836.468,2842.938,It's the polysyllabic way of -- excuse me.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,2842.938,2862.695,"This Court has recognized, as recently as 1966 in the Katchen against Landy case, that a decision in an equity action against one party will have preclusive effect against that party in a subsequent legal action."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.173,3018.334,"Do you know any other instances under federal statutes where federal decrees are considered in -- to any extent in private litigation, besides the antitrust laws?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,3018.334,3030.826,In the --
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.826,3032.283,What are you reading from?
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,3032.283,3033.561,"From my brief, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.903,3076.056,"Is that -- I'm wondering, what are their statutory provisions that call for some kind of preclusive effect, besides the anti trust laws?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,3076.056,3078.354,"I'm not aware of any, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.57,3093.403,And I take it you would--
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,3093.403,3096.601,Looking at whether there's a full and fair adjudication in the prior action --
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3096.601,3106.532,"You would make the same argument, I suppose, if there's an administrative agency determination that's been enforced in a Court of Appeals."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,3106.532,3110.824,"Your Honor, not necessarily."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.679,3146.959,"Well, are you-- would you suggest that it would have to be in a Court of law, the prior-- the estopping judgment has to be from a Court of law, not an agency, I take it?."
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,3146.959,3148.065,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.095,3174.194,"Well, would you -- I take it then you wouldn't limit it to a determination in the Court of law at the behest of an agency?"
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,3177.216,3178.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.877,3186.132,Somebody who doesn't really represent the shareholders of the public.
1978.77-1305,1,41915,samuel_k_rosen,,3186.132,3205.732,"It's like the cases in which there had been the cases which have approved the use of -- the affirmative use of collateral estoppel, the airplane crash case, the automobile case, and the mortgage case which were referred to by counsel for the petitioner."
1978.77-1305,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3265.907,3266.666,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
