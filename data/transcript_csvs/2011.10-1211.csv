2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.737,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-1211, Vartelas v. Holder."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,8.27,11.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,81.485,85.204,"As far as going forward is concerned, that's -- that's just the way it is, right?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,85.204,90.258,"--Yes, because Congress has expressly changed the law post-IIRIRA."
2011.10-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,96.495,114.373,"Could they -- could they -- the -- the person who -- who is here and then the new law is passed, could that person have petitioned for discretionary relief before traveling?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,114.373,117.408,"Yes, Your Honor, that is a possibility."
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,130.735,145.827,"So your expectations argument is that somebody trying to figure out whether to go ahead and rob the bank is going to say, well, if I do and I am caught and I am found guilty, I won't be able to take temporary trips abroad, so I'm not going to rob the bank?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,145.827,146.977,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,162.187,180.568,"You are concerned under Landgraf, I think, with whether or not it disrupts settled expectations, and it just doesn't seem to me that this issue enters into the expectations at all when the pertinent act, which is the commission of the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,180.568,187.237,"--No, Your Honor, I believe the practical impact is a new travel disability or penalty, just as in Landgraf."
2011.10-1211,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,210.853,218.107,What is the difference between someone who commits the crime just before the act is passed and someone who commits the crime just after the act is passed?
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,230.75,235.485,Congress of course has the power to change things.
2011.10-1211,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,248.978,260.353,"But the person who commits the crime just after the act is passed had the expectation prior to that time, that had -- if he did certain things in the future he wouldn't suffer certain consequences."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,260.353,274.779,"--And yet Congress has -- has affirmatively warned and put everybody on notice that now there is this new consequence; you may be deterred by this new consequence; we may be punishing you by this new consequence, but the consequence has been announced."
2011.10-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.779,280.516,"Mr. Bibas, I have -- this is almost a question of personal privilege."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,437.318,438.201,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.091,448.859,Why would it be limited just to the foreign sovereign immunities context?
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,448.859,451.459,--That -- that's the majority's approach.
2011.10-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.947,457.732,Why do you say that's the majority's approach?
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,457.732,459.599,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.439,470.989,Its -- its holding.
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,470.989,471.739,Yes.
2011.10-1211,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,497.357,502.761,"Well, Mr. Bibas, how is it different then from a felon in possession statute, where you look at the past offense--"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,502.761,503.278,Right.
2011.10-1211,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,503.278,508.915,"--and then you say, well, this man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun in the future?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,510.198,512.449,"Your Honor, there are five pertinent distinctions."
2011.10-1211,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,573.09,577.825,"Well, why isn't the -- the government, Congress, making the exact judgment same judgment here?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,595.953,598.572,"--Your Honor, I believe the two are quite different."
2011.10-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,658.529,678.54,"The career criminal enhancements, instead of the felon in possession, and assuming your arguments, what limits can Congress put on anyone with respect to future conduct if it's going to be a burden?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,690.182,700.873,"--Yes, Your Honor, and as we noted in the criminal context, this Court in Witte and Gryger notes, it's a heavier punishment on the new crime because it's aggravated, because it's repeated."
2011.10-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,731.875,750.087,Does that argument that you just made go more to whether or not the BIA's conclusion that Congress intended to rescind the Fleuti decision -- but you assume that's what its intent was?
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,750.087,753.638,--We've assumed arguendo because that's the premise of the question presented.
2011.10-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,753.638,761.394,"So if we assume that, if we assume that was Congress's intent, doesn't that start give you the conclusion?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,769.914,772.616,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't."
2011.10-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,787.793,788.212,"No, no."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,790.914,791.263,--Right.
2011.10-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,791.697,803.487,"If you assume Congress intended to rescind the prior doctrine, isn't that proof itself that it intended to apply the statute retroactively?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,803.487,804.071,"No, Your Honor--"
2011.10-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,804.071,804.937,To this conduct?
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,804.937,805.673,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,867.845,872.315,"Well, that event is the event that the government cares about, which is the entry into the country."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,886.324,897.464,"Yes, Your Honor, but this is an effect test, and under Martin v. Hadix and Landgraf, we have to take a commonsense functional view of what the effects are, the new legal consequences."
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,898.049,915.327,"I would have thought your answer to my colleague would be: No; what they want to regulate is the staying in the country, and they're trying to make that as uncomfortable as possible in order to encourage the individual to leave."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,945.113,957.337,"--Yes, Your Honor, you're right that, particularly given the strange way in which its written, it's hard to understand it as something other than a penalty and possibly a deterrent, but certainly a penalty based on past crimes, to make life uncomfortable."
2011.10-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.357,998.914,But there are a lot of -- but there are a lot of statutes which we interpret to be valid and not retroactive which have a substantial effect.
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1043.61,1058.97,"Well, setting aside the difference between the ex post facto context and the civil context, and there is the procedural distinction, which I know Your Honor didn't sign on to, it's also relevant that here it is directly expressly tied to a past conduct."
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1121.043,1135.286,"Does it matter in the examples that you just gave that admission to the United States is purely a matter of legislative grace, while we might conclude that teaching, being a member of the bar, whatever, is not?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1135.286,1138.088,I don't believe that that is important.
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.428,1148.028,I'm sorry?
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1150.146,1152.582,--The privilege of teaching or the privilege of holding office.
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1154.232,1157.667,"I suppose that might have been regarded as such then, but not under current law."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1157.667,1158.235,--Okay.
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1219.774,1221.409,When they decide to plead guilty.
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1224.777,1235.083,"--We don't claim that there is a reliance interest in committing the crime, but in the decision to plead guilty as a practical matter the defendants weigh a number of consequences."
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1244.105,1245.44,So this -- so this--
2011.10-1211,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1245.44,1257.932,"So you draw the line on -- your position is that only those who have entered a guilty plea are entitled to the presumption against -- non-retroactivity, but not those who have been found guilty?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1257.932,1264.769,"Your Honor, our primary position is that because reliance isn't necessary all of them benefit from it, because they all have settled expectations."
2011.10-1211,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1264.769,1267.721,How do you explain St. Cyr if reliance isn't necessary?
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1269.573,1270.206,Yes.
2011.10-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.902,1318.071,"We are trying to figure out what Congress intended, right."
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1351.294,1351.894,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.894,1352.677,Okay.
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1352.677,1356.279,That is the background default rule against which Congress legislates.
2011.10-1211,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1370.871,1378.861,"Well, do you have any case in which a court has deemed its statute retroactive even though it wasn't triggered until the party took some further action?"
2011.10-1211,0,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1388.4,1389.267,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1416.419,1417.352,"--Thank you, Counsel."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1424.256,1427.292,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1448.707,1450.29,What do you think the trigger to be?
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1460.681,1470.553,That's -- I mean they are closely connected together in time and they both -- but they both postdate the enactment of the statute.
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1522.253,1525.038,"Counsel, I have to -- I just don't understand this statute."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1536.162,1539.464,I think there are two points to be made about that.
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1548.403,1549.087,Right.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1549.087,1553.641,"And the second, I think to understand it, it's helpful to look at the history."
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.27,1576.572,"Well, I know, and I understand that there is a limitation on actually deporting the person."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1592.166,1598.32,--I think what the -- history shows that it's the crossing the border that has always been regarded as a legally significant event.
2011.10-1211,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.105,1600.938,It wasn't before.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1652.404,1664.614,"--Well, I think, I think the most important point about the consequence of the plea is that as an immediate result of the plea under pre-IIRIRA law, so at the time he pleaded guilty in 1984, he made himself inadmissible."
2011.10-1211,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1668.266,1677.605,"I meant to use ""lawyer"" talking to his client, and the client wants to know: Before I enter this plea, what will be the consequence for me?"
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1687.728,1692.714,"--I think the lawyer should have said: By pleading guilty, you are making yourself inadmissible to the United States."
2011.10-1211,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.149,1695.833,Rosenberg would have been the law.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1700.137,1701.253,--That's right.
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1715.98,1718.682,"Well, that's what is going to be important to the person, right?"
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1739.595,1741.045,--That's right.
2011.10-1211,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.224,1768.515,"That's true, but in St. Cyr, as I read it, on pages 322 and 23, the Court focused directly, not on the crime point of time, but the time of the guilty plea."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1855.837,1865.695,"I think you have correctly described the reasoning of the Court in St. Cyr, and I think that that reasoning highlights two ways in which this case is significantly different."
2011.10-1211,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.392,1892.662,"No, but I -- isn't my question the key question?"
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1922.697,1937.207,"--The conclusion to the first part of the answer is that it wouldn't make a difference because what matters here is not the guilty plea, what triggers the application of 1101(a)(13)(C) is the underlying criminal conduct."
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1937.207,1941.925,"You are quite right, Mr. Miller, as a formal matter that that is true, that that's the words of the statute."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1954.402,1957.37,I don't have any--
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1957.37,1962.674,"I can't imagine that it's like more than on one, you know, five fingers of your hand."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1967.742,1970.611,"--Well, I would say that -- this is a statue--"
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1970.611,1973.313,Or after trial or convictions by guilty pleas.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1973.313,1979.384,"--The statute is being applied by, in the first instance, by customs officers at the airport or at the land border crossing."
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2004.934,2013.707,"If, as a fact of the matter, the way the commission of crime is proved in this area is through showing a conviction, does your distinction stand up at all?"
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2013.707,2035.304,"I mean, there is still, I think, a significant formal distinction and then there is also another important distinction from St. Cyr which is that that was the case where as a result of the guilty plea plus the change in law, the person there faced immediate deportability with no prospect of discretionary relief."
2011.10-1211,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2058.236,2059.186,What about the characterization?
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2086.069,2087.119,--Right.
2011.10-1211,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2117.691,2138.204,"But isn't that the case here, meaning -- it goes back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, what they're trying to do is punish those individuals, those LPRs who have committed this kind of crime, by not letting them travel or come back in."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2151.362,2161.903,"I mean, I think when you look at the statute as a whole, you see that it's a -- the comprehensive regulation of crossing the border, which has always been regarded as a legally significant event."
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.619,2199.26,What -- what is the -- what is the policy underlying the rule that doesn't allow somebody who has lawful status here to go to his grandmother's funeral--
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2199.26,2200.779,--I -- I--
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2200.779,2201.144,--and come back?
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2208.382,2221.608,"--I mean, I -- I think it reflects a -- a judgment on the part of Congress over many, many years that it is one thing to say to an alien, all right, we're not going to go and try and find you and take you and kick you out of the country."
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2229.964,2230.598,Okay.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2238.32,2255.096,"I mean -- other than, you know, referring you to -- to the history and to -- to the idea that has been reflected -- this Court has recognizes that control over the border is a core sovereign prerogative that lies at the heart of Congress's immigration power."
2011.10-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.848,2266.987,"Well, I suppose you could say that there's a -- a likelihood of quite inequitable enforcement if indeed you adopt a position we're going to pick up all of these people and send them away."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2294.187,2295.204,--That's right.
2011.10-1211,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.87,2301.191,"So why do you -- as I read the statute, it isn't even clear whether it overrules Rosenberg v. Fleuti."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2356.861,2369.335,"--I think -- if I could just first address the -- the question of whether the statute in fact ever gets Fleuti, and just to be clear on that -- the question presented assumes that it does."
2011.10-1211,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2418.851,2423.069,"Prior to the Fernandez case, the illegal act remained."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2444.75,2446.519,--Well--
2011.10-1211,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2446.519,2451.254,So you're -- you're carrying that around as a disability.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2451.254,2463.38,"--In Fernandez-Vargas, the -- the conduct that subjected the alien to the application of this -- this procedural -- disadvantageous removal procedure -- was remaining in the United States."
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2500.503,2503.538,"It -- it can't be right that it's ""any"" future conduct."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2523.602,2533.641,"--I think that's right, Your Honor, and I think the -- the reason it wouldn't -- is reflected in some of this Court's -- in the ex post facto analysis."
2011.10-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.621,2553.538,No.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2589.394,2600.869,"I mean, I think -- the hypothetical statute I was describing I think would violate the ex post facto clause under the sort of analysis that this Court used in Smith v. Doe."
2011.10-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.869,2601.219,Okay.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2609.991,2614.345,You mean -- if you mean a parallel statute in the civil context.
2011.10-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.345,2614.945,"--Yes, yes."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2614.945,2621.616,I -- I -- I think that's the best reading of -- of Landgraf.
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2659.791,2661.242,And how do we separate those two?
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2666.996,2680.237,"I -- in the criminal context, the Court has used the analysis of Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez to figure out whether a statute is -- is imposing punishment for past conduct."
2011.10-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.016,2728.418,Even -- even if you had pleaded guilty to spousal abuse?
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2728.418,2731.77,I'm not aware of any cases--
2011.10-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.77,2732.105,Yes.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2732.105,2742.061,"--specifically addressing that question, but -- but yes, because there you have a statute that is regulating future conduct, it only applies to somebody who engages in the future conduct."
2011.10-1211,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.403,2813.174,--That's -- that's why I think the Chief Justice's question and the ambiguity of the statute are relevant.
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2848.514,2864.941,"--I think, if you are -- if you're -- if you are asking whether Congress has specifically addressed the temporal scope of the statute, we -- we -- we acknowledge under St. Cyr that it hasn't."
2011.10-1211,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.059,2871.945,"More than that -- I'm ignoring -- more than that, I'm saying what's the policy on the other side?"
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2886.272,2905.184,"--I think that the -- the policy is Congress was trying to redefine -- they were replacing the old term of entry and replacing it with a new concept of admission, they're trying to redefine a comprehensive scheme for treatment of aliens arriving at the border."
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2925.58,2930.068,Could you go over again for me your distinction of St. Cyr?
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2930.068,2932.301,"--I think it's twofold, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2946.861,2953.499,You don't argue that -- that the significance of what the individual is giving up makes a difference?
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2953.499,2962.272,"That's our second point, is that -- St. Cyr said there is a big difference between immediate deportability and the potential--"
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2962.272,2968.259,Is there a difference in terms of what they face if they don't plead guilty?
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2986.405,2988.021,--I -- I--
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2988.021,2997.36,"And I just wonder if the relative significance of what is at issue under the immigration law is something we can take into account, or if St. Cyr prohibits that?"
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2997.36,3010.436,"--No, I think it is certainly appropriate to take into account, that however -- however significant the application of Fleuti might be to aliens, it's on a different order of significance from--"
2011.10-1211,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3010.436,3023.428,"Well, Mr. Miller, the Solicitor General actually represented to us -- in the Judulang argument used that as an example, the Fleuti case, as something that people doing pleas did think about and did rely upon."
2011.10-1211,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3023.428,3039.872,"--Well, I -- I think -- we don't question that that's something that people might have -- have been aware of, and have been thinking about, but it not something that was bargained for in the plea agreement, because it's not something that is affected by the plea agreement."
2011.10-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3064.421,3066.44,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2011.10-1211,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3068.975,3070.208,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3344.087,3347.123,Do you think we have the authority to tell Congress how to draft its laws?
2011.10-1211,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3350.008,3350.758,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3350.758,3352.442,Do we send them a drafting manual?
2011.10-1211,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3362.148,3374.04,"Your Honor, this Court has said that it's important to adhere to its traditional tools of statutory construction because it's a settled background rule against which Congress legislates, which it is aware of."
2011.10-1211,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3374.04,3383.562,"You think Landgraf is clear and settled, and you are over there in Congress and you say: Boy, I know how this statute is going to come out under Landgraf."
2011.10-1211,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3383.562,3384.396,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1211,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3384.396,3385.514,Better than I am.
2011.10-1211,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3385.514,3387.031,Let me explain.
2011.10-1211,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3426.658,3436.53,"Well, that can be explained because Congress understands that, who knows whether it's going to be held to be retroactive or not; if you surely want it to apply you better say so."
2011.10-1211,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3439.415,3443.969,"--Yes, Your Honor, and a clear statement rule has that virtue, as I believe Your Honor is well aware."
2011.10-1211,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3447.754,3449.62,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
