1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.787,"We'll hear next in case No. 90-5193, Dawud Majid Mu'Min v. Virginia."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,52.487,55.389,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.938,198.51,He did allow questions as to whether they had seen media accounts?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,198.51,204.484,"Yes, he allowed one question which was, have you read anything about the case."
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.621,235.406,And what you saw was to interrogate the jurors who said they had seen something about what it was they had seen?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,235.406,241.429,"--What counsel sought to ask were several questions regarding what the jurors had seen about the case, yes."
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.31,248.583,Are there questions that... that counsel proposed to be asked in the record?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,248.583,249.484,"--Yes, they are--"
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,249.484,250.155,Well--
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,250.155,253.798,"--in the joint appendix in the first few pages, beginning at page--"
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,253.798,254.066,--All right.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,254.066,256.858,--2 are his proposed voir dire questions.
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,256.858,257.61,Fine.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,257.61,269.517,The trial judge adhered to this decision despite the fact that when the jury was attempting to be selected that 16 of the 20-some original panel called acknowledged that they had read about the case.
1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,278.733,282.286,Was that disclosed by interviewing the jurors after the trial?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,282.286,284.927,What... which ones had read about the case?
1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,284.927,285.478,Yes.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,285.478,286.697,"No, the judge said--"
1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.697,292.241,This is just based on what was... what were the responses to the questions asked by the judge on voir dire?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,292.241,293.753,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.204,311.475,Was there a motion to change venue in this case?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,311.475,312.507,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,361.119,370.416,Do you think that... is part of your claim that the publicity was so pervasive that bias should automatically be presumed?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,370.416,370.736,No.
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.11,399.296,"Well, there's not a whole lot left of Irvin after Murphy against Florida and Patton against Yount."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,399.296,406.85,"There... well, the significant thing about those cases I believe is... in Patton v. Yount I think supports Mr. Mu'Min's contention."
1990.90-5193,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.871,410.833,"Well, let's... let's talk about that precise point."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,444.765,449.459,"--No, Justice O'Connor, I don't really believe that's the rule that we seek."
1990.90-5193,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.254,485.971,"Well, of course, we have to distinguish, don't we, to some extent whether it is a proceeding arising in State court or one in Federal court."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,497.419,502.013,There is no question that this Court's supervisory power over Federal court proceedings is broader.
1990.90-5193,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.667,518.472,"Yes, but you have here a determination by the trial court judge that the jurors who were impanelled were fair and impartial."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,524.166,530.661,--He essentially... I think that the fair reading of what happened is he took their silence on faith.
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.929,548.002,"Well, well, and there wasn't... there wouldn't be anything you could do about it under... in a Federal court if they just stayed silent."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,554.507,558.978,"No, Mr. Mu'Min is not here seeking individual sequestered voir dire."
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.707,650.868,"Well, to follow that through, Mr. Blume."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,661.046,666.83,"There's certainly no question that any defense lawyer would want to know this for peremptories, but that is not the thrust of the concern."
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,675.144,678.677,"Well, so... but I mean, what specifically are you trying to develop?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,680.658,682.481,--I think it would be... there would be a number of things.
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.193,690.526,But I mean... but from your... from the point of view of the defendant?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,690.526,694.409,It would be whether the juror was qualified to serve... or if he would be excused for cause.
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.409,695.869,Excused for cause.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,695.869,697.191,I think several things could come out.
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.475,713.079,Can you... do you suggest at all of these 58 or more questions have anything to do with publicity?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,713.079,720.235,"No, I don't think Mr. Mu'Min's position here... it's actually only 4 or 5 that had to do with the media... depends on any one particular question."
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.558,736.094,"I know, but the argument... how many of these questions have to do with the fundamental issue about whether or not a juror might be biased because of publicity?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,736.094,742.138,"--There were 3 or 4, I think, in the record that he sought to ask which were denied which had to do with that particular fact."
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.138,748.832,"Well, you... this list is headed up, petitioner's proposed voir dire questions."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,748.832,752.806,"Yes, that's the entire list that he submitted... that he submitted in the case."
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.543,777.864,"Mr. Blume, what I don't see about those questions... I mean, you know, what have you... the judge... it's on pages I guess about 47 and on... of 48 and on of the... of the appendix... joint appendix."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,795.202,796.114,One of the numbers was.
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.114,797.676,--And he asked the question more than once.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,799.406,801.477,He really only went into it one time.
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.215,815.438,"Well, I see him as being rather persistent about it."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,845.307,847.598,"Well, Justice Scalia, let me give a few concrete examples--"
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,847.598,848.159,"Now, that I'd like."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,848.159,849.119,--of what I think would happen in a case.
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.119,849.569,Okay.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,849.569,853.703,"A potential juror called, what have you seen about the case... what have you read about the case?"
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.759,874.814,"Excuse me, why would he answer no to that question, but answer yes to the more general question, has anything that you've heard or read about the case so made up your mind that you couldn't put it out of your mind?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,874.814,885.062,"--Because I think that due to the nature of the prejudicial information, the way pretrial publicity prejudices someone... it's important to understand what they know."
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.399,913.689,"Well, the kind of--"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,913.689,915.382,--also may not know it.
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,915.382,923.086,"--The kind of voir dire you're talking about with Justice Scalia, Mr. Blume, would have to be sequestered voir dire."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,932.894,935.225,"Justice Rehnquist, I think the term individual--"
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.225,936.086,I'm the Chief Justice.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,936.086,937.906,"--I'm sorry, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.754,959.721,"Well, you... you would... you would have had to sequestered the individual being interrogated... the venire person being interrogated... from the rest of the potential jurors, would you not?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,959.721,962.183,I think there are a number of ways you can do it.
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.183,963.455,Can you answer my question yes or no?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,963.455,963.532,I... yes.
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.063,1022.053,"Suppose that the judge had granted these questions 32 through 41, have you heard anything... where did you get it?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1048.159,1052.513,"Well, that, you know, may or may not happen, depending on what an individual juror says."
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.174,1073.997,"Well, I know but... but to get him... unless you're going to challenge... unless you're going to... well, I suppose it is... be possible that after the juror is... is... answers these questions, he may say he... no, I am biased."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1073.997,1077.918,--That is another phenomenon which this Court has recognized and which is documented in the literature.
1990.90-5193,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.918,1079.871,"But if he says... the juror says, no, I can try the case fairly--"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1079.871,1090.009,"Then the judge would one... he would have a number of facts against which to judge the juror's assertions of impartiality and, two, the juror may change their mind."
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.852,1123.699,"--He's finally going to have to accept it one way or the other even at the end of this... of the series of questions you want to propose... the final question still is, in spite of what you've heard, can you be impartial?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1131.764,1136.827,"Yes, but then the judge has some facts, come... against which to apply the legal criteria."
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.682,1160.935,"Mr. Blume, one can presume facts."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1190.035,1193.444,"First, in this record we have affirmative evidence that the trial judge did not believe that."
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.881,1203.152,Un-huh.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1203.152,1213.139,"However, even then, assuming that the... you still would not have any way in which the juror talked about the information... that demeanor of evidence is relevant in this."
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.412,1237.272,I don't understand your first point.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1249.21,1253.684,"--No, I'm saying this particular judge said that, so we know that he didn't think--"
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.684,1264.3,"He didn't believe everybody in fact read everything, but he could have made his judgment as to whether he would believe their assertion of impartiality on the assumption that they had all read everything."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1265.532,1266.564,"--Well, we know that he didn't do it here."
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.623,1269.624,"Well, wait... why do we know he didn't do it here?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1270.906,1272.248,--It seems to me he--
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.248,1277.593,Because he doesn't believe... because he thinks the media think that they are more widely read than they in fact are.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1277.593,1278.595,--And that he said--
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.595,1287.639,"I'm saying that he assumed it, not... for purposes of his judgment... not that he believed it was true, but for purposes of whether he would believe the jury, he assumed that they had read all of the pretrial publicity."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1288.68,1297.225,"--He might do that, but again then you still would not have any idea of what... how a particular juror reacted to that."
1990.90-5193,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1375.748,1395.84,"Mr. Blume, in Turner against Murray on which you place some reliance, where the concern was the refusal or failure by the trial court to ask some voir dire questions about racial bias, the court left in place the conviction, did it not?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1395.84,1396.812,"Yes, ma'am."
1990.90-5193,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1396.812,1402.304,And yet you think that we have to overturn your client's conviction?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1402.304,1404.625,I think there are several reasons--
1990.90-5193,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1404.625,1409.009,How do you square that with what the Court did in Turner?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1409.009,1413.201,"--I think there are several reasons, Justice O'Connor, that that's true."
1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.45,1478.443,"What is the general rule that you're proposing for our adoption... that in every case where there is the potential of prejudicial publicity, there must be a sufficient voir dire to enable attorneys to make a motion to excuse for cause?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1478.443,1506.283,"The rule, as I tried to formulate it, was that if the publicity taken as a whole poses a constitutionally significant risk that the jurors may have been influenced by prejudicial, extraneous information, may have formed an opinion about the case, or may be otherwise biased or partial as to guilt, or in a capital case, as to guilt or punishment, and one or more jurors have read about the information, then some reasonable inquires must be permitted."
1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.583,1511.597,Some... wait a minute... some reasonable inquires must be permitted... by the judge?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1511.597,1512.738,--The judge would be fine.
1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1522.653,1533.261,And how do you assess reasonableness... by whether or not it would give a review in court or counsel in the case an adequate basis to determine whether or not there's cause for excusal?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1533.261,1536.093,I think first of whether it would give the judge a basis.
1990.90-5193,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.745,1573.997,"Well, why is there... I don't understand this line drawing."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1578.271,1579.29,"Yes, that--"
1990.90-5193,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.29,1580.171,It's a simple line.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1587.345,1587.796,--I think--
1990.90-5193,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.796,1591.028,--whether his wife wrote a letter to the governor about it or whatever it was.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1593.82,1598.134,"--Yes, I think under some circumstances if you can show that something about the information--"
1990.90-5193,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.134,1600.285,"Well, they said they knew something about it."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1600.285,1607.908,"--Yes, I think if you can show, though, the points... I think that if you can show that there's something prejudicial about the information that the juror might know, you would need to know, you know, what that is."
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1612.913,1615.905,And if... the U.S. Constitution requires that.
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1615.905,1631.494,"I think certainly this Court has recognized that, that the trial judge has an affirmative constitutional duty under the due process clause in the Sixth Amendment to ensure the right to a fair and impartial jury, and that under some circumstances that will require an adequate voir dire."
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.598,1639.852,"You say under some circumstances or as Justice Stevens says, under all circumstances?"

1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1664.035,1672.102,"--Well, suppose... suppose the court said that he's not going allow any inquiries as to whether or not jurors have relatives in law enforcement."

1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1691.123,1694.686,"Well, but the question is... the question is why should it just be limited to pretrial publicity?"
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1702.51,1717.391,"--That's true, but I do think that from a constitutional vantage point, this Court has recognized in numerous decisions that pervasive, prejudicial publicity has a... can affect a juror's ability to serve in a unique way."
1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1718.002,1723.254,More so than by being related to a witness or to someone whose engaged in the prosecution of the case?
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1723.254,1725.687,"--Well, those... excuse me... those questions were permitted in this case."
1990.90-5193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1725.687,1731.491,"Well, I assuming that they weren't in order to test the standard that you're proposing for our adoption."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1731.491,1740.755,There may be other circumstances which entitle constitutionally a defendant to ask certain questions.
1990.90-5193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.149,1792.119,"Well, that doesn't necessarily follow."
1990.90-5193,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1806.749,1809.15,"It is an explanation, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-5193,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.483,1831.276,"Thank you, Mr. Blume."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1838.579,1839.591,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.591,1841.952,And what... the county seat is Manassas?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1841.952,1842.913,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.065,1847.207,What's the... what's the approximate population of Prince William County?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1847.915,1856.621,"Your Honor, in 1988 at the time this case... or at the time this publicity occurred, the approximate population was 194,700, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.184,1891.418,"Not only that, but if he's heard about it from any person."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1891.418,1898.762,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that the logic of his rule extends to inquiries of that sort."
1990.90-5193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.762,1901.023,"Well, the question was asked, have you heard about it from any other persons?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1901.023,1904.516,"Yes, details of sources as well as content."
1990.90-5193,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1915.322,1917.235,What do you think the rule ought to be?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1935.878,1944.432,"--I... Your Honor, I think the rule should be that first, content questioning of the sort we're discussing here is a tool like any other."
1990.90-5193,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1957.271,1960.724,I don't understand what rule you propose we adopt.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1967.018,1985.92,"--That... the rule should be, Your Honor, that the use of content questioning is one of the many matters that is within the discretion of the trial court in conducting a voir dire, because there are a number of other objective factors which the court can consider."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1985.92,1988.792,"Well, what's the more general rule that you proceed from?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1996.018,1997.296,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1997.857,2006.724,"All right, and I take it that inquiry should be of reasonable scope to disclose likely areas of partiality."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2006.724,2007.585,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.975,2008.955,You would agree with that rule?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2008.955,2009.756,"--Yes, I would."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2014.718,2024.546,"All right, well, if that's true... if publicity is a particular problem in a particular case, then I assume that some questions must be directed toward publicity under your view?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2024.546,2030.789,I think that it is... yes.
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2037.034,2041.395,So all that we're arguing about in this case is the reasonableness of the inquiry that was made?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2041.395,2047.299,"Well, we're arguing, Your Honor... I think it's more than whether the trial court abused its discretion in this case."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2067.452,2072.357,"Well, I'll assume petitioner's counselor will say content questions are just one tool."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2082.562,2103.417,"--Well, Your Honor, what he has maintained both in his brief and in oral argument is that the error of the trial court here is in not asking any content questions and that content questions are a sine qua non of a determination that a juror can be believed when they say, I will not be affected in my judgment by the pretrial publicity."
1990.90-5193,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2103.417,2117.724,"Well, do you take the position that regardless of the pretrial publicity and the particular circumstances that the generalized questions asked by the trial judge here would always be sufficient?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2117.724,2119.366,No.
1990.90-5193,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2124.71,2129.983,So would you acknowledge that sometimes content questions must be asked?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2129.983,2141.36,"--I don't necessarily acknowledge there is any particular circumstance where this Court can draw a bright-line rule and say, here, as a matter of constitutional law, content questions are required."
1990.90-5193,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2141.36,2146.476,Do you think in some cases they would be constitutionally required?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2146.476,2149.129,"It would depend... yes, Justice O'Connor, yes."
1990.90-5193,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2150.259,2150.499,Yes.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2155.414,2171.473,--By applying the objective factors that this Court laid down in Murphy v. Florida for determining when there is reason to question the veracity or the reliability of a juror's assurances that they can be impartial.
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.412,2189.706,"Yes, but... but that doesn't really cover every possible source of information that might have been available."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2198.632,2199.333,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2199.333,2208.516,"Well, then that might put a little different cast on the thing or they might have seen a copy of the letter that the spouse wrote to the governor protesting this outrage."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2211.761,2212.219,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.461,2214.551,Let me just ask you this hypothetical.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2227.86,2231.072,"--I think that... yes, he would."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.894,2232.873,A constitutional duty?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2232.873,2233.874,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.874,2235.625,And how is that case different from this?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2235.625,2257.9,"It's different from this case because as... when... once the jury is impanelled and the jury is instructed, of course, that they are to decide the case based solely on the law and the evidence that comes in in the courtroom, then a breach of that instruction of the court... a breach of the juror's duty by receiving some other sort of information... is an exception."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.9,2260.502,"There is no other... it was there just lying on the table when they got there, and they couldn't help but see it."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2260.502,2267.637,"Well, I'm not suggesting that it... it require that the juror be guilty of wrong doing, but that's an exception to the rule."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.38,2289.611,"Well, how do you know it's more immediate?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2297.265,2297.605,--Well--
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.605,2304.541,You don't even know that... you don't know whether it was a newspaper a month ago or in a conversation with a group of friends the very day.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2304.541,2314.886,"--We... Justice Stevens, we never know necessarily everything that may affect a given individual who comes to court to sit on jury duty."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.777,2334.269,"Well, the general question... do you know anything about the defendant or the facts of the case would bring that out, and then you say what do you know."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2335.872,2347.417,--But that... bringing that out is not going to help the trial judge necessarily determine whether he believes the juror can set that aside as the juror responds--
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.417,2349.09,You don't think it would help the trial judge to know what they had read?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2349.09,2352.152,--I don't think that the trial judge needs to know that in every case.
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.152,2363.219,"Maybe he doesn't need to, but you don't think it would help him at any... you don't think there's a distinction between the wide variety of ways in which people can get information about a case and the nature of the information?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2363.219,2364.881,"It may help in some cases, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.236,2378.579,Only sometimes... I... as a constitutional rule.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2399.193,2399.573,I don't--
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.573,2402.525,Sometimes we're going to have to say the Constitution does require it.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2402.525,2407.858,"--Well, I don't think that the Court can draw a line to say when content questioning is required and when it is not."
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.858,2409.258,But there is such a line?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2410.86,2417.184,It's in the nature of a discretionary ruling that each case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances.
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.184,2418.684,Then the Constitution never requires it.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2419.845,2438.797,"Well, I think that what the Court must do in order to... to determine whether there's reason to question a juror's statement that regardless of what I read or heard in the media or on the street, I can judge this case fairly and impartially, is evaluate the other factors this Court spelled out in Murphy v. Florida."
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.418,2459.911,"Well, counsel, before the... what about a question like this."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2472.47,2479.866,"--Well, Your Honor, that... that is essentially what Mu'Min sought to ask in this case."
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.866,2482.097,Not... not those words.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2482.097,2485.54,"Not in those words, but that's the essence of what he sought to ask and--"
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2485.54,2487.821,I don't... I don't think so.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2490.532,2494.415,"--Well, we submit that that is not constitutionally required."
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2494.415,2511.045,I mean suppose somebody told this juror that I am a member of the adriscatory process of the police department and I know that that sucker is guilty.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2518.539,2530.848,"Your Honor, the... if we... if we accept a rule that that question itself must be asked in order to uncover that... that specific item of bias that Your Honor referred to--"
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.848,2531.158,Yes.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2531.158,2543.156,"--rather than the general questions which this Court asked... and by the way in... with respect to the publicity, the trial judge rephrased the question five different ways as far as whether they could impartial."
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2543.156,2546.018,My point... would you object to that phrase?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2546.018,2547.97,"Would I object to that question, Your Honor?"
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2547.97,2549.64,"Well, answer it the way I suggested it."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2549.64,2552.663,I would certainly object to it being constitutionally required.
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2597.072,2604.716,Don't the... doesn't the court instruct the jury that you can't use anything except what you hear in this courtroom?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2604.716,2606.659,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2606.659,2616.066,Doesn't the judge instruct the jury that you cannot use any information except what you hear in this courtroom?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2616.066,2616.583,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2616.583,2619.204,Doesn't he do that every time?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2619.204,2619.955,Yes.
1990.90-5193,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.955,2621.568,"Well, what's the difference of what I asked?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2625.88,2647.445,"Well, the difference is that by requiring that the court or counsel ask the juror to recount what they've heard or read or learned outside the courtroom, you assume or you imply that the juror's statement that I haven't heard anything... I don't know anything about this case that I can't put aside and be fair and impartial."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2660.183,2671.0,"Yes, but that overlooks the possibility the juror may really believe that and they may have heard exactly as Justice Marshall posits that my neighbor is a... works for the police department and he told my wife this guy is definitely guilty."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2682.247,2692.084,"--Well, I think that as a trial judge in dealing with that situation, the judge needs to consider the demeanor of the juror."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.084,2693.654,"Well, that's right."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2723.715,2730.179,"Well, of course, the jurors in this case were aware of what they had read or heard about the case."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.314,2760.687,"All that you've just said doesn't become true, however, any more if the publicity is more recent than 3 months."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2763.459,2765.231,--I didn't... I didn't mean--
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2765.231,2773.567,"Well, I'm trying to find out what other... in what other cases Virginia has to individually question the jurors in isolation from the others."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2777.991,2778.719,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.129,2779.44,No?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2786.735,2792.958,--In determining whether the court has reason to doubt a juror's assurances of impartiality.
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.958,2796.811,So we're just going to have to look at it case by case and decide whether the Constitution requires it or not?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2796.811,2797.873,"Not the Supreme Court, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.816,2806.208,And reviewing courts will review them on constitutional grounds.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2810.672,2817.478,--The nature of the publicity itself... what it reflected in the publicity.
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.844,2891.724,"I agree that the judge who's conducting the trial should consider all those things in his discretion, but as I understand your argument, a reviewing court should consider all those things in deciding whether the Constitution has been violated by not conducting individual interrogation."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2891.724,2893.026,"Well, I think--"
1990.90-5193,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2893.026,2895.477,That's the position you want us to enunciate.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2895.477,2896.689,"--Not exactly, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2938.863,2943.238,Which indicates that some specific questions are helpful to the fact finder.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2943.238,2944.678,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2998.283,3000.514,Could you answer a few brief questions about Virginia procedure?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3014.204,3017.016,"They... on the record, they were not."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3017.727,3023.47,Was anything offered in postconviction proceedings to show that they had been questioned?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3023.47,3024.81,"--This is direct appeal, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3025.761,3027.221,There have been no... there have been no postconvictions?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3027.221,3027.872,"--No, no, sir."
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3029.164,3035.289,And the other question I have is... does the trial court always ask the questions?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3035.289,3036.558,No.
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3048.246,3050.179,To ask the questions directly... not just to submit the questions?
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3050.179,3050.59,Exactly.
1990.90-5193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3051.12,3051.569,Thank you.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3051.569,3057.102,"In this case, the defense counsel asked many questions in panels of four and three and--"
1990.90-5193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.102,3062.737,"I know, but he wouldn't let them to inquire specifically what they had read or seen?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3062.737,3063.767,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-5193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.88,3066.168,He cut that off.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3066.168,3066.559,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-5193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.321,3081.127,"Especially, he didn't want... he didn't want anybody asking what the... what the juror had heard from his or her spouse."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3081.127,3088.614,"--Well, he didn't find it necessary to go into that in order to determine that he believed those jurors when they said they could be fair."
1990.90-5193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.689,3119.693,"How far do you allow him to go in that... when they said, yes, we have discussed it with somebody?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3119.693,3129.38,"--In one panel, several gentlemen indicated they discussed it with their wives when they'd read about it in the newspaper and the trial judge said, we don't need to go into the content of that."
1990.90-5193,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.855,3212.585,Is she the one who had a paper to get out?

1990.90-5193,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3248.608,3255.654,"Well, I don't think it's his position that you necessarily can never distrust... that you can never trust... a thing inherently distrustful."
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3263.571,3275.956,"--Your Honor, our position is that jurors... I think the law is well established... is that jurors are presumed to be impartial and it is incumbent upon the defense to demonstrate partiality."
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3475.171,3483.286,"Do you think it would make any difference if the juror had been in the store and seen it, but didn't think that would affect his prejudice... seen what happened?"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3483.286,3486.678,--It may be something that the trial court would want to consider--
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3486.678,3488.248,Whether or not the juror was actually a witness.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3488.248,3491.179,--in deciding whether content questioning would be desireable or would be helpful in the case.
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.179,3495.764,But not... you don't have to... you're not required to find out whether he saw the crime committed.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3495.764,3498.165,Well--
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3498.165,3500.706,That might be the source of one of these juror's information for all we know.
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3505.899,3516.378,--Certainly the trial court in this case asked the jurors if they received information about the case from the news media or--
1990.90-5193,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3516.378,3516.919,"They'd say yes, they did, but I can--"
1990.90-5193,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,3516.919,3521.02,--The trial court asked if the juror had an opinion about the case.
