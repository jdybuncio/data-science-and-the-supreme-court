1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,69.441,72.268,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.9_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.915,404.571,What's the width of the Mississippi Sound?
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,404.571,406.148,--The width of the Mississippi Sound--
1984.9_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,406.148,407.226,"From the islands, I mean, to the--"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,407.226,420.923,"--It... the distance between Isle Au Pitre, which is viewed as part of the mainland, and Cedar Point by going via Dauphin Island is less than 24 miles, just under 24 miles."
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.923,422.017,--If you don't count the islands.
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,422.017,424.031,If you don't count the islands.
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.031,424.266,Yeah.
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,425.5,427.874,Which you're not supposed to if that's a proper way of doing it.
1984.9_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,434.513,436.091,Just over 24?
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,436.091,443.587,"Just over 24 miles, which is why one has to talk about Dauphin Island, which is the key to the juridical bay argument."
1984.9_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,762.225,764.584,"Which one is that, Mr. Claiborne?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,764.584,770.862,"--The... and, of course, Dauphin Island then looks like an extension of the mainland."
1984.9_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,825.074,833.04,"Well, Mr. Claiborne, I guess there still is the question of whether it should he treated as an historic bay."
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,833.04,835.835,"Indeed, Justice O'Connor, and I turn to that."
1984.9_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,835.835,854.155,"And when... when you discuss that, I... I would be interested to know what facts led the Government to think that Long Island Sound meets that test, but Mississippi Sound does not."
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,854.155,871.742,"Let me say straight away with respect to the Long Island Sound that there was a congressionally-approved compact setting the boundary between Connecticut and New York in Long Island Sound, a thing which would be relevant only if those were waters of those two states."
1984.9_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.58,896.123,"Well, I guess during the Civil War, a fort was constructed or started to be constructed to do the same thing?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,896.123,903.386,"A... as Your Honor rightly says, a fort was more or less constructed."
1984.9_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,952.6,962.487,"Well, didn't... didn't your-didn't the SG take a contrary position about Mississippi Sound at one point and concede that it was inland waters?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,962.487,971.717,"--I freely confess that like all others, Solicitors General had fallen into error in the past."
1984.9_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,971.717,981.355,"Well, but didn't this Court as well treat it as inland waters and apply the law of the thalweg to some question?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,981.355,995.974,"Well that, Your Honor, here refers to the decision of this Court in litigation to which the United States was not a party entitled Louisiana v. Mississippi, the decision of this Court in Volume 202 of United States Reports decided in 1906."
1984.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1026.227,1029.913,"Well, that... that might be true as to res judicata, but it's certainly not true as stare decisis."
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1037.052,1049.468,"--Your Honor is of course correct, but this Court laid Louisiana v. Mississippi aside as though it were not a relevant precedent in the first California case."
1984.9_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1129.248,1130.701,But not to open sea.
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1130.701,1135.199,"--Not to the open sea, but the Court seemed to say to territorial waters."
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.522,1196.346,When... when did the SG concede or purport to concede that this was in inland waters?
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1196.346,1200.907,"On two occasions in the Louisiana case, the Solicitor--"
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.907,1201.095,Yes.
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1202.61,1217.136,"--Well, it was simply a matter of distinguishing a way from the Louisiana context what had been thrown up as an example of inland waters form islands... that is, Mississippi Sound."
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.566,1236.346,"So he... he... he... he misread our prior... the Court's prior decisions, too."
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1236.346,1237.237,Indeed.
1984.9_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1372.274,1375.46,"Was there any occasion to do so, Mr. Claiborne?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1375.46,1391.455,"The record is surprisingly silent with respect to that, but we can suppose that this being a well-known fishing area, there might indeed have been foreign fishing vessels that would have wished to come into the area."
1984.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.455,1396.328,"Mr. Claiborne, how deep is the water in the bay?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1396.328,1418.677,"Well, the channel that separates Dauphin Island from the mainland, though somewhat artificially maintained, but artificially maintained for well over 150 years, if I remember is some 12 feet in depth."
1984.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.44,1426.315,That's the Intercoastal Waterway.
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1426.315,1427.174,Intercoastal Waterway.
1984.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.452,1437.967,And the balance of the sound is how deep?
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1437.967,1447.822,"Oh, anywhere from 6 to and perhaps even shallower portions up to 10 feet, I think I'm correct in saying."
1984.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.849,1461.051,"Of course, it might have some-might explain why there's not as much foreign shipping as there might otherwise be."
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1461.051,1461.254,Indeed.
1984.9_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1487.477,1495.287,"Well, but if the water is so shallow that it isn't used, and there's no evidence of such use by foreign vessels, what would you look to?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1495.287,1525.885,"Well, I would say, Justice O'Connor, that the burden is on the states to show, and indeed as this Court has said, to show beyond doubt when the United states disclaims the area as its own historic waters that history, contrary to the rules of international law, make this area the internal waters of the United States--"
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.885,1535.879,"When did the United States first indicate this position, that it disclaimed any... disclaimed these waters as inland waters?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1535.879,1539.706,"--It first did so, Justice White, in 1970."
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.706,1543.549,"And what was the occasion for that, the starting of this lawsuit?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1543.549,1544.58,No.
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.378,1597.293,"By the way, what was the basis for say... saying that the waters inside that line from Isle Au Pitre to the coast... what was the basis for treating the waters to the west of that as inland waters?"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1597.293,1612.552,"Well, they meet all the tests provided one takes Isle Au Pitre as an extension of the mainland, and it is of the same sort of deltaic formation as the rest of those waters which were involved in this Court's decision in... in Louisiana v. Mississippi--"
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.552,1615.597,"But... but they weren't adjudicated, these particular islands."
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1615.988,1618.143,"--Well, Isle Au Pitre was mentioned."
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.797,1629.015,--But this was... is... were the waters treated as inland waters because they were... they were a juridical bay?
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1629.015,1629.452,"Oh, yes."
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.452,1630.202,Not a historic bay.
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1630.202,1631.124,Not a history bay.
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.331,1666.156,"But Isle Au Pitre... you have to... all those islands, that whole chain of islands has to be treated as a part of the mainland."
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1666.156,1672.561,"--Yes, but as far as the whole chain, if one means the Chandeleur Sound islands--"
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.561,1674.403,"Well, the ones... the ones--"
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1674.403,1674.794,--West--
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1674.794,1677.652,--The ones southwest of Isle Au Pitre--
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1677.652,1690.63,"--Yes, but that is a determination this Court made with respect to all but perhaps Isle Au Pitre in Louisiana v. Mississippi and which is almost unavoidable because it's nothing but a criss-cross."
1984.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.613,1698.816,"--For your case it shows too much, that's true."
1984.9_orig,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1698.816,1707.296,"--But the map submitted by the states perhaps gives a more accurate impression, because they've used a darker color."
1984.9_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.998,1719.042,Mr. Bruce.
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1719.042,1723.134,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.121,2085.989,"Mr. Bruce, what does the record show with respect to commercial shipping destined or... to or from Pascagoula or to or from Biloxi or to or from Gulfport?"
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2090.721,2092.018,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1984.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.868,2130.503,"But my question is: Looking at the defendant's map for oral argument which you've passed out, how does shipping move to and from Gulfport, I mean with respect to those various islands and that sort of thing?"
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2130.503,2139.234,"Your Honor, with regard to Gulfport, the ships would come in a dredged channel made for that purpose for entering the harbor works at Gulfport."
1984.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2143.2,2145.372,Between Cat... Cat Island and Ship Island.
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2145.372,2146.262,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.383,2160.991,How does a ship coming from somewhere else in the Gulf of Mexico approach Pascagoula?
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2160.991,2165.677,"Your Honor, the channel there would be between Petit Bois Island and Horn Island."
1984.9_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.393,2183.872,"Does... does... does a ship headed from Mobile... is there anything in the record about a ship headed from Mobile either to Gulfport or Pascagoula, would... would that go seaward of Dauphin Island?"
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2183.872,2185.606,"Your Honor, it would have to."
1984.9_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2200.398,2202.271,"Mr. Bruce, what's the depths of those channels?"
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2202.271,2207.848,"Your Honor, the channels vary from time to time, and I can't give you a specific idea."
1984.9_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2226.636,2228.136,So not very big vessels--
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2228.136,2228.917,"No, Your Honor."
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.698,2283.382,--I take it you support the reason the Special Easter gave for treating Dauphin Island as part of the mainland.
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2283.382,2284.992,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.152,2313.042,Because?
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2316.478,2317.759,"--Well, Your Honor, one of the things they pointed out--"
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.759,2323.928,"The reason that the... the same reason that the Special Master gave, that they were... abutted inland waters?"
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2323.928,2325.99,"--Your Honor, that is part of it."
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.328,2386.013,"Well, that's... you can't find that obvious stated in any of our cases, can you?"
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2386.013,2388.247,"--Well, Your Honor, I think--"
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.247,2388.981,Can you or not?
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2388.981,2390.043,--there is some indication.
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.043,2391.496,Can you give me a citation?
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2391.496,2392.854,"Well, Your Honor, so far as--"
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.854,2397.884,To support the... that particular holding of the Special Master?
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2399.525,2400.322,--Not exactly.
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2403.461,2403.883,"Well, can you cite any?"
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2403.883,2411.879,"--Well, I think there is something very relevant, and that is this Court's consideration of Article 11 in the 1969 Louisiana decision."
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.773,2450.944,Where does the baseline intersect Dauphin Island?
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2452.739,2455.676,--The baseline would go from Mobile Point to the east end of Dauphin Island.
1984.9_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.676,2457.785,Why does it include all of Dauphin Island then?
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2457.785,2464.063,"Well, Your Honor, the Dauphin Island would be an integral part of the mainland or a part of the baseline."
1984.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2470.966,2476.979,What is the approximate distance between Dauphin Island and Mobile Point?
1984.9_orig,1,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2476.979,2478.823,"2.68 miles, Your Honor."
1984.9_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2592.448,2608.74,Mr. Cohen.
1984.9_orig,2,17540,benjamin_cohen,,2608.74,2613.596,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.295,2630.81,Does it make any different to the states which it might be?
1984.9_orig,2,17540,benjamin_cohen,,2630.81,2634.854,Whether under juridical idea?
1984.9_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2695.595,2701.921,How does the evidence satisfy the continuity requirement for historic status?
1984.9_orig,2,17540,benjamin_cohen,,2701.921,2714.853,"First, as you correctly pointed out earlier, this Court's opinion in Louisiana v. Mississippi, 1905, found that Mississippi Sound was internal waters."
1984.9_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2714.853,2724.489,"Well, how does the evidence introduced in this proceeding support the continuous exercise of dominion over the Sound?"
1984.9_orig,2,17540,benjamin_cohen,,2724.489,2731.315,Once... the Master looked at pre-admission history and post-admission history.
1984.9_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.565,3121.689,"Well, when did Norway make that request of the United States?"
1984.9_orig,2,17540,benjamin_cohen,,3121.689,3124.016,"I think it was in 1949, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.9_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3179.228,3180.087,Very well.
1984.9_orig,2,17540,benjamin_cohen,,3180.087,3180.618,Thank you.
1984.9_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3180.618,3181.821,"Thank you, gentlemen."
