1998.97-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.417,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-1121, the City of Chicago v. Jesus Morales."
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,10.619,19.746,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,83.689,85.151,Just one question.
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,89.014,101.961,"The general order that govern enforcement, 92 4... it is in the petition appendix... contains quite explicit instructions and demanding standards for making determinations of gang membership and, of course, even respondents do not challenge--"
1998.97-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,101.961,105.914,And it takes some experience and expertise to know this?
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,105.914,106.244,--It does.
1998.97-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,121.364,126.978,"Well then, how does the person who's not a member of the gang know that he is doing something unlawful?"
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,126.978,139.036,"Well, interestingly, Justice Kennedy, the critical point here is that, on the question of fair notice, as Your Honor's question points out, it is not unlawful to loiter in the City of Chicago."
1998.97-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.822,156.127,"Does the police tell the person who is not a gang member, this is a gang member and therefore you must disperse?"
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,156.628,158.4,--The ordinance does not provide for that?
1998.97-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.4,159.579,"Well, how does the person know?"
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,162.351,170.568,"Well, what the person has... what the police are told, what the police do is, they give an order in terms of common parlance to disperse."
1998.97-1121,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,184.849,186.88,"Well, maybe they should and maybe not."
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,196.697,201.549,"--Of course, the way to test the order is in court, and it is a defense--"
1998.97-1121,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,201.549,209.323,"Well, regardless of whether one wants to test it or not, if the police do not have the predicate for the order the individual doesn't have to move."
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,209.323,212.116,"--Well, the traffic laws provide a good example."
1998.97-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.994,235.981,"Mr. Rosenthal, are you saying, then, that if the law... simply read, it would be much easier if a police officer gives you a command to disperse and you don't obey you've committed an offense."
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,235.981,242.696,"Justice Ginsburg, we think that that is what this law reads for purposes of fair notice."
1998.97-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,242.977,248.489,"And you think that that's... if the Chicago ordinance said nothing but that, you think it would be constitutional?"
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,248.489,250.27,--We think it would supply fair notice.
1998.97-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,252.343,252.904,What other problems?
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,260.308,266.081,"Well, that ordinance is so broad it might reach picketing demonstrations, activity protected by the First Amendment."
1998.97-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,274.736,280.65,"--Suppose the hypothetical were changed so that it says, the police give you a lawful order to disperse."
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,280.65,284.464,"Well, again, I... we think that that would be--"
1998.97-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,284.464,286.995,Which means that they would have to have good reason.
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,286.995,289.687,"--That... and we think this case is no different, Justice--"
1998.97-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,289.687,290.188,And suppose--
1998.97-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.188,290.919,--You think that would be okay.
1998.97-1121,0,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,290.919,293.64,"--We do, at least on the question of fair notice."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1496.993,1507.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.715,1521.887,"Mr. Grossman, the question of overbreadth isn't before us, is it?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1524.96,1527.471,"--It did not, Your Honor, but we have preserved that issue."
1998.97-1121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1531.344,1536.009,"Well, you've preserved it what, as an alternate ground for affirmance?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1536.009,1536.968,"Yes, we have, Your Honor."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.295,1580.849,"But what issue, whether you can prohibit loitering?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1580.849,1597.199,"Whether a police officer will have sufficient guidance under a law that prohibits nothing more than mere loitering, in this case defined as having no apparent purpose, when that officer seeks to apply it in the field."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.703,1649.274,"This is admittedly a prophylactic measure, and maybe sometimes it will pick up situations that were not dangerous, but how do you distinguish it from, as far as police discretion is concerned, nighttime road blockades to check for drunken drivers?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1649.274,1650.285,--Well--
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.285,1663.223,"Now, that's a situation where you're stopping somebody's freedom to move instead of somebody's freedom to stand still, but it's entirely up to the policeman at the blockade which car he's going to stop and which car he isn't going to stop."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1670.379,1671.58,--Well--
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.58,1675.853,And isn't that entirely up to the discretion of the police officer to say it's okay?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1675.853,1680.108,"--No, I think that it matters if it is a regul... if it is regulatory in nature."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.003,1689.474,Regulatory in nature?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1691.624,1692.643,--I think the situs--
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.643,1692.954,--Wow.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1692.954,1694.366,"--If I could go on, I don't think--"
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.366,1698.267,Protecting against drunken drivers is better than protecting against criminals?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1698.267,1698.537,--No.
1998.97-1121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.154,1722.725,That's not a question of vagueness.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1731.96,1735.002,"Your Honor, I respectfully disagree."
1998.97-1121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.532,1775.614,How do you know that?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1784.62,1788.213,--The Court can freely examine the charging documents in this case that are of record.
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.631,1801.3,"Mr. Grossman, the section reads this way."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1824.788,1827.79,"--Well, Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with you."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.5,1830.071,You disagree with the words of the statute?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1830.071,1861.263,"--I disagree with how you're parsing the statute, and I also disagree with how it is that the city views this statute in reality, because whenever the city talks about whether or not this ordinance inappropriately sweeps within its prosecution scope persons who it thinks shouldn't be prosecuted or is embarrassed to say should be prosecuted, or fears that if it does agree that they would be subject to prosecution that it would violate even minimal notions of rationality, it says they are free to go to court and prove they weren't loitering."
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1861.263,1862.191,But Mr.--
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1862.191,1864.024,"In fact, Mr. Rosenthal did it as he stood up here."
1998.97-1121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.247,1870.349,"--That's in the ordinance as an affirmative defense, isn't it?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1870.349,1871.06,"--No, it is not."
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1881.899,1893.607,"Well, Mr. Grossman, wouldn't you take the position if you were defending someone that the complaint certainly should charge the predicate of the order, that is, loitering in the company of a gang member?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1893.607,1894.585,Absolutely.
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1894.585,1895.145,All right.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1895.145,1896.327,And the charging documents do do that.
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1896.327,1897.307,"That's what they do, so--"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1897.307,1897.757,Absolutely.
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1897.757,1903.521,"--So in fact they charge both the loitering, the identity of the gang member, and the refusal to disperse."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1903.521,1905.043,"They do, and they make a distinction."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.727,1929.39,Has anybody been charged who did not disobey a police order to disperse?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1929.39,1931.172,There is no one--
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.172,1937.297,Is there anybody who has been charged at all in Chicago who did not disobey a police order to disperse?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1937.297,1945.471,--There is no one of the 66 defendants who has a charging document that does not recite verbatim--
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.471,1946.592,Are you answering my question--
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1946.592,1947.382,--Yes--
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.382,1948.043,--or some other question?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1948.043,1951.395,"--Your Honor, I am answering your question within my capability."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.381,1959.363,Do you know of any--
1998.97-1121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.363,1961.694,"--He asked a question, Mr. Grossman."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1963.103,1966.076,"Mr. Morales testifies... excuse me, Your Honor."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.002,1979.114,I'm asking whether he was charged.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1979.114,1980.466,"--He was charged that way, yes, sir."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.466,1986.989,"And as far as you know, everyone who has been charged has been charged with disobeying the order to disperse?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1986.989,1989.891,All 66 of the defendants before the Court have been so charged.
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.891,1993.815,And you don't know of anybody else who has been charged who hasn't been charged with failing to disobey the order?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1993.815,1994.496,"I do not, Your Honor."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.496,1994.816,Okay.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,1994.816,2008.574,"I'd like to reiterate that there is nothing in this record, the evidentiary record before the city council, that spoke to nongang members at all."
1998.97-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.418,2033.451,"So what, in your opinion, could... look, what could Chicago do?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2095.574,2108.112,"--I think that the Illinois supreme court, as many other courts... in fact, we cite People v. Caswell, which is a California supreme court, which reviews in some detail the way that the States have treated this matter."
1998.97-1121,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.777,2157.584,"I suppose the city's answer to that is that it's unenforceable because we have to have a nongang member neighborhood resident testify, and they won't testify, and the police come by and the police see nothing."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2159.477,2167.802,"--Well, but the other States have been living with intent to... loitering with intent to deal drugs, loitering with intent to engage in prostitution, and there are--"
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.802,2168.912,What other--
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2168.912,2172.295,--massive numbers of prosecutions under those laws.
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.422,2201.164,--If they will accommodate by engaging in criminal conduct while the police officer is looking at them.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2201.164,2204.617,"--No, I think that people have to... I think that there are different... well, first of all they do do that."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.617,2208.33,"As soon as they see a police car in the area they just hang out, and that's the problem."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2208.33,2209.139,"Well, they do--"
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.139,2214.602,Their mere presence hanging out terrorizes the neighborhood and prevents the people of the neighborhood from using the streets.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2214.602,2217.484,"--Well, they do in some places and they don't in some places."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.026,2238.039,Some of the problem is not just dealing drugs.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2259.932,2271.011,"They have a right to try to stop that activity through various means, not necessarily a broadly worded loitering ordinance that includes within its sweep nongang members."
1998.97-1121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2271.011,2273.662,How about if they just cut out the nongang members?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2279.656,2284.389,"Apparent purpose, no apparent purpose is still too vague for a police officer to operate under."
1998.97-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2296.347,2300.41,So that... so then your argument has very little to do with the fact that nongang members are subject to this ordinance.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2300.41,2301.272,--Excuse me?
1998.97-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2301.272,2306.204,"So then you're arguing it has very little to do with the fact that nongang member are subject to this ordinance, then."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2306.204,2309.145,"No, it... I think that those are both vices of this ordinance."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.448,2352.959,Don't the police rules handle that?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2358.683,2359.484,"--Well, first of all--"
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.484,2361.474,"I mean, you're making a facial challenge here."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2361.474,2362.065,--I am--
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.065,2366.828,It seems to me Chicago has tried to implement it in a way that will only identify what you call the hot spots.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2366.828,2368.03,"--I am, Your Honor."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.619,2440.117,"But if you say you can designate thousands of areas under it, you're denying the fact that the ordinance can reasonably be limited in our review of it by what has been in fact provided in the police regulation implementing the ordinance."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2440.117,2441.008,It does--
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.008,2446.132,"In theory, you could designate millions of places, but they say, we will only designate those places that are hot spots."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2446.132,2449.484,--Thousands and thousands have been designated.
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.484,2453.267,"Well, I don't care, maybe there are thousands... do you know that there are not thousands and thousands of hot spots?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2453.267,2468.137,"If there are thousands and thousands of hot spots, Your Honor, then what we're talking about is a broad omnibus ordinance that stretches across the entire city, and we're no longer talking about a place, an ordinance that's focused, and limited, and applied with surgical precision."
1998.97-1121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2468.137,2474.101,"This order is not currently enforced because of the Illinois supreme court decision, is that right?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2474.101,2477.761,It has not been enforced for 3 years because of the Illinois appellate court decision.
1998.97-1121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.237,2484.166,Has there been a substitute?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2487.519,2493.804,"No, although the city continues to do sweeps, and we have in our brief before the Court indicated--"
1998.97-1121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.804,2495.817,"Sweeps under what statute, if this ordinance is no good?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2495.817,2511.315,"--I think that they continue to use a disorderly conduct ordinance which requires, of course, a threat to... an imminent breach of peace, a threat to... an immediate threat to the public safety, and that's an individualized determination that's made about a particular person on the street."
1998.97-1121,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.315,2521.933,May I ask if... you suggested earlier that it would be the same problem if there were... nongang members were not included in the ordinance.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2537.952,2539.174,I think that--
1998.97-1121,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.174,2541.055,--if they loiter without apparent purpose.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2541.055,2541.696,--I think--
1998.97-1121,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.696,2542.156,Would that be valid?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2542.156,2551.893,"--I think that at some point a city could make a judgment that a congregation of a certain size posed a de facto obstruction of the street, for example."
1998.97-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2559.938,2569.986,"Well, if it's a de facto obstruction of the street that has nothing to do with gang membership, then your ordinance would say, any group of 10 or more, no matter, without referencing... Justice Stevens was asking you about gang members."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2569.986,2577.82,--I... the way this ordinance is phrased is suspected gang members.
1998.97-1121,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.448,2597.764,"No, I'm assuming that the... you still have the same loitering condition, and the same definition of loitering, no apparent purpose, but you're... you have two major changes."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2610.782,2613.203,"No, I would still have problems with the vagueness of the ordinance."
1998.97-1121,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.203,2616.135,"And what would be the defect, the principal defect in that ordinance?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2616.135,2622.61,"The principal defect would still be unbounded discretion of a police officer, because he has to make the judgment, or she has to make the judgment about no apparent purpose."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.704,2677.557,Protesting in front of an embassy is a First Amendment activity.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2687.034,2692.516,--The Boos... the Boos ordinance did not speak at all about First Amendment activity.
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.328,2703.113,It was obviously directed at protests in front of embassies that were intending to make First Amendment points.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2703.113,2708.285,"Well, I can't agree or disagree with you about the legislative intent on that particular ordinance."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.285,2713.741,"You disagree that it was treated as a First Amendment case, as a First Amendment problem by the Court, and is this case a First Amendment case?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2713.741,2723.937,"I agree that the Court considered it problematic without too much definition, and that it must have been concerned about First Amendment rights, but I don't think that First Amendment rights are not present in this case."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.478,2761.523,The issue as to whether it's a First Amendment case is whether the ordinance is directed at First Amendment activities.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2770.82,2783.628,"--Well, Your Honor, this is a regulation of the public street and in Kolender, the last time this Court saw a pure loitering ordinance, it said that it implicated freedom of movement, and that it had the potential to arbitrarily suppress First Amendment freedom."
1998.97-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.144,2808.566,We do give... I'm thinking of Justice Stevens' hypothetical statute.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2819.763,2820.734,Excuse me?
1998.97-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.734,2823.325,"They, the statute says, can't use the street to stand around in."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2848.071,2855.816,Because when you are attempting to regulate the street there are a multitude of interests and activities which the citizen possesses.
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2902.419,2902.588,All right.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2939.233,2941.717,"No, I think that it is not, Your Honor."
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2942.505,2942.785,Why?
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2942.785,2943.266,--Because--
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2943.266,2945.567,We don't have the purpose problem here.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2945.567,2956.556,--We have always allowed people to continue to assemble on the streets in public fora so long as their immediate behavior does not threaten public safety.
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2957.645,2958.035,Okay.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2961.659,2962.41,"--There is not, Your Honor."
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2962.41,2963.96,--So we're into substantive due process.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2963.96,2965.171,We are.
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.995,2972.726,So you say there is a constitutional right to loiter.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2972.726,2973.647,"No, I do not."
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.308,2976.549,I thought that's what your point was.
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,2976.549,2977.079,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2995.07,2996.792,"Sure, but it's also extraordinarily vague."
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,3027.114,3034.317,"Well, I do believe that that's true, and that you can't prophylactically ban that activity under a criminal statute."
1998.97-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3078.889,3085.582,"Well, what is specifically the activity that you're concerned about in the congregation of the five gang members, speech?"
1998.97-1121,1,27147,harvey_grossman,,3087.834,3088.104,--Yes.
1998.97-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3100.242,3102.593,"They're probably complaining about the police, which is--"
1998.97-1121,2,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,3246.642,3257.772,"United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois estimates there are 100,000 gang members in the City of Chicago."
1998.97-1121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3358.87,3368.597,"Mr. Rosenthal, would you explain why their purpose wouldn't be accomplished as well if the only target of the arrest and the crime were the suspected gang member?"
1998.97-1121,2,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,3368.597,3380.445,"--By ordering everyone to move on, it is far simpler, rather than sorting through a crowd and telling each individual who must stay and who... who may stay and who must go."
1998.97-1121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3404.24,3417.97,And I thought you also assumed that in the ordinary case there wouldn't be terrorized local residents of the housing projects hanging out on the corner with the gang members.
1998.97-1121,2,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,3417.97,3418.82,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3418.82,3421.414,Sort of a birds of a feather flock together principle.
1998.97-1121,2,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,3421.414,3432.703,"Justice Scalia, it is so interesting that the respondents have chosen to dwell in the realm of hypotheticals on a facial challenge, after there were tens of thousands of applications of this ordinance."
1998.97-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3448.842,3453.927,"I thought he said that about 33 out of the 100 or something, a lot of them are not gang members who are being--"
1998.97-1121,2,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,3453.927,3459.611,--The police did not have... were not able to establish a reasonable belief that they were gang members.
1998.97-1121,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3508.796,3510.729,"Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal."
1998.97-1121,2,35039,lawrence_rosenthal,,3510.729,3511.861,"--and for that reason, we ask that judgment be reversed."
1998.97-1121,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3512.251,3513.601,The case is submitted.
