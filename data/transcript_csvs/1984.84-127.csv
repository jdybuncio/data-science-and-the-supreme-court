1984.84-127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.904,We will hear arguments next in Richardson-Merrell against Koller.
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,35.154,36.506,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,484.744,490.648,"Well, how do the Courts of Appeals stack up on this other than in this case?"
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,490.648,498.503,The Courts of Appeals prior to Flanagan followed the Fifth Circuit in Duncan against Merrill Lynch and all said--
1984.84-127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.503,500.153,They said that was appealable.
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,500.153,504.157,--They said it was appealable because of the difficulty of showing prejudice after the appeal.
1984.84-127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.302,530.475,"The Circuit just didn't lie down and say Flanagan, they thought Flanagan was right or wrong?"
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,530.475,561.677,I don't know whether they went to right or wrong but they... Judge Albert Rubin said it should be followed and said that inasmuch as this Court has looked at orders denying disqualification in criminal cases and orders granting disqualification in criminal cases and orders denying disqualification in civil cases that it would be anomalous to say that this should be a different rule for an order granting disqualification.
1984.84-127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.677,562.61,How about your old Circuit?
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,562.61,576.169,The Second Circuit... The first case that came up they said this raises a question that may require re-evaluation of our earlier holding.
1984.84-127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.375,587.077,"So, the Second agrees with this case?"
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,587.077,590.513,It agrees only in the sense that it won't move until it is told.
1984.84-127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,598.369,598.969,I see.
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,598.969,600.352,And it preceeded Koller.
1984.84-127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,600.352,601.821,Mr. Walsh--
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,601.821,602.354,Yes.
1984.84-127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,602.354,612.177,"--I guess you agree that it is difficult to establish or examine the question of prejudice after the fact, after judgment."
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,612.177,622.917,"With great respect, Justice O'Connor, it is a problem that comes with many kinds of error besides this."
1984.84-127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.76,651.837,"Well, suppose we were to agree with you that an interlocutory appeal is not proper, but then you get to the end of the line and you have this issue setting there."
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,665.311,672.667,That could be a feasible... certainly a rational position to reach.
1984.84-127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.904,680.887,I wanted to ask you that.
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,687.843,698.282,--What it seemed to say... What it says actually... I refer to the paragraph beginning at the bottom of the 31A.
1984.84-127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,737.257,741.578,That would just go to whether an interlocutory appeal is proper.
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,741.578,743.144,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.141,844.045,Did it hold that any of the findings were clearly erroneous?
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,844.045,847.763,"It did not, Justice Rehnquist, it did not."
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.766,906.616,"Mr. Walsh, could I interrupt you for a moment?"
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,906.616,907.066,Yes.
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.066,916.49,"Because in addition to the factual problem of this kind of a factual case, I was not entirely clear as to the legal standards that the district judge applied."
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,925.513,926.596,Not his opponent's.
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.308,975.446,Is there any precedent for disqualifying a lawyer for that reason?
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,975.446,982.7,"Well, to the extent that this is obstruction of justice there are precedents and they are in a footnote in our brief."
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.791,997.793,And the remedy was disqualification of the lawyer.
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,998.76,1000.394,"--Disqualification, yes."
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.394,1002.679,--a disciplinary matter or something like that.
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1009.25,1017.106,It started about 40 years ago with about a 100-year history in conflicts and a 40-year history of discreet acts of misconduct.
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1017.106,1017.723,I see.
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1017.723,1034.666,"Usually it has been used with discreet acts of misconduct whether our co-counsel and whether out-of-town lawyers where the forum only has one contact with the lawyer in question and, therefore, less of a reason for suggesting going to the Bar Association or something like that."
1984.84-127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.666,1041.421,"Mr. Walsh, I am somewhat loathed to ask you this question, but I think it is bound to be in the back of one's mind."
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1052.46,1057.181,"I wouldn't think that, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.181,1060.133,"If it is, I am glad I went on the Bench."
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1061.833,1070.088,"--Well, I won't say it has gotten any better, but this was unusual."
1984.84-127,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1072.273,1077.444,By that you mean both sides?
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1077.444,1097.508,"I don't know about the other side, but I think that they also were reacting to an unusual situation, but the question was where one side tried to preserve the witness involiate for the Court, the other one was trying to destroy the usefulness of her testimony."
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.508,1105.494,"One other question going to the legal rules, do you think it is clear that a different standard should apply to out-of-town counsel and a regular member of the Bar?"
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1105.494,1106.529,We don't urge that.
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.529,1107.229,You don't?
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1107.229,1113.6,As to the standard of misconduct we suggest it is best to keep that the same.
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.729,1140.101,"In terms of a remedy for misconduct, would you say that it would not be appropriate to disqualify a lawyer unless it were also appropriate to impose some kind of discipline?"
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1140.101,1144.819,"Yes, even in a conflict case."
1984.84-127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.921,1150.223,"And, in this case did the judge refer the matter to anybody for disciplinary purposes?"
1984.84-127,0,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,1150.223,1150.84,--It did not.
1984.84-127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1361.912,1364.781,Mr. Gottesman?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1364.781,1368.149,"Thank you, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-127,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1438.042,1445.881,Do you suggest that that judge did not taken into account prevailing standards of the profession?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1445.881,1454.284,"Well, Your Honor, the Court expressly said that she was not making the assessment of whether these counsel had violated the prevailing standards."
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1583.269,1587.74,I thought there were something like eight lawyers representing the client.
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1587.74,1591.209,"--There are eight lawyers who have entered appearances in this case, Your Honor."
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1601.831,1606.702,How many lawyers were representing the client otherwise?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1606.702,1618.942,"--Well, what the record clearly shows, and this is not contradicted, is that in terms of preparation of the case on the merits for trial Mr. Butler and Mr. Allis were regarded as the principal trial counsel."
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.423,1722.594,How much other options does a court have when you are dealing with people admitted pro hac vice?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1729.516,1730.432,"California, that is right."
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.432,1734.984,That the District Court should refer the matter to the California Bar for discipline?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1734.984,1742.24,"The District Court... If these people had done a wrong, and they had not, but if they done a wrong, the District Court would have had the power of contempt over them."
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.24,1751.596,"If the District Court excerised the power of contempt... I have seen enough cases come up here... then the yelling that, no, they should have just disqualified them."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1751.596,1753.297,"No, we wouldn't be yelling that at all."
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.297,1755.047,It is a second guessing operation.
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1755.047,1762.587,"Well, there is a difference, Your Honor, and this is what all the courts have said, you have to decide what is the purpose of the disqualification?"
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.667,1803.564,"So, if it were perfectly outrageous conduct on the part of an attorney at one stage of the case, and yet he was obviously totally penitent and said I won't do it again, the District Court would be obligated not to disqualify him, even though he would have violated 15 canons at the time he committed the outrageous conduct."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1803.564,1811.051,"If the District Court could not find that his continued participation in that case would imperil the integrity of the trial, that is correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.24,1821.626,What is your authority for your view of disqualification?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1821.626,1826.811,It is now... It started with the Second Circuit's decision in Nyquist.
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1831.565,1834.249,Was the Nyquist decision based on conflict?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1834.249,1837.385,That was what was involved in that case.
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.385,1851.378,"Well, it seems to me one could take... Could quite easily distinguish between situations where there have been conflicts and where one gets a certain feeling of gamesmanship in efforts to disqualify which don't relate to court conduct at all."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1859.215,1871.375,"Well, the question of whether gamesmanship was at work here, Your Honor, is one that I want to get to because it goes to the whole appealability issue and the need for an interlocutory appeal."
1984.84-127,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.336,1892.372,"You haven't mentioned the word ""deterrence""."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1894.824,1903.144,"Because there are punitive sanctions that can be used against lawyers who misbehave, there are deterrents."
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2017.602,2027.541,"Well, Mr. Gottesman, I assume that Mr. Allis wittingly or unwittingly was going to become a witness in the trial it sounds like."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2027.541,2030.26,"Well, he could only possibly be a witness--"
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2030.26,2033.612,And certainly would have been disqualified on that ground alone.
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2033.612,2036.497,"--Well, the concurring opinion raised that possibility."
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2063.666,2069.052,"Well, in any event, it wasn't decided so he was a potential witness at trial, I guess."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2069.052,2076.141,"Well, at some point the Petitioner was going to have to announce a final decision on that point."
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2092.401,2100.055,Do you think an order of disqualification because someone is a prospective witness is immediately appealable?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2100.055,2115.397,"That uniquely may not meet the second of the three factors because then the question of whether that judgment is correct, that is to say whether the lawyer truly was needed as a witness, can't be made until the trial."
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2124.186,2126.622,Do you think that was correct in the Sixth Circuit case?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2126.622,2130.859,--I think there is a respectable argument to be made for that position.
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.44,2260.225,Are you at some point going to discuss Mr. Butler's conduct?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2260.225,2261.994,"I would like to, Your Honor, yes."
1984.84-127,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2295.716,2299.101,You said what his motive was not.
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2302.453,2304.489,"Well, he said what his motive was, Your Honor."
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.495,2343.63,Did the District Court credit his version of his motive?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2343.63,2345.414,"--No, the District Court did not."
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2363.225,2366.229,Why is it a First Amendment case?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2366.229,2374.549,--Because the question of whether he can be punished for having made a statement to the press about an issue of paramount public importance.
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.493,2400.466,Are you saying there is a First Amendment right after a trial court rules that important evidence in the case is not admissible to send the evidence to the newspapers?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2400.466,2412.258,--I am saying that if that evidence is relevant to a paramount public issue which far transcends this lawsuit as the safety of Bendectin does and... this is very important.
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.623,2452.335,"You would apply that to say a prosecutor who views what he thinks is the erroneous application of the exclusionary rule as an issue far transcending just the guilt of this defendant so he decides to send the person's confession, which the court has suppressed, to the newspapers?"
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2452.335,2468.695,"Well, in the context of a highly visible trial where the whole community is reading the paper about that and in this case where a jury hasn't been sworn yet, there is a substantial risk, a substantial and imminent risk that that disclosure will prevent the selection of a jury."
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.543,2497.697,Because the jurors would be asked if they had read this article?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2497.697,2498.647,Sure.
1984.84-127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.899,2515.659,"Then you can say with respect to any disclosure to a newspaper of evidence which a trial court has ordered suppressed in an earlier hearing, it won't prejudice the selection of the jury because if they have read about it in the newspaper they will be excluded from the jury."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2518.259,2527.55,"--No, because there are some issues of such importance that you can reasonably assume that the vast majority are going to have read and it is going to make it very hard to find a jury that hasn't seen this."
1984.84-127,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2541.374,2542.29,"Does that appear in the record, Mr. Gottesman?"
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2542.29,2543.124,--Pardon?
1984.84-127,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2543.124,2545.742,Does that circumstance appear in the record?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2545.742,2546.526,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2589.355,2602.079,"Mr. Gottesman, do you think it is possible that a defendant in a criminal case has an even stronger interest in being represented by his counsel than in a civil case?"
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2602.079,2603.53,--Sure.
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2610.434,2617.588,But that didn't prevent the court from finding that an order of disqualification of counsel was not immediately appealable?
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2617.588,2620.438,--It did not and I want to explain why that doesn't apply here.
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2844.481,2851.151,"What if the Court would apply, as I think the Court of Appeals did here, a presumption of prejudice?"
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2851.151,2854.353,"--The Court here implied no presumption, Your Honor."
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2870.213,2872.23,"Well, I think I read it differently."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2878.051,2884.538,"--Well, if the Court said there will be an automatic reversal, it would affect--"
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2884.538,2886.824,"No, just a presumption of prejudice."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2886.824,2887.69,--I guess I don't know--
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2887.69,2889.609,"--that affects the burden of proof, of course."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2889.609,2890.192,--Right.
1984.84-127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3025.461,3028.93,"Of course, part of that cuts against the Flanagan rationale."
1984.84-127,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3028.93,3031.865,--It cuts against Flanagan for a very important reason.
1984.84-127,2,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,3157.78,3161.132,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3163.767,3165.036,I have one question.
1984.84-127,2,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,3169.238,3169.988,Yes.
1984.84-127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3169.988,3193.286,"Based on something you said in your opening argument, would you think that there would be an absence of prejudice regardless of who has the burden if your client could show in the subsequent proceedings here that there were other counsel equally well recognized in the profession as those who were disqualified who would take the work... substitute their same rate of pay and all the rest."
1984.84-127,2,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,3195.138,3197.404,"Justice Stevens, we think it would."
1984.84-127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.898,3217.734,"But then does it not follow... If that is an adequate disproof of prejudice, you will never have prejudice in any of these cases because the Bar is big enough."
1984.84-127,2,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,3219.853,3224.288,"--Let me give an example that occurred to me, Mr. Justice, where I think there could be a problem."
1984.84-127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.45,3297.854,"It seems to me you are saying if the case is so weak that you don't care who represents the plaintiff, why, you would not worry about it."
1984.84-127,2,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,3297.854,3299.038,--I don't think that.
1984.84-127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.038,3300.071,You could file a motion in that case.
1984.84-127,2,35227,lawrence_e_walsh,,3300.071,3303.007,I don't mean to minimize the case at all.
1984.84-127,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3305.69,3307.209,"Gentlemen, the case is submitted."
