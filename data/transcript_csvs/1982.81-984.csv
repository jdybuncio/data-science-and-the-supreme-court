1982.81-984,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.028,We will hear arguments next in First National City Bank against Banco de Cuba.
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,74.22,87.028,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case was begun by a Cuban government instrumentality in February, 1961."
1982.81-984,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.319,263.894,"Mr. Harfield, what does that connote in the practice of the Southern District, approval for filing by the court?"
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,263.894,284.353,"Well, this was an application by counsel for a party to substitute another party, another person as the party plaintiff, and the Court in this case on stipulation, on the agreement of the defendant, said it is so ordered."
1982.81-984,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,299.77,305.752,Are you suggesting that certain inferences can be drawn as a result of that?
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,305.752,308.125,"Yes, I think so, Your Honor."
1982.81-984,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.125,322.088,"Mr. Harfield, you don't contend that Bancec is somehow unable to proceed in the litigation because it was dissolved, I take it."
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,322.088,328.196,"Well, I am troubled by that, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-984,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.349,336.973,Did you take that position below?
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,336.973,351.061,"--We simply took the position that there was an identity between Bancec or, if you like, between Bancec's ghost and the Republic of Cuba, the Cuban government."
1982.81-984,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.061,356.402,"But you didn't argue that because Bancec was dissolved, it couldn't proceed?"
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,356.402,361.025,"No, we did not argue that the act of dissolution was what did it."
1982.81-984,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.071,384.344,"Did you argue below that regardless of Bancec's situation, that you could assert the counterclaim in any event because the Cuban government or Banco Nacional had appeared?"
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,384.344,394.637,We did not put it on the ground of an appearance by the Cuban government or Banco Nacional.
1982.81-984,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.333,427.25,"Well, I guess the courts below didn't really resolve the question about whether the assets had gone to Banco Nacional at one time or had gone to the Cuban government."
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,435.498,439.261,"There is... I think it was decided, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-984,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,516.308,519.744,"--Well, is the question, who is the real party in interest?"
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,519.744,523.134,"Well, I think that's one way of formulating it."
1982.81-984,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,548.748,556.073,"I am puzzled by why you distinguish that from real party in interest, which is common in all kinds of civil litigation."
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,556.073,558.854,"Yes, and I am perfectly content to accept that as the real party in interest."
1982.81-984,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,562.915,568.241,And your position is that the government of Cuba is the real party in interest.
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,568.241,578.063,"Is the real party in interest and has been throughout, and in that context, if I may, I would like to point out that... one other fact here."
1982.81-984,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.327,624.577,Mr. Harfield--
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,624.577,632.636,"--is that the task of the trial judge, the factfinding task that he had was to find out who is pushing the claim and who is pushing the counterclaim."
1982.81-984,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.636,638.024,"--I was just going to make that inquiry, and I gather that Judge Grant did find pretty much in your favor--"
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,638.024,638.868,"Yes, he did."
1982.81-984,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.868,644.913,"--on that point, but the Court of Appeals certainly did not affirm his finding, did it?"
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,648.099,648.739,So did I.
1982.81-984,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.956,652.753,Except that you lost.
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,652.753,654.44,"--Yes, I knew that."
1982.81-984,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,719.43,723.208,"If it was not a commercial transaction, how was it characterized by--"
1982.81-984,0,27192,henry_harfield,,723.208,725.958,The basis for the counterclaim?
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1105.881,1132.73,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States believes that the issue presented by this case is whether or not an instrumentality of a foreign state could bring suit in United States court should be insulated from a counterclaim properly asserted against the state on the sole basis that that state instrumentality did not play a key role in the wrongful conduct of the state."
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.487,1272.939,"That may be, but what is the source of the law on it?"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1272.939,1275.641,The source of the law.
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.968,1282.92,"Well, what is the... you say courts around the world find it necessary to determine it."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1289.964,1303.037,"--Well, the rule... generally courts who have examined the alter ego question in the context of state-owned entities have focused on two particular factors, the extent of government control and whether or not--"
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.037,1305.692,"--Well, that may be, but where do they get those rules?"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1307.722,1308.363,"--Well, it's--"
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1308.363,1309.3,"--or is it federal law, or what?"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1312.455,1316.64,--We are suggesting that the United States should apply federal law in the circumstances of this case.
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.64,1317.718,The law of the forum.
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1317.718,1319.592,"Yes, as in this--"
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.592,1320.279,Not international law.
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1320.279,1320.795,--No.
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.57,1340.787,You don't think international law makes the law of the forum state conclusive?
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1340.787,1341.443,"--No, it doesn't."
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.244,1372.275,What error... what error did the Court of Appeals make?
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1376.43,1378.538,Simply overly narrowly confining the inquiry.
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.593,1440.841,"So the only issue here is sort of a mixed question of law and fact, of whether on all the facts--"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1440.841,1441.762,"No, it is a legal question."
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.774,1451.18,"--Well, I know, but you said it was primarily a factual question."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1451.18,1455.116,"--Well, the alter ego determination is a factual question."
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.116,1457.099,"Well, that's what's involved here, isn't it?"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1457.099,1467.268,"Yes, but what the Court of Appeals has said is that the alter ego test, the legal test for alter ego is just one factor: did the state entity play a key role in the wrongful conduct of the state."
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.607,1480.794,And what... Did the Court of Appeals say what the source of the test would be?
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1486.041,1486.916,I haven't the foggiest idea.
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.916,1488.586,"--Did they think it was a matter of federal law, or--"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1488.586,1489.274,They didn't state.
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.94,1514.734,"--Mr. Wilkins, may I ask you, looking at this case at the time the litigation started, the very day it started, what was the governmental function in your view that Bancec was performing?"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1514.734,1519.731,You have to look at Bancec... Bancec's overall operation at the time.
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1556.481,1564.104,Can you give me an example of a government-owned corporation in Cuba that could be performing a non-governmental function under your view of the test?
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1564.104,1565.244,--I am not certain.
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.599,1575.036,"No, I am just asking your view."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1583.502,1585.813,"--Well, it... that--"
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.813,1586.844,Or are they all governmental?
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1586.844,1590.546,"--Well, that is a very difficult inquiry, and if you read--"
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.546,1593.779,But how do we get... you say that is the key inquiry in this case.
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1594.747,1595.435,--It is a key inquiry.
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.568,1619.94,"--You can't give me an example, I take it, of a Cuban government-owned inquiry that would pass your test... enterprise that would pass your test."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1619.94,1620.44,--I am not familiar.
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.642,1624.188,"I don't mean by name, but just by concept."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1625.672,1639.433,"Well, for example, a very recent case in the E Congresso De Partedel case in the House of Lords again, that... the House of Lords determined that Mambisa, a Cuban shipping company, was separate enough from the state."
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.707,1656.019,"--Now, how does that differ from this export company?"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1656.019,1667.609,"Well, the factors that the Court of Appeals... that the House of Lords examined in the Congresso case and this case are very diverse."
1982.81-984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.675,1698.97,"Well, let me give you a hypothetical."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1710.185,1710.966,--I'm not certain.
1982.81-984,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.218,1762.54,"Mr. Wilkins, the asset control regulations were developed to try to ensure that all creditors in this country of Cuba were treated fairly, I suppose, in any final settlement that the United States would make with Cuba."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1775.298,1775.736,No.
1982.81-984,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1829.105,1852.283,"And would it be your position that in all countries in which a corporation is owned and managed by a foreign government, that we should treat it the same way as this case and hold that company liable for any illegal acts of the government?"
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1852.283,1864.169,"We suggest that on a properly formulated alter ego test, any entity, whether it be a private entity or a state-owned entity could be subject to the same test."
1982.81-984,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1901.561,1907.168,Is your position here inconsistent with the government's position with respect to the Iranian claims?
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1907.168,1909.104,"--Certainly not, Justice Blackmun."
1982.81-984,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1909.901,1911.338,Would you expand on that?
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1911.338,1916.913,--I am not certain that I understand exactly what your concern is.
1982.81-984,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1918.554,1926.505,"Well, as I understand it, if you prevail here, if Citibank does, there is a set off."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1931.658,1932.315,--Yes.
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.559,1987.87,Your position is that this is really the Cuban government.
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1987.87,1988.558,Exactly.
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.558,1994.82,"And if it were clear and admitted, there would be no question what the outcome of this case should be."
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1994.82,1995.117,Exactly.
1982.81-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.117,1998.975,Wholly aside from there being a fund.
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1998.975,2000.193,True.
1982.81-984,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2000.193,2006.878,Except that there you run into the act of state doctrine.
1982.81-984,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2006.878,2018.03,"Yes, but it is very clear... it may not be terribly clear what the rationale is, but it is very clear what the result is here, but in the context of this case there is no act of state problem."
1982.81-984,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2018.03,2022.496,Mr. Krinsky.
1982.81-984,2,36138,michael_krinsky,,2022.496,2031.37,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin by addressing Mr. Justice White's question about the source of law."
1982.81-984,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.682,2108.618,"Are you speaking now of this corporation, or are you generalizing?"
1982.81-984,2,36138,michael_krinsky,,2108.618,2116.319,"This is the points in common between this corporation and most of the government corporations of the world, particularly the third world."
1982.81-984,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.178,2328.187,"Mr. Krinsky, I take it that the argument you are just making is not in your view... you can accept all of Judge Brant's findings and still say that they don't bear on it because you would apply a different legal test than he did."
1982.81-984,2,36138,michael_krinsky,,2328.187,2328.514,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1982.81-984,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.99,2401.189,"Mr. Krinsky, what corporations of the United States, analogous government corporations, would benefit in other nations from the application of the rule of international law that you describe?"
1982.81-984,2,36138,michael_krinsky,,2401.189,2415.229,"Your Honor, the District Court stated that this corporation was closest to, in his view, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation."
1982.81-984,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2415.229,2416.573,Is that still extant?
1982.81-984,2,36138,michael_krinsky,,2416.573,2420.508,"No, Your Honor, it is not, but it was for a long time, and of course--"
1982.81-984,3,27192,henry_harfield,,3144.434,3159.585,"Just this, that I think that what has been indicated by the respondent's argument is that the case must be either looked at on the facts of the case where we have findings or it must be looked at in terms of the generalities."
1982.81-984,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3178.407,3179.532,"Thank you, gentlemen."
