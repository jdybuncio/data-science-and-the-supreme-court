2009.08-1301,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.199,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1301, Carr v. United States."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,8.197,15.321,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress uses ordinary words in the statute, those words should get their ordinary meaning."
2009.08-1301,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,35.232,44.4,"Mr. Rothfeld, I wondered if I could ask you about three interrelated points concerning your textual argument."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,245.487,250.327,"--Well, I'll try to keep straight each of the parts of the question."
2009.08-1301,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,363.56,365.276,"Mr. Rothfeld, would you clarify one thing?"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,377.54,378.835,--We are not questioning that.
2009.08-1301,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,388.189,397.746,"Is that -- that's pretty unusual, isn't it, to have Congress say it's up to the Attorney General whether their laws apply prospectively or retroactively or--"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,397.746,400.585,It -- it certainly is unusual.
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.506,417.532,"Well, it's not as though he was authorized to make something a crime which wasn't -- which wasn't a crime."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,417.532,420.0,"--That's absolutely right, Justice Scalia, and I think--"
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.0,421.891,He was authorized to say you have to register.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,421.891,438.508,"--It's -- it's actually quite helpful to our argument in this case that Congress was aware of how to confer retroactive authority on the Attorney General for some things, which it did, the designation of pre-SORNA sex offenses as triggering the registration requirement."
2009.08-1301,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,438.508,448.723,"I thought that the sequence argument that the government was making was that the events have to occur in this sequence: the conviction, the interstate travel, and the failure to register."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,448.723,450.611,That is their argument.
2009.08-1301,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,463.858,464.825,"Well, they might be wrong on that."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,480.93,487.285,"--We -- we agree, but I think -- we do not agree, obviously, with the government's understanding of the first element of the offense."
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.314,499.093,"You -- you're saying it has to take place not just after the offense, but after the obligation to register."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,499.093,500.263,That's absolutely right.
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.263,502.451,Which is what the statute says.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,502.451,503.325,Which is what the statute says.
2009.08-1301,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,511.85,519.863,"Well, but they might be wrong that the sequence -- that the way these set out -- are set out in the statute dictates a temporal sequence--"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,519.863,520.253,They--
2009.08-1301,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,520.253,540.511,"--that you can argue that the temporal sequence that's necessary -- conviction, travel, failure to register -- follows from the purpose of this provision, which is to catch people who, after having committing a sex offense and being convicted of a sex offense in State A, move to State B."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,547.647,554.21,"--Well, we of course don't agree with the government on everything, but we do agree that they are right about the sequence, for a number of reasons."
2009.08-1301,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,592.816,594.189,"Well, that makes -- that makes a lot of sense."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,609.12,611.947,--I think sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.429,626.052,"Well, assuming it does depend on the purpose of the statute, what would the purpose -- it wouldn't cover his transportation as an infant."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,627.752,628.8,No.
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.065,630.142,Or 15 years old?
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,630.142,630.563,--Looking for--
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.563,635.235,Or is it 20 years before the offense or 25 years before the offense?
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,636.608,643.03,"--You would have to make it up, but if one were to depart from the text of the statute, which says"
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.305,757.085,But which the States didn't enact.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,757.085,760.925,--And States have generally -- States have not complied with SORNA.
2009.08-1301,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,775.042,775.997,"Well, let's compare two cases."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,798.221,803.968,"I think Congress had in mind -- as I say, it was addressing a particular problem."
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,875.563,878.293,"Well, what is the basic purpose of this statute?"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,900.376,906.482,I think that the purpose was generally to encourage registration of sex offenders.
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,919.355,927.473,"No, I mean, if they are just trying to get people to register in general, and they are not particularly worried about travel, then they are using this travel as a kind of jurisdictional hook."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,936.157,938.407,"Well, two points--"
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.407,942.093,I -- I have a hard time seeing just what they're aiming at.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,942.093,956.603,"--Well, it -- it's -- to -- to be honest, I think it's not entirely clear that Congress had anything specific in mind beyond a reaction to the prior regime in which there were inconsistent approaches being taken by the States."
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,956.603,958.697,"Basically, at the time they passed this--"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,958.697,959.492,At the time they--
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,959.492,961.976,--most States didn't require registration.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,961.976,968.395,"--All States did require registration of some sort or another, but they had different registration systems and different requirements in their registration systems."
2009.08-1301,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1024.572,1026.088,That begs the question.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1053.545,1055.467,"Well, that's -- that's right."
2009.08-1301,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.404,1115.364,"The problem is that the people who had traveled previously and failed to register would no longer be subject to any -- either any registration process or presumably any punishment either, because they were no longer in the State in which the conviction occurred, so any change in that statute wouldn't affect them."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1115.364,1125.955,"Well, that -- under the -- the new regime that Congress anticipated would -- would be put in place, every State would enact, would have in place a -- a criminal punishment."
2009.08-1301,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.794,1142.525,And do -- do they generally require registration even if the offense was committed before the registration act was passed in the State?
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1142.525,1143.542,"Yes, they do."
2009.08-1301,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1148.895,1153.365,"So what you're saying is that, even under your interpretation, there is going to be registration in at least one State?"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1153.365,1154.597,Absolutely.
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.597,1160.001,"Would you say this at the moment -- you may not know, but I think it would be helpful."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1166.608,1167.905,Yes.
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1167.905,1168.233,Yes.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1168.81,1169.185,All States--
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.185,1188.179,"Now, thinking of that -- thinking of that set of registration acts in virtually every State, did most of those or none of them or a few of them or how many made it required that a person register who had committed a crime, a sex crime, in a different State and had moved to that State?"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1190.254,1192.644,--I -- I believe that universally--
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.644,1194.363,Universally.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1194.363,1197.815,--they did not distinguish based on the location of where the sex offense took place.
2009.08-1301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.377,1198.579,All right.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1219.056,1230.52,"--Well, the -- the various registration -- State registration laws that existed pre-SORNA, that -- all the States had registration requirements, but -- but they differed in a number of respects."
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.353,1257.103,"And would that be the case after SORNA, that some States would have less extensive coverage than others?"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1257.103,1271.547,"--It is possible after SORNA that -- that States will enact criminal regimes that don't -- that don't mirror the SORNA -- the SORNA definition, but--"
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.547,1284.497,"Well, unless that could be the case, then I don't see what is achieved by -- why you worry about somebody moving to another State in order to evade the registration."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1284.497,1286.759,"--Well, SORNA--"
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.759,1293.536,"I mean, if the new State requires you to register just as much as the old one, what are you worried about?"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1293.536,1309.902,"--Well, under the SORNA regime if the States all implemented SORNA as Congress anticipated that they would, if they all enacted these statutes, I think that there wouldn't be -- the only concern would be that people would simply fail to register, they would then disappear--"
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.902,1310.854,Fail to register entirely?
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1310.854,1311.65,--altogether.
2009.08-1301,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1326.203,1359.081,"Isn't the concern that the State of conviction knows that an individual who has been convicted of a sex offense has been released from custody and, if that person is a resident of the State, presumably knows that the person is likely to still be in the State, but if the person moves to another State, the State to which the person moves doesn't know that a sex offender has moved into the State, and that's the reason for the Federal law that imposes a penalty for failing to register in the new State after having traveled across interstate lines?"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1359.081,1359.362,--That's -- that's -- that's quite right.
2009.08-1301,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1407.997,1439.75,"I -- I think that I remain a little bit confused by the question one of my colleagues answered, and I'm not sure if this last answer by you is helping me understand it, which is if SORNA now -- if every State is supposed to pass legislation which requires sex offenders who have been convicted elsewhere and moved to their State to register, why do you -- I think that's what you -- that you answered affirmatively for Justice Kennedy, correct?"
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1451.075,1451.855,That -- that's right.
2009.08-1301,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1451.855,1452.806,All right.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1465.034,1467.191,Those States could do that.
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.836,1499.803,Perhaps Congress--
2009.08-1301,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1499.803,1508.878,Do you think part of it is there was a -- SORNA requires a lot more information than was required under the State statutes?
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1508.878,1509.252,--Yes.
2009.08-1301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.874,1528.149,--It's conceivable also that Congress was -- was not confident that the States would be as active in prosecuting violations as the Federal Government would be.
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1528.149,1532.18,"--That -- that is -- that's possible, too, and again that is a prospective focus."
2009.08-1301,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.174,1545.954,"--Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1301,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1545.954,1546.94,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1301,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.94,1553.235,Mr. Gannon.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1553.235,1564.792,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's offense under 18 U.S.C. 2250(a) occurred when he failed to register as required by SORNA well after SORNA was enacted."
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.478,1613.489,"Mr. -- Mr. Carr, was in violation of the law the instant it was passed, right?"
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1613.489,1627.578,"We don't think he was in violation of the law the instant it was passed for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause; under cases like Tranbarger and Samuels, we think that he did have a reasonable period of time to comply with the new obligation."
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1672.342,1673.078,What's -- an obvious question.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1676.373,1682.245,"Well, it's going to depend upon the facts of the individual case, as the Tranbarger Court recognized."
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1714.667,1718.964,So -- but the reasonable time question doesn't come up in your -- in your hypothetical.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1718.964,1719.573,--In -- in--
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.573,1722.43,"First because he's in the hospital and he has got a defense there, so--"
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1722.43,1740.988,"--Well, that -- that's right, and -- but I -- but we do think that it is a background principle in -- in all of these cases that if somebody is literally unable to avoid the criminal consequences of their pre-enactment conduct, that that would raise the concerns that the Ex Post Facto Clause is intended to solve."
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.986,1749.341,"--But no -- but as far as a reasonable time goes, nobody's literally incapable of doing it the same day the law passed."
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1749.341,1750.249,"--Well, I--"
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1750.249,1752.402,Unless they meet one of the other exceptions.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1752.402,1759.121,"--Well, this -- I mean, this is -- that's -- we -- we think that somebody does need a reasonable time to come into compliance."
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.39,1779.971,Where -- where -- where?
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1781.718,1784.67,This is in 2250(a)(2)(A).
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.273,1795.995,I see.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1796.556,1802.662,--(A) applies to sex offenders who -- who are sex offenders by virtue of a conviction under Federal or tribal law.
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.223,1805.329,--And they don't have to travel in interstate commerce.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1805.329,1808.387,--They don't have to travel in interstate commerce because of the (A) and (B).
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.373,1809.732,Right.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1809.732,1815.028,--is then knowingly fail to register or update a registration as required by SORNA in paragraph (3).
2009.08-1301,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1835.675,1838.954,Do you happen to know what Indiana law provided at the time?
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1847.826,1849.807,It -- it was a few days at the time.
2009.08-1301,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1873.27,1881.811,"Well, should the reasonable time -- should the period under SORNA, which isn't specified by statute, be the same as the period under the law of the State into which the person moves?"
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1881.811,1886.682,"Well, the -- the period is specified under -- under SORNA with -- when, once the--"
2009.08-1301,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1887.98,1888.386,Right.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1888.386,1889.68,--regime comes into effect.
2009.08-1301,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1889.68,1890.055,Right.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1890.055,1901.177,"And it does require in -- in 16913(c), that somebody update the registration after a change in residence within 3 business days of -- of coming to the new residence."
2009.08-1301,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1920.198,1920.623,Can you clarify--
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.623,1921.184,How long ago--
2009.08-1301,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1921.184,1925.165,"--Can you clarify what you mean by ""the statute comes into effect""?"
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1932.474,1936.24,"--Well, that's -- that's partly true, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1301,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1975.785,1976.846,But that would be what their--
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1976.846,1977.064,--his -- his address--
2009.08-1301,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1977.064,1978.452,--what their old law was.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1987.573,1998.756,"--It's true that, especially before SORNA was enacted, that that's all the State was doing, if the State has amended its law since then, and Indiana did update its law in 2006."
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2029.529,2038.805,"What -- what do you do with Mr. Rothfeld's hypothetical about someone who travels in interstate commerce as a young child and, 20 years later, is covered by SORNA?"
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2038.805,2053.674,"--Well, we think that that's not covered under the sequencing argument that we've made, which -- which partakes of the purpose of the statute that Justice Alito was talking about and -- and the order in which the relevant acts occur."
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2086.675,2086.878,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2096.124,2096.467,--Is--
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2096.467,2103.31,--is because it's -- you have to require under SORNA before the travel?
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2103.31,2112.042,"--It's -- no, it's -- you have to have been convicted of a sex offense, because that -- that's what brings you within the category of persons--"
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.042,2112.853,--I don't know where you get that from.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2144.825,2147.227,"--Well, I don't think that we are making it up, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.227,2148.619,"Well, what text do you base it on?"
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2165.298,2174.719,"Well, we get that from the facts -- from the context here, from the anomaly that would be created, the structural anomaly about the differential treatment between Federal and State sex offenders."
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2204.145,2207.376,So your answer to Justice Scalia is that you don't get it from the language?
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2209.954,2210.5,We get it from the context.
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.777,2221.712,"Well, what about going back to the purpose?"
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2277.592,2280.306,"--Well, there is something like that, but that's not all that's going on."
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.166,2282.572,Yes.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2282.572,2288.586,"--that you're talking about, Justice Breyer, it specifically says that sex offenders who fail to comply will face felony criminal prosecution."
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.349,2293.176,"Yes, but that's -- that's true of everybody whether they have moved or not moved."
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2293.176,2293.8,"--Well, it's--"
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.8,2305.67,"That is, what I'm -- the reason I brought up the other is because if this is just a jurisdictional hook, I can see why Congress might be trying to get as many people as they want to register."
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2325.863,2338.141,"--Well, I think that Congress did pass the statute for -- for multiple reasons in -- in order to encourage there to be a more effective, comprehensive nationwide registration scheme."
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.186,2373.514,Okay.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2375.682,2380.573,"Well, it -- it first of all imposes a Federal registration requirement."
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.838,2381.29,Okay.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2382.682,2384.054,--in 16913--
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.054,2385.286,--He's afraid of the Feds.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2390.999,2397.059,--It's -- it's not just that he's afraid of the Feds when they can come with prosecutorial powers under section 2250.
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.521,2410.96,Okay.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2435.059,2444.289,"--Well, that -- that's true, but we already know that this is true without regard to post-SORNA travel for persons who have Federal sex offense convictions."
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.289,2447.35,The only reason I bring it up is if this is a very close case.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2464.251,2484.177,"Well, I think, to the extent that the committee report identified 100,000 missing sex offenders as the most significant enforcement problem in the sex offender context, 10 years after every single State and the Federal government had passed a panoply of sex offender registration requirements, shows that they were concerned about persons who had fallen off the sex offender registry rolls."
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.064,2513.806,"No, but -- but it doesn't, because if you haven't been -- if you are convicted of a Federal offense, you are automatically in, but if you are convicted of a State offense, you're in only if you travel in interstate commerce after that offense."
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2520.181,2521.788,--There is going to be some inconsistency--
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.788,2522.225,Exactly.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2522.225,2526.225,"--but we think that it's dramatically lessened, and it's important in this context to--"
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.225,2528.222,That -- that's a much less powerful point.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2531.487,2538.951,"--There is, but the vast majority of the 100,000 sex offenders that were missing were people who would have been convicted under State sex offenses."
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.463,2553.008,"Have you been able to find -- when in doubt about the purpose, let's turn to the language."
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2564.239,2572.97,--I think that lots of jurisdictional hooks referring to travel and interstate commerce are phrased in present tense.
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.535,2606.034,Do you find anywhere where they're both phrased in present tense and it was pretty clear that Congress intended to catch activity that was -- at least where the jurisdictional part took place before the statute took effect?
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2608.814,2614.028,--I -- I'm not aware of -- of a provision that's -- that's phrased like that--
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2614.028,2615.716,I tried to--
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2615.716,2617.312,--where that -- where those are the only things that are at issue.
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2617.312,2619.246,--I tried to find one and -- and couldn't.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2636.723,2638.958,That's -- that's true.
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.965,2663.337,"Yes, where -- where it means prior travel, it says so, use of a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce."
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2665.865,2673.863,"--In those cases in context, I think it was easiest to say that when it has traveled vis-à-vis the act that was in question there."
2009.08-1301,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2838.297,2851.133,--understand some of the delay Congress may have in passing a law with specifics about how things are done.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2876.921,2884.416,"Well, I -- I think here that there -- the question of notice and knowledge has not been an issue because it's--"
2009.08-1301,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2884.416,2884.79,I -- I--
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2884.79,2890.569,--And I think that's -- this -- one of the things you said is the States may not have a place to register.
2009.08-1301,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2896.862,2897.33,--Absolutely--
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2897.33,2897.615,And -- and--
2009.08-1301,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2897.615,2899.502,--but they don't have a SORNA place to register.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2899.502,2900.77,"--Well, it's the same place."
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.875,3100.593,One last one.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3112.042,3116.274,--That's -- that's true under Section 42 U.S.C. 16913.
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3116.274,3116.992,Yes.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3116.992,3117.491,That's true.
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3120.146,3130.344,But it's a crime -- it's a crime under the section we're talking about only if you are both the person who had to register and you didn't and you moved?
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3130.344,3132.111,--If you fall within (2)(B)--
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.111,3132.158,Yes.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3132.454,3133.608,--the person who -- who has to--
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3133.608,3136.545,Everybody in the State has to register if they meet that definition?
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3136.545,3138.436,--In order to -- to meet the--
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3138.436,3138.982,Moved or not?
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3138.982,3141.669,"--To meet the registration requirement of 16913, that's true."
2009.08-1301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3142.168,3142.574,Okay.
2009.08-1301,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3142.574,3152.443,"And -- and -- and, obviously, that -- that makes sense in terms of implementing the scheme, that if somebody registers beforehand, it makes it much easier to catch them once they move afterwards."
2009.08-1301,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3152.443,3155.177,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.676,3163.72,"Mr. Rothfeld, I hate to eat up any of your rebuttal time, but this is sort of by way of unfinished business."
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3183.101,3191.707,"The -- those all appear in the civil registration provision, not in the criminal provision."
2009.08-1301,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3207.527,3223.492,"But all of those provisions refer now -- as a result of the Attorney General's determination that pre-SORNA convictions qualify, all of those provisions use the present tense to refer to activities that can have taken place in the past."
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3223.492,3224.833,--But at the time that Congress--
2009.08-1301,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3224.833,3226.503,This very -- this very statute.
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3227.189,3228.347,--That is correct.
2009.08-1301,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3247.836,3253.444,"No, but your main argument is that ""travels"" is in the present tense, and that means present and future."
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3263.598,3268.032,"--Well, the -- that's -- I'm not sure that I would say that's our principal argument."
2009.08-1301,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3308.311,3318.196,"Well, Mr. Gannon may have made an argument that's not helpful to his position, but you can accept that the first provision means exactly what it says: ""is required to register""."
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3336.703,3341.2,"An earlier version said ""travels thereafter""."
2009.08-1301,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3362.207,3369.191,"It doesn't if that results from the aim of the statute, rather than the order in which those elements are set out in the statute."
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3369.191,3373.905,"But I'd suggest, Justice Alito, that requires an extensive rewriting of the language of the statute."
2009.08-1301,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3373.905,3375.153,It doesn't.
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3378.776,3380.058,And one has to -- one would have to--
2009.08-1301,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3380.058,3385.444,"And, moreover, there's a statutory limitation, because after a certain period of years, you don't have to register anymore."
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3392.35,3393.442,--But one has to--
2009.08-1301,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3393.442,3396.206,"And then you wouldn't have committed the crime as an infant, so there we are."
2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3399.564,3408.354,"--Well, and even so, one has to read into that limitation as to where -- why it is that there is that limit on -- on the--"
2009.08-1301,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3408.354,3412.932,"You have to change the language ""is required to register"" to ""has committed a""--"

2009.08-1301,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3432.052,3440.092,"Well, I'd suggest that that's a peculiar reading of the term ""is required to register"", that, as written, it seems to me as a present -- tense requirement."
2009.08-1301,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3455.698,3457.913,"Thank you, counsel."
