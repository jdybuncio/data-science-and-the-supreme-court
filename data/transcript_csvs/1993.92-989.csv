1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.507,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-989, Tennessee v. Donald Ray Middlebrooks."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,11.09,14.562,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,53.906,58.311,Have you ever held that proportionality review is constitutionally required?
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,58.311,66.134,"--Your Honor, the comparative proportionality review I think this Court has said is not constitutionally required."
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,74.609,76.422,So you're just describing the Tennessee--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,76.422,76.642,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.642,77.02,--system.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,77.02,77.421,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.457,155.774,"Do you have any idea, General Burson, of the percentage of first degree murders that are not subject to the capital sentencing procedure?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,157.784,159.106,"No, Justice Kennedy--"
1993.92-989,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.106,159.444,--or can you get them to me?
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,159.444,163.207,"--and we've tried to kind of run those down, and they're very elusive."
1993.92-989,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.49,186.091,But you can't give us any idea of the percentage of the total universe of first degree murders that the excluded portion consists of?
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,186.091,186.602,No.
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,186.602,196.029,"General Burson, how are you defining first degree murder if simple intent murder comes within first degree murder?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,196.029,199.862,"No, simple intent murder does not come within first degree murder."
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.842,202.945,I thought you said a moment ago that it did.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,202.945,206.705,"--Oh, no, it's excluded by definition from first degree murder."
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,216.672,221.856,"What do you mean by simple intent murder, just to... what is that?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,221.856,223.688,"Well, I mean that--"
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,223.688,225.077,No intent to kill?
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,225.077,232.393,"--Well, that you have an intent... no, that you have an intent to kill as distinguished from premeditated, deliberate, and wilful."
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,256.908,261.572,"In other words, the murders that are eligible are all premeditated murders and all felony murders."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,261.572,262.604,That's correct.
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,262.604,272.909,"And in the felony murder category, as the statute was at the time of this crime, it did not require intent to kill, is that right?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,272.909,274.131,That's correct.
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.683,298.396,"Well, again, you say circumstances of first degree murder that don't embrace all--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,298.396,298.776,--Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,298.776,299.337,--first degree murder.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,303.12,312.406,"Premeditated and deliberate murders are not embraced and also, today, child abuse murders are not embraced by the felony murder aggravating circumstance."
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.406,313.494,"Oh, by the felony murder--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,313.494,313.815,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,316.307,316.797,--But--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,323.984,324.204,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,324.204,328.365,--to be defined as a first degree murder is potentially eligible--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,328.365,328.906,"Yes, Justice--"
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,328.906,329.667,--for the death penalty.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,329.667,339.274,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the... each... if you're convicted of the offense of first degree murder, the jury has two choices, life or death."
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,339.772,342.474,So there's no narrowing at that stage.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,358.065,358.906,--That's correct.
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.906,362.047,"Is that entirely correct, General Burson?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,368.422,377.639,"Yes, and... this... Mr. Chief Justice, the point I'm trying to make, basically what Tennessee does, it describes first degree murder, which are premeditated murders, felony murders."
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,386.972,391.106,"So it would be perfectly proper to say that there is some narrowing there, would there not?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,391.106,391.637,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,391.637,392.608,All right.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,408.447,412.661,It narrows the class of first degree murders.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,412.661,419.715,"Yes, once it is... once the murder is classified as a felony murder, once the jury has come in with a verdict to felony murder--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,419.715,419.936,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,419.936,431.713,"--as opposed to premeditated murder, then the possible application later of the felony murder aggravator, so-called, does not narrow that subset of first degree murders, i.e. felony murders, any further."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,431.713,432.063,That's correct.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,432.063,432.844,We agree on that?
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,432.844,433.125,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,433.125,448.873,"And as I understand it, your position is there is a further narrowing which is constitutionally sufficient, and that further narrowing is the result of applying, in effect, the Tison standard, the threshold proportionality standard that Tison imposed, right?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,448.873,474.391,"That certainly occurs independent of the aggravator, and we would contend it also occurs during the penalty phase when the jury considers all of the factors that an additional narrowing takes place, but in terms of the recklessness standard, that's constitutionally required by Tison, and it does restrict the State's ability to impose death on anyone who does not meet that standard."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,474.391,486.349,"Well, is it your position that the application of the Tison standard satisfies the constitutional requirement of narrowing?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,492.163,497.406,Our position is that the entire system accomplishes that--
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.406,497.756,"Well, can you give me--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,497.756,498.197,--as an aggravator--
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,498.197,499.086,"--Excuse me, general, please."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,499.086,499.627,--Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,500.268,501.848,Can you give me a yes or no answer?
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,511.374,513.655,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,513.655,515.477,Right.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,531.517,535.581,"Maybe, and maybe not, if I could explain."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,549.148,553.082,"Well, do you think that your premeditated class is vaguely defined?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,553.082,566.112,"--I think in recent months the Tennessee supreme court has begun to very narrowly define premeditated murder, and I think it is possible that it would serve... could serve as a valid aggravating circumstance."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,566.112,578.3,"So that, again, if it satisfied... if premeditated... if the class of premeditated murder is so defined as to pass muster under Tison, no further narrowing would be required constitutionally."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,578.3,583.172,"Under... yes, under Tison and under Creech and Godfrey."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.172,589.748,"So Tison has basically, on your view, superseded the narrowing requirement, hasn't it?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,589.748,591.456,"No, it--"
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,591.456,595.049,If you satisfy Tison you're home free so far as narrowing is--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,595.049,595.4,--No.
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.263,652.917,"--Well, intent murders would... what you have called simple intent murders would satisfy Tison."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,652.917,653.237,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.534,669.8,"All right, but I would take it that as a general proposition, all first degree murders would... let's just stick to premeditated for a moment."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,677.733,685.138,"Yes, but again, unless premeditated murder were a felony murder, Tison really isn't applicable."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,685.138,690.152,"Well, premeditated at least by the Tennessee definition is not a... could not be a felony murder."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,692.514,697.116,"Well, but a pre... someone could kill in a premeditated fashion in the course of a felony."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,697.116,698.418,"And just be convicted of felony murder, yes."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,698.418,703.751,"Yes, or they could be convicted of premeditated murder and be subject to the felony murder aggravating circumstance."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,703.751,711.985,"All right, in which case... but that's not the case before us, because in that case a further narrowing would in fact be taking place."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,721.552,723.034,Yes--
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.034,723.382,All right.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,723.382,724.123,--as we've discussed it.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,724.123,740.275,Then does it not follow from the position you're taking with respect to Tison's application to felony murder that no further narrowing need take place in the premeditated murder category because it satisfies Tison.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,740.275,753.122,"I would not agree because it satisfies Tison, but I would agree that you could have, in the way we've discussed it, a premeditated, aggravating circumstance, so that--"
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,753.122,754.313,"Well, there's one thing I'm just not getting, then."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,766.252,783.552,"--Justice Souter, I guess... and I don't mean to pick this point, but Tison as we have read it is a case involving the standard, the threshold standard for felony murders and participants in felony murder, not premeditated murders, and that's why--"
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,783.552,789.908,"No, but it's applying... it's applying an Eighth Amendment threshold, and the Eighth Amendment threshold would apply to any case, wouldn't it?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,789.908,790.258,--Correct.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.295,815.113,"Exactly, so that if Tison is your means of satisfying for felony murder, and a premeditated murder always exceeds the Tison threshold, then doesn't it follow that there need be no further narrowing in a premeditated murder case--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,815.113,819.065,I have said--
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,819.065,819.466,--or among the class--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,819.466,820.966,--I have said... that's what I have said.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.717,822.168,--Okay.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,822.168,822.969,Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,822.969,826.001,"General Burson, maybe--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,826.001,826.392,"Yes, Justice--"
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,826.392,829.284,--I can ask the same question this way.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,840.681,841.98,--Yes.
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,841.98,853.718,"You said premeditated is a higher... kind of a higher category, and yet you do need an aggravator under the Tennessee law for premeditated murder."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,874.813,879.016,"Justice Ginsburg, I think we're talking about in premeditated the mens rea of intent."
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,955.045,966.563,"So at the sentencing stage, felony murder is considered the graver offense than premeditated, because it doesn't need any additional aggravator, is that--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,966.563,981.983,It is considered the offense that the General Assembly has determined they have a reasonable chance of deterring by increasing the severity of the penalty to death.
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.255,1019.478,"--General Burson, when did the General Assembly make this determination?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1021.94,1028.023,"This statute I think was in '77 or so, and--"
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.023,1034.529,"What if this murder had taken place before 1987, when Tison was decided?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1045.425,1054.811,--I think that the recklessness component of it certainly gives it a--
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.811,1059.975,Where does the requirement to satisfy a recklessness component come from?
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1060.846,1061.765,--It comes from... yes.
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.765,1068.41,"So if you didn't have Tison on the books, which wasn't decided till 1987, your statute was then unconstitutional, I assume."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1070.283,1071.242,"Well, to the extent--"
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.242,1072.213,--constitutional once Tison was decided.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1072.213,1078.258,"--To the extent it would have applied to one who acts less than reckless, and we also had--"
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.258,1081.69,"But then we have no finding of recklessness in this case, do we?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1081.69,1083.93,"--No, but I think the--"
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1083.93,1084.581,Because there's no such instruction.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1084.581,1104.364,"--The... we don't, but the court made it very clear, the Tennessee supreme court, that it would perform this type of proportionality review, and I think this Court said in Cabana v. Bullock that that proportionality review was not required by the jury, that it was sufficient if the appellate court applied the Tison standard."
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1104.364,1124.526,"If you would carry Justice Stevens' analogy back, you might say that before this Court decided Enmund in 1983, maybe from 1977 to 1983 the statute was constitutional, from 1983 to 1987 it wasn't, and after 1987 it is."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1124.526,1127.909,"Well, yes, and the Tennessee supreme--"
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.909,1132.942,"Of course, we don't know whether your supreme court might not have read in the Tison requirement on its own, do we?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1139.316,1139.997,--I--
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.997,1143.75,"I mean, you claim they've gone further than we have in the present case."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1150.153,1152.056,"--Your, Honor, I can't say that they addressed that."
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.056,1157.029,But at least it isn't the Tennessee legislature that required the recklessness requirement.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1158.641,1160.181,"No, no, I'm not suggesting that."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1168.947,1183.755,"The Tennessee supreme court did address the question of the relative culpability of premeditated murder and felony murder, didn't it, and it found them equal in culpability under the statute, didn't it?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1183.755,1186.658,"Correct, and we would agree that they are equal in culpability."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1186.658,1191.382,"Well, aren't you... doesn't that then go back to Justice Ginsburg's question of a moment ago?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1212.143,1221.93,"Justice Souter, our position is that the Eighth Amendment allows an aggravator to have, as a justifying rationale, deterrence--"
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1221.93,1222.32,"Well, you--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1222.32,1228.115,"--or retribution, so you do not have to set up an aggravator based upon culpability."
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.115,1233.358,"--I'm... maybe I don't understand your answer, but it doesn't seem to me that that responds to the question."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1244.715,1246.468,Let me see if I could respond this way.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1277.848,1282.482,I still don't... maybe I'm missing a... I don't think you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1282.482,1286.543,If you are... maybe I don't understand the question.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1286.543,1299.332,"I thought her question was... in any case, my question is, as the supreme court of Tennessee has construed it, the two subcategories are first degree murder of equal culpability, isn't that... is that correct?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1299.332,1301.132,Correct.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1301.132,1303.425,"Okay, and you narrow--"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1303.425,1304.053,Comparable.
1993.92-989,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1304.053,1308.627,"--those convicted in the one category, you don't of those convicted in the other."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1311.43,1314.661,I don't know how to say it any other way than I have said it.
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.474,1339.338,"Well, you say that that aggravating circumstance is not constitutionally required anyway."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1349.964,1353.026,"No, then I was misunderstood."
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.099,1363.104,I thought you said it was enough simply to have first degree murder defined the way your State defines it--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1363.104,1364.043,And then--
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.043,1365.796,--and you would not have any further--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1365.796,1366.253,"--Oh, I see."
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1366.474,1368.557,--aggravating circumstance at all.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1368.557,1372.157,"I think under Lowenfield that's possible, yes."
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.157,1388.45,"So then whatever... even if Justice Souter's... is correct that you have an aggravating circumstance for the one type of first degree murder but not for the other, it is not an aggravating circumstance in your view that is required by the Federal Constitution."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1388.45,1388.76,I think--
1993.92-989,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.76,1391.001,It's one that Tennessee chose to create on its own.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1391.001,1393.082,--I think under Lowenfield that's correct.
1993.92-989,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.082,1408.031,"But once you have an aggravator, don't you have to have some rationale for having it in the one case and not in the other?"
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1408.031,1413.366,I would suggest that not if it's... not as a constitutional proposition.
1993.92-989,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1415.617,1428.074,I thought your whole position here was that felony is itself a discrete category which is a sufficient aggravator.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1428.074,1430.197,It is--
1993.92-989,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1430.197,1436.93,I don't know why you're running away from that just a little bit in response to Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg's question.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1446.896,1449.148,"--Justice Kennedy, I agree with that."
1993.92-989,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.148,1449.579,I thought that's what your position--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1449.579,1457.114,"That is my position, and where it seems to me we are... the... we're elevating almost form over substance."
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.99,1490.064,"--Well then, do you contend it would be constitutional to have the death penalty imposed for a felony murder that the only intent... there's no recklessness involved."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1498.161,1500.933,"You mean, and you are an accomplice, or you are the killer?"
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.933,1509.388,"You are a robber, and in the course of the robbery, maybe you stumble, and you accidentally shoot the gun and the man gets killed."
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1521.797,1543.359,"As the Court's formulation of the standard is now, yes, because the Court just says you have to... under the Enmund standard, you only have to kill and it doesn't require... the Court hasn't addressed a particular standard, but clearly an accomplice would have to at least be reckless before that would happen, but if you killed--"
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.359,1545.452,I'm assuming no recklessness on the part of the killer.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1552.386,1558.86,"--It's hard for me to believe that the Court would not apply that same recklessness standard, and I would suggest that that probably--"
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.86,1562.083,But that's the extent--
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1562.083,1562.504,--would not be upheld.
1993.92-989,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.504,1564.834,--of your narrowing requirement under your statute.
1993.92-989,0,18503,charles_w_burson,,1569.857,1575.342,"Yes, and that's overlaid with this Court's jurisprudence on recklessness."
1993.92-989,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1577.392,1579.273,"Very well, General Burson."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1581.396,1588.259,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.165,1651.752,"Well, is your point that that's irrational, and therefore doesn't meet rational basis review?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1651.752,1658.707,"--Well, I think my point is that the Tennessee... this is what the Tennessee supreme court found to violate the Tennessee constitution."
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.234,1681.761,"Well, but does it violate the Federal Constitution so long as the narrowing within the definition of first degree murder is alone enough to comply with our narrowing requirement?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1681.761,1690.908,"No, I believe it does, because the problem is we're not just talking about narrowing here, but some principled narrowing, and this is exactly what the--"
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.908,1695.48,"That's your point, that it's unprincipled and fails rational basis review."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1695.48,1696.301,"--Yes, it fails--"
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1696.301,1702.935,What's the last case of ours that held a State statute failed rational basis review?
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1702.935,1707.758,"--I can't point you to a case, Your Honor, but looking at what the Tennessee--"
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.758,1708.169,Many moons.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1710.08,1717.746,"--That may be, but the Tennessee supreme court here has found that it violates Article I, section 16 of the Tennessee constitution."
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.977,1726.979,"Well, they're free to find it violates the Tennessee constitution."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1739.878,1749.787,"I understand that, but the point I would like to make first, Your Honor, if I may, is that this is an independent State ground that the Tennessee supreme court has relied on."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1749.787,1771.439,"Two of the three in the majority said this holding, based on Article I, section 16 of the Tennessee constitution, so two of them put it squarely and apparently solely on the Tennessee constitution, but they concurred in the principal opinion, which puts it on both grounds."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1771.439,1780.164,"But I think, Your Honor, under the majority opinion that there are alternative, independent, adequate State grounds."
1993.92-989,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.486,1858.497,"Mr. Stebbins, can I just interrupt you to--"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1858.497,1858.998,--Certainly.
1993.92-989,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.998,1867.283,"--You made a motion on this point that I think the Court denied, and your position is fully stated in your brief, so I wonder if you're making the best use of your time."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1867.283,1887.044,"I just wanted to make a couple of quick points on it, Your Honor, because at least in one other case... I'm familiar with this case in a similar situation, Ohio v. Huertas just a couple of terms ago, did dismiss the writ after argument, and most of the argument was based on a State law analysis, but I will be very brief, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1909.33,1914.333,Is the page you're referring to in the appendix to the petition?
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1914.333,1926.501,"Excuse me, Your Honor, I'll... the... page 61 and 62, A-61 and 62 of the appendix to the petition for cert.--"
1993.92-989,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.674,1954.198,I notice that Tennessee has as one of its aggravating factors the killing of a child under 12 years of age.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1954.198,1955.219,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.219,1964.747,"If someone kills an 11-year-old, can they argue under your theory that really it's irrational to distinguish between someone who kills an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1964.747,1967.076,"Under my theory, no, I don't think so."
1993.92-989,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1968.238,1970.108,What's the rationality there that's not present here?
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1970.108,1974.473,"--Well, there you've got something that is different from the crime itself."
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.364,1995.615,But that's only one type of first degree murder.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,1995.615,1996.036,--That's correct.
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.036,2003.983,So you have an aggravator which in effect says this one type of first degree murder is worse than the other type of first degree murder.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2030.419,2031.27,Well--
1993.92-989,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.27,2040.567,"And I should think it's eminently more rational than the 11-year-old, 12-year-old dichotomy, because the State is interested in deterring felonies."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2040.567,2051.483,"--But as the Tennessee supreme court found, though, that the Tennessee legislature has defined felony murderers and premeditated murderers to be equally culpable."
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2073.297,2081.774,Where do you... where... what cases of ours do you rely on for the proposition that there is this sort of rationality requirement in the Eighth Amendment?
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2081.774,2104.217,"--Well, just last term in Arave v. Creech, this Court held that there was... where an aggravating circumstance serves to distinguish those who are sentenced to death from those who are not, that the aggravating circumstance must genuinely narrow on a principle basis, and the Tennessee supreme court essentially here has said this is not principled."
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.217,2109.412,"That's where you derive the rationality requirement from then, in the Eighth Amendment?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2109.412,2124.613,"For one, Your Honor, yes, and I think also in Zant v. Stevens this court addressed that the aggravating circumstances where they are used to narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty must have some rational penalogical basis."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2133.796,2145.165,"Mr. Stebbins, maybe it would be better if we were to deal with a concrete case than to talk in these abstract categories, and let me tell you one that has been on my mind."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2198.98,2204.225,"Well, first of all I think that's incorrect under what I'm saying."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2212.39,2217.531,"No, no, no, in the felony murder case you don't have any premeditated."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2231.821,2239.508,"Yes, but the premeditated murderer with nothing else, without the additional felony, could not be sentenced to death."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2239.508,2251.346,"I'm asking you why in those two concrete situations it isn't perfectly logical, rational, to treat them the same, to say that both are subject to the death penalty?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2251.346,2260.351,"Well, very simply, in the one hypothetical, Your Honor, you've got... as I understand it, and perhaps I misunderstand your hypothetical, but you've got premeditation and something else."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2282.705,2295.915,"But why can't the State think in terms of dangerousness, in terms of deterrent, it wants to deter that reckless action as much as the premeditated action?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2295.915,2298.105,"That's my point exactly, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2314.084,2320.259,"In my hypothetical you are not treating them equally, and you say that's okay, and that I don't understand."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2332.237,2334.46,Yes.
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2367.743,2376.388,"Your point is that it's irrational, constitutionally impermissible, for the State to say premeditated and reckless are on the same line."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2378.038,2378.209,--No.
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2391.967,2399.732,"--In my hypothetical, you're saying it's necessary to comport with the Constitution to treat the felony murder better."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2401.553,2402.705,--I--
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2402.705,2414.112,"--because in my hypothetical the premeditated robber is subject to the death penalty, the reckless robber is not, so the reckless robber is being treated better, not the same."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2414.112,2422.648,--But the premeditated robber is being treated worse because of there is an additional element proven in the crime... the robbery.
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2450.574,2471.04,"But you would agree, would you not, in my two hypothetical cases, that your answer is yes, in that situation you must favor the felony murderer by making that reckless robber not subject to the death penalty where the premeditated robber is?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2471.04,2480.724,"Again, Your Honor, I appear to be missing your point on this, or I'm not explaining myself well."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2486.148,2491.752,"Well, why don't you just stick with my hypothetical, and tell me... we have a robbery of a home."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2511.165,2513.287,"--No, I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2513.287,2518.758,But the State could subject the premeditated robber to the death penalty.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2518.758,2519.69,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2519.69,2527.905,"So if yes to those questions, to both, then you're saying it's constitutionally required to favor the felony murderer."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2527.905,2534.02,"Again, it's not favoring the felony... reckless felony murderer, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.007,2586.523,"So you're saying that in a... let's take a totally hypothetical situation, unlike Tennessee, that a State cannot make a felony murder that qualifies under Tison's recklessness, they cannot make that a capital offense without some aggravating circumstance?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2586.523,2588.496,"I believe that's true, Your Honor, and I also believe--"
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.496,2591.098,"Now, what case would you rely on for that?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2591.098,2623.428,"--Your Honor, I would say that if you look at this Court's holding in all of its holdings from like, Gregg, and Zant, and Creech last year, whenever there has been a definition by a State that is as broad as this, that includes felony murder with no intent, it includes plain, premeditated murder as the basis for death eligibility, that every State where this Court has looked, it has required proof of some additional--"
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.428,2635.117,"But I asked you for a case from this Court that supports the answer that you just gave, and to say that the States have required something more doesn't necessarily mean that the Constitution requires it."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2635.117,2663.925,"--I believe, though, if you look at this Court's opinion in Lowenfield, for example, Lowenfield says the States may do two things, they may broadly define death-eligible crimes, and if they broadly define them, i.e. saying felony murder or premeditation, then they must have an aggravating circumstance that narrows the class, or they may very narrowly define the class of death-eligible murderers as Texas and Louisiana have done."
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2669.077,2693.323,"Well, so don't you think it represents a sufficient narrowing in the terms that Lowenfield used that if they say... if the State says, from all homicides we are going to choose premeditated murder and felony murder that meets the Tison qualification, and we're not going to have aggravating circumstances."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2696.285,2699.989,This Court simply has never approved such a scheme.
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2699.989,2702.109,"Well, it may never have, but has it ever disapproved it?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2702.109,2730.639,"No, the State has never disapproved it, either, but again, if you look at this last term in Creech, this Court analyzed the Idaho statute and looked at it and declared it very broad, and the Court went on to look at the aggravating circumstance that was at issue in that case and found that under the Idaho scheme and under the Eighth Amendment, that it was necessary for the aggravating circumstance to narrow that class of death-eligible people."
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.639,2731.978,Mr. Stebbins--
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2731.978,2732.239,The... yes.
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.239,2734.29,--you don't need aggravating circumstances at all.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2743.466,2746.469,If the definition is sufficiently narrow--
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.469,2752.602,"Well, let's assume that what Tennessee has is this situation."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2780.301,2782.211,"--I... I... no, it would not, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.692,2783.944,--It would not.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2784.222,2785.975,--It would not... two reasons.
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2790.216,2790.767,What... what... what?
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2800.384,2802.725,Perhaps I misunderstood your hypothetical.
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.885,2807.359,It's a very broad definition of first degree murder.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2823.459,2830.604,--I don't believe that this Court would find that that provides adequate guidance for the jury or have sufficiently narrowed the class.
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.255,2835.727,"Well, that's the right answer for your case."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2842.513,2843.33,--Yes.
1993.92-989,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2845.544,2861.103,"Mr. Stebbins, I thought Tennessee had not opened up every felony murder to the death penalty but only the commission of murder in the course of committing certain named felonies."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2861.103,2862.685,"--That's correct, Your Honor, there's eight--"
1993.92-989,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2862.685,2864.425,So there has been a narrowing.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2868.088,2881.296,"--There has been... yes, not every felony is included in that, but every felony that is included in the definition of first degree murder is also included in the aggravating circumstance."
1993.92-989,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2881.296,2886.661,"Yes, but of course, Lowenfield says that the narrowing can be done at the guilt phase."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2893.205,2893.414,No.
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.475,2934.63,"But in Arave, Mr. Stebbins, the challenge was that the aggravating circumstance was too vague, wasn't it?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2938.684,2973.726,"Well, the Court went on, and after determining vagueness to discuss and state very plainly that not only must the aggravating circumstance be definite, but it must genuinely narrow, and do so on a principled basis, citing Zant v. Stevens primarily for that proposition, and this Court has held where a State uses aggravating circumstance to genuinely narrow... whether they have to or not, but where they do, they have to narrow in a principled manner and they have to define a class of persons that's more culpable than another class."
1993.92-989,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2989.788,2990.517,Mr. Stebbins--
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,2990.517,2990.978,Yes.
1993.92-989,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2990.978,2992.029,--just a question of Tennessee law.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3002.377,3008.238,A nonpremeditated killing during the course of an unlisted--
1993.92-989,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3008.238,3009.169,An unlisted felony.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3009.169,3019.938,--The fact that it was committed during another felony that's not listed in the first degree murder statute would have no effect on it.
1993.92-989,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3022.851,3023.79,So it wouldn't be murder at all.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3023.79,3026.411,Correct.
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.932,3031.295,"Well, how... are you sure that's the correct answer, Mr. Stebbins?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3043.284,3046.703,Perhaps I got the hypothetical wrong.
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3046.703,3047.665,I may have misunderstood his--
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3060.814,3063.526,"If it was an intentional murder, it would be murder."
1993.92-989,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3063.526,3068.78,"So there is a narrowing, then, that does indeed go on."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3068.78,3080.307,"Yes, but the fact it would require intent, and the fact that a nonlisted felony was also committed would have no effect at all on the determination that it's murder."
1993.92-989,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3082.948,3089.192,"The fact of the felony would be irrelevant, but it would still be classified as murder if it was an intentional killing."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3089.192,3093.226,"If it was an intentional killing, it would be classified as second degree murder, that's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3102.542,3119.793,"Counsel, as I understand your argument, just before you subside, Justice Ginsburg asked you a question about a robbery with an intentional murder and a robbery with a reckless murder."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3141.166,3141.897,That's correct.
1993.92-989,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3141.897,3151.173,"And what you're saying is they're equally culpable, and that this is the differential that's unconstitutional."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3156.426,3163.762,I'm saying a felony is not a sufficient aggravator where the underlying crime is felony murder.
1993.92-989,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3163.762,3168.303,So you're not challenging it as an aggravator for the premeditated--
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3168.303,3169.124,"No, I'm not, Your Honor."
1993.92-989,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.883,3189.488,--Going back to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical about a felony murderer who in one case is reckless and in the other case deliberately kills--
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3189.488,3190.149,Yes.
1993.92-989,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.149,3197.843,--would you say that it's irrational to say that the one who is reckless is less culpable than the one who killed deliberately?
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3197.843,3199.736,Is it irrational to say that the... no.
1993.92-989,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.959,3214.205,"Would you say the contrary view would be irrational, and if you don't say it, why don't you say it?"
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3214.465,3216.375,"Well, yes, I would."
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.081,3238.589,Surely--
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3238.589,3239.961,--and that's the way the Tennessee system operates.
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.961,3252.719,--Surely you're not suggesting that every time a State creates an aggravator it is acting unconstitutionally if it has not included as an aggravator something that is even worse than the aggravators it has included.
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3259.723,3260.835,Absolutely not.
1993.92-989,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.786,3263.517,"--Well, they put one aggravator here."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3265.049,3270.522,"Well, what the Tennessee supreme court has said, though, is that they can't do that under the Tennessee constitution."
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3275.475,3277.665,"Thank you, Mr. Stebbins."
1993.92-989,1,21587,david_c_stebbins,,3277.665,3279.227,Thank you.
1993.92-989,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3279.227,3281.348,"General Burson, you have 3 minutes remaining."
1993.92-989,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,3281.348,3282.958,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-989,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.631,3304.472,Do you hold--
1993.92-989,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,3304.472,3304.963,--and we would suggest--
1993.92-989,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.963,3314.66,"--the part of Lowenfield that says to pass constitutional muster a capital sentencing scheme must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death... you agree with that, don't you?"
1993.92-989,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,3314.66,3316.451,"--Yes, and we would suggest that this does."
1993.92-989,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.622,3403.699,"General, do you think that Tison holds that recklessness is equally culpable with intent, or does it merely hold that the recklessness in that case was sufficient to cross the constitutional threshold?"
1993.92-989,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,3403.699,3416.415,"I think it's clear in the opinion of the case that what it said is that recklessness could be equally culpable to premeditated murders, and there were a number of examples, and this case, this case proves that point."
1993.92-989,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3417.207,3419.678,In that case there were three other aggravating circumstances--
1993.92-989,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,3419.678,3420.71,--In this--
1993.92-989,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.71,3421.07,--in Tison.
1993.92-989,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,3421.07,3421.638,--Yes.
1993.92-989,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.613,3427.653,Your argument doesn't depend on that.
1993.92-989,2,18503,charles_w_burson,,3427.653,3447.958,"It certainly doesn't, but if this killing were reckless, if this person plunged a knife into the chest of this person recklessly and not with premeditation, then that certainly proves the point that this recklessness could rise to the culpability of any intentional killing, or any premeditated killing."
1993.92-989,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3450.071,3451.513,"Thank you, General Burson."
