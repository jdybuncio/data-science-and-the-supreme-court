1968.814,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,37.533,"Number 814, Raymond Joseph Duvernay, petitioner versus the United States."
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,38.599,42.918,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,516.19,522.433,Did the Board -- did the Board have a power to do anything at the time that he brought --
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,522.433,529.663,"Mr. Justice Stewart, 1625.2 says that Board has discretion to reopen after a notice of induction at issue."
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,544.227,545.924,The ladies' induction?
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,545.924,551.531,"They asked, they wrote to the state director and asked him for him to do an induction delay."
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,551.531,552.955,But they didn't re-classify.
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,552.955,557.843,Didn't re-classify him but it's just a backhanded way of giving him a deferment.
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.753,564.21,And no control.
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,564.21,565.178,They still have no control.
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,565.178,567.424,"But that -- you're not alleging that, are you?"
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,567.424,568.46,Yes sir.
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.576,571.61,What circumstances over which he had no control?
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,571.61,576.319,"Well, as the way I put it and you know, take it, or not but I think that it's valid."
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,662.438,668.982,The -- this Ku Klux Klan leader was a member of the Board against -- what chairman of the Board?
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,668.982,669.669,He was chairman of the Board.
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,669.669,675.296,"At the time your client was the classified 1-A, is that right?"
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,675.296,680.863,"And he was also chairman when the man, when my client was doing up there and asking him for this exemption."
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,680.863,681.34,He was.
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,681.34,681.649,Yes sir.
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,681.649,688.687,"I saw some little difference, I saw some little difference in the opinion on then the briefs that he left by the time your --"
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,688.687,692.547,"In my recollection, I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure that he was there."
1968.814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,696.996,698.583,Although you weren't allowed to show that way.
1968.814,0,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,699.89,700.868,I didn't make an offer of proof.
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1335.879,1338.846,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.814,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1377.72,1378.798,Then what?
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1378.798,1382.703,Unless there has been a change in the registrant's circumstance.
1968.814,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1601.26,1621.001,"Mr. Martin, may I ask, when was in relation to the time between the date that he was ordered for induction and the date that he was to be inducted does he allege that his condition changed?"
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1621.001,1624.077,"Mr. Chief Justice, he alleges no change."
1968.814,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1630.41,1632.867,When does -- when he does the claim?
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1632.867,1675.21,"He said that the change occurred between January 19th, 1966, the day he was classified 1-A and April 13th, 1966, the day the Board issued its order to report for induction but at no time during that period when this change occurred according to petitioner did petitioner go to the board and said there has been a change in my circumstances that classification which you gave me 1-A was right at the time but now there are other factors which I think show that I'm entitled to a either hardship or occupational deferment."
1968.814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.278,1727.439,"Now, this is all before people of 13, I gather, as you now confessed yourself."
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1727.439,1727.878,That's right.
1968.814,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1729.366,1752.621,"Is it your position about the statute that if these are the changed circumstances on which petitioner relies, they're not available to or on April 13th because its only circumstances, changes in circumstances which occurred after that date over which he had no control of which would permit the Board to do anything at all about it."
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1752.621,1753.269,That is correct.
1968.814,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1777.52,1784.712,"Well, I gather your point is that at that juncture, the Board would have had the authority of power jurisdiction which he will do something about."
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1784.712,1785.27,That's correct.
1968.814,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1785.27,1793.144,"But after April 13, they had no authority power or whatever to do anything as to circumstances which develop before."
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1793.144,1802.897,That is correct Mr. Justice and that is the basic position that we're urging that once that notice to report for induction came.
1968.814,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2030.665,2037.262,What was the last day upon which he could make an application for a reclassification?
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2037.262,2047.428,"I think that he'd come in anytime prior to the time he was noted, he was sent his notice to report for induction, the Board could have considered the claim."
1968.814,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2047.428,2050.25,That was January 19th?
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2050.25,2053.353,"He was set the notice to report for induction April 13th,."
1968.814,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2055.791,2056.799,Yes.
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2056.799,2059.052,He was sent the notice to report on April 13.
1968.814,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2127.823,2134.817,May I ask you that specifically answers this contention by this question.
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2172.149,2177.736,"Well, I think Mr. Justice, it operates in this way."
1968.814,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2205.321,2217.652,"Well, his contention is the Board was improperly classified by an illegal board and therefore he hadn't been classified at all and there's no basis for ordering him to present himself."
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2217.652,2219.608,What I'm saying response there's two things.
1968.814,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2256.971,2266.055,But he says that he was ordered by a board that was no board because he treats it.
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2273.803,2279.232,"Well, I don't think that that necessarily would follow."
1968.814,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2287.736,2293.991,"That might be true but don't you have to get to his issues, how can we decide the case without getting to his issues."
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2293.991,2306.997,"Well, I think there is one way you could do -- one way you can do it is to look to see is there any possibility that the racial composition of this Board could have affected his classification and we submit that on the facts presented by the record, there was no way."
1968.814,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2312.263,2318.296,How does he raise his constitutional question on all the premises as you're suggesting to the Court.
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2321.071,2322.277,"Well, he was allowed."
1968.814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.622,2350.116,"Well then, (Inaudible) suppose, I would classify, no board was called, is that the claim of the Government."
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2359.136,2360.382,That's right.
1968.814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.382,2365.4,You stated to do that margins is having those defense --
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2365.4,2371.326,I think we would contend that by failing to proceed through the appeal --
1968.814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.326,2373.883,"like that, because there is no board, no power board to --"
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2373.883,2385.503,That's right because the appeal -- basically which claimed here somehow that my classification is wrong and that he'd be taken the case to a higher board and then that board could by a change of classification.
1968.814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.503,2389.864,"Well, you say, you didn't claim like that --"
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2389.864,2394.208,"That's correct, that he could go a step higher if he properly pursued his remedies."
1968.814,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2394.208,2397.949,"Well,he says as to that, he didn't know the facts."
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2405.262,2407.682,That's correct but I think this brings into play --
1968.814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.682,2413.059,Does it not would have been true even if his initial classification.
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2424.763,2425.39,That's true.
1968.814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.39,2429.889,By racially discriminatory board.
1968.814,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2429.889,2433.592,We'll recess now.
1968.814,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2433.592,2439.079,Courts should not have considered that claim on the merits.
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3456.386,3463.979,I only have a few thing I want to talk about in connection with what has been said Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.814,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3590.307,3617.657,"You mean when you read that as an official action of the Board not on a finding that something that happened after the notice of induction went out and that's something being something beyond the control of the registrant but they just acted on the request and deferred him themselves, asking the state director to cancel the induction but the action you're telling is, was the action of the Board, is that it?"
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3617.657,3618.506,Yes sir.
1968.814,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3624.241,3633.895,"This might what you can't tell because it's ambiguous but this might well have been a change for reasons beyond his control, i.e., he was called to attend the police academy."
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3633.895,3635.154,He volunteered.
1968.814,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3636.463,3638.94,"Well, I don't know the man, we just can't tell from this footnote."
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3638.94,3642.386,I can't tell from here that he is a policeman in training.
1968.814,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3653.196,3658.481,"The Board might have been exceeding his powers in that case, do it, under the regulation?"
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3658.481,3659.998,It might have been.
1968.814,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3715.437,3724.975,Members of the local Selective Service Boards are in all cases appointed by the President of the United States on the advice of the governor on respective states.
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3724.975,3725.483,Yes sir.
1968.814,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3725.483,3727.621,No other way that they become members?
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3727.621,3728.97,Not to my knowledge Mr. Justice Stewart.
1968.814,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3728.97,3733.271,"And is this also true to the appeals board, the state appeals board?"
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3733.271,3734.649,"Yes, I think that's true too."
1968.814,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3734.649,3737.076,"Recommended by the governor, appointed by the president of the United States."
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3737.076,3738.154,Yes.
1968.814,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3773.695,3782.75,You mean that in all -- you mean no constitutional questions were ever raised in the administrative proceedings and passed upon.
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3782.75,3784.397,"Well, I guess they are."
1968.814,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3787.205,3788.433,"You know they are, don't you?"
1968.814,2,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3788.433,3802.707,"Yes they are but mainly what the boards are here for is to use their expertise in classification and at the same time, I think it's going to be very difficult and sort of an unrealistic to simply say to the Board, “Look, you're badly constituted."
1968.814,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3809.957,3811.605,Very well.
