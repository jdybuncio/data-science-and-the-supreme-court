1989.89-535,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,We'll hear argument now in Louis W. Sullivan v. Elizabeth Stroop.
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,8.754,12.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,107.769,110.221,The statute does say any child support payments.
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,110.221,111.204,"Yes, it does, Justice White."
1989.89-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,111.204,115.125,And these are payments to a child or for the child's benefit.
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,115.125,115.825,That is true.
1989.89-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,115.825,116.958,"So, what do you do?"
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,120.827,124.231,It... it is a term of art within the statute.
1989.89-535,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.631,240.706,"--Mr. Sloan, essentially your response to Justice White's question, the statute does say any child support payments, and your response is yes, it says any child support payments."
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,243.658,247.76,"Well, the word any modifies the term child support, and we believe that the--"
1989.89-535,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.76,251.83,"--So you either italicize the ""any"" or you italicize the ""child support payments""--"
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,251.83,257.584,"--Well, I think even if you italicize the ""any"", you still have the word ""child support"", and you have to interpret what that means."
1989.89-535,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.833,314.154,"--Mr. Sloan, what does the Secretary do if the payments come in as spousal maintenance?"
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,316.289,321.408,"There is a disregard in certain limited circumstances, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-535,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.366,412.918,"Although there they are not, strictly speaking, child support payments, I guess."
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,412.918,419.507,"That is true, although they are linked so closely to child support that Congress has determined that they serve a child support purpose."
1989.89-535,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.507,425.428,"Well, I guess that is the argument being made for the Title II benefit payments."
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,425.428,429.445,"That is true, with this important difference, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-535,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,449.359,455.863,Do any of the Secretary's regulations expressly exclude the Title II payments?
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,455.863,457.28,"No, they don't, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-535,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,514.635,521.222,I... I take it the term that you give to these payments are child insurance benefits?
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,521.222,523.174,"That is the term the statute gives to them, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-535,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,523.174,524.891,"Well, is that the term that you give as well?"
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,524.891,529.061,"Yes, that is correct."
1989.89-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.763,541.036,Where are these... where are these payments... particular payments identified as child insurance payments?
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,541.036,547.29,"--In Title II, in 42 U.S.C., let me--"
1989.89-535,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,547.29,555.962,"Section 402, is it not?"
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,555.962,556.662,--Pardon?
1989.89-535,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,556.662,558.597,"Section 42 U.S.C., Section 402?"
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,558.597,560.214,Yes.
1989.89-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.214,561.716,And what does it say?
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,564.818,567.186,"Well, yes, I believe it is the heading, Justice White."
1989.89-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.186,567.853,Thanks a lot.
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,573.09,573.657,Okay.
1989.89-535,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.492,832.025,Timeliness requirement in the '88 amendments?
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,832.025,832.444,Yes.
1989.89-535,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.444,833.644,That also?
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,833.644,836.145,"Yes, that is."
1989.89-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.694,863.379,These other... these other child support payments?
1989.89-535,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,863.379,865.248,--These child support payments.
1989.89-535,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1269.06,1270.328,"Thank you, Mr. Sloan."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1275.03,1278.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1299.429,1314.438,"Well, Mr. Aliperti, as one who practiced law for 16 years and practiced some domestic relations law, child support payments, to me, speaking only for myself, is almost a word of art."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1320.008,1323.127,But that is exactly what Title II benefits are.
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.829,1330.198,"But it's not coming from an absent parent, it's coming from an insurance program."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1330.198,1335.285,"Well, Your Honor, I would submit that... that the Title II parents are absent."
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.028,1352.028,But the government is paying--
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1353.563,1362.169,"Well, the government may write the checks, but the checks are drawn from wages which the parents, which working parents have paid into the trust fund."
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.169,1365.288,"Well, that's the same as if you had a private insurance policy."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1375.893,1394.64,"Well, the fact of the matter is that the parent paid into the fund, and that by virtue of the work credits and the payments which the parent had made... paid into the fund, the amount of the payments that is made to the child is calculated."
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.101,1425.259,"But if... what if an aunt of one of the families that is on AFDC gives, gives some money to the mother and says this... this is to support your child."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1425.259,1427.028,"That would not be child support, Your Honor."
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.028,1427.911,Why not?
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1427.911,1428.628,Because it would not--
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.628,1430.896,Your definition is anything that supports the child.
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1430.896,1432.396,--It would not be coming from the parent.
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.352,1457.813,"Well, it seems to me you are either appealing to ordinary understanding, in which case I think the Chief Justice's description is... is what the ordinary understanding is, or you're appealing to the literal meaning of child support, in which case your answer to my question would be... would be the opposite."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1468.271,1474.692,"Well, Your Honor, that's part of the ordinary understanding of the term child support, is support by a parent to support one's child."
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.692,1477.727,"If you're appealing to ordinary understanding, I think it means--"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1477.727,1480.579,"That's what it says in the Random House Dictionary, Your Honor."
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1487.433,1495.422,--Certainly the intonation from that definition is that it is paid by the person who is responsible for the minor child.
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1495.422,1508.33,"Well, whether or not the payment comes indirectly through Title II or directly through payments out of a parent's wages does not lessen the support character of the Title II payment."
1989.89-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.15,1522.99,"xxx it seems to me, then, that you have to really meet the argument that we should defer to the Secretary's construction."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1526.608,1528.06,--We're saying it does mean any.
1989.89-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.06,1528.81,--Well--
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1528.81,1532.596,We're saying that Congress intended the disregard--
1989.89-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.596,1536.749,--But you have to define child support in order to say it means any.
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1536.749,1540.117,"--It is our position, Your Honor, that child support--"
1989.89-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.117,1556.663,"And I would think if you say it has to be coming from a parent, I would think that would be proper, or at least within the ballpark to say well, that really means child support from a parent who is paying it, right now, that writes the checks."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1556.663,1561.798,"--We're... we are contending that the parent does pay it, it is just indirectly through the insurance fund."
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.894,1615.867,Suppose I am a parent that has no legal obligation to support the child; there has been a divorce and the wife hasn't gotten any child support payment as part of the decree.
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1625.14,1630.025,"Well, under the Secretary's scenario, yes, it would be, because it would be a voluntary payment."
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.429,1639.481,What about you?
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1639.481,1655.973,"We would say that there is no question under Title II, because in order for a child to be eligible for Title II, that child must apply for the benefits and show that he was dependent upon the parent at the time the parent died, became disabled or retired."
1989.89-535,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1669.066,1674.868,"And they are all labeled in the statute as child insurance payments, I take it?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1678.505,1687.278,"There is some discrimination between child insurance payments and other forms of child support, both in the Social Security Act--"
1989.89-535,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.278,1694.197,"Well, but all of... all of these payments that you have just described are called child insurance payments under the statute, are they not?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1694.197,1699.251,"--Voluntary payments aren't referred to as child insurance payments, Your Honor."
1989.89-535,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1702.787,1715.261,"But all of the disability payments, payments based on disability, or payments because of the death of a parent upon whom the child was dependent, are called child insurance payments, are they not?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1715.261,1717.813,"That is the term that's... that's used, Your Honor."
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.422,1868.845,But what about the government's argument that the reason for the distinction is to encourage the absent living parents to keep making the payments?
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1868.845,1871.38,"Well, that is what the government is saying now, Your Honor."
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.397,1874.499,"Well, what about it?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1874.499,1878.051,--We contend that that is not the purpose behind the statute.
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1879.236,1882.105,"Well, what... what if it were the purpose behind the statute?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,1885.557,1890.025,"--No, Your Honor, because an incentive rationale could also apply to Title II payments."
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.49,2026.147,"Is there any, Mr. Aliperti, is there any discussion in the legislative history in connection with the conference report of the fact, the specific fact that the sibling deeming provision would encompass children who were receiving Social Security benefits?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2026.147,2026.782,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.419,2035.521,It is really subject to--
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2035.521,2041.342,We have to make an inference based on the path of enactment of the two statutes.
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.465,2085.288,"--What I am wondering is, is it possible, is it consistent with your understanding of the legislative history that Congress just didn't really think about this problem?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2102.813,2119.259,"--In conference reports in prior years, in '82 and '83, when the sibling deeming was passed by the Senate but defeated by the House, there was much discussion about sibling deeming being especially harsh on Social Security recipients--"
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.259,2120.342,"Oh, there was."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2120.342,2126.698,--these Title II payments and child support by living non-custodial parents.
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.698,2136.971,So your argument is that that indicates that the opposition in '84 was partially based on the effect on families that would the Social Security... have Social Security beneficiaries in them.
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2136.971,2137.537,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2168.542,2180.749,"Are there any other kinds of Social Security payments, other than those that can be characterized perhaps as child support, that would also have been covered by their concern?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2180.749,2188.503,"They were referring specifically to the child dependent payments, payments for dependent children."
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.798,2333.666,"Well, they could have used clearer language."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2334.3,2335.316,"Well, Congress could have said--"
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2335.316,2336.468,They could have said including Social Security benefits.
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2336.468,2343.121,--Congress could have said we intend this to apply to Social Security benefits as well as other forms of child support.
1989.89-535,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2343.121,2346.573,Or they might have said payments in lieu of child support.
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2346.573,2349.759,But they said any child support payments.
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.182,2390.169,But you yourself don't... don't argue that any payment to support children is a child support payment.
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2409.814,2426.092,"The reason for that, Your Honor, is that we contend that the ordinary meaning of child support does not include payments by someone other than the parent of the child, not from an uncle or from a friend or some other relative."
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.525,2430.044,"xxx include insurance payments, the ordinary meaning?"
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2430.044,2434.531,"--It includes insurance payments because we contend, Your Honor, that that is emanating from the parent."
1989.89-535,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.683,2468.936,"That may be, but I still find it hard to believe that the ordinary meaning of child support payment is a payment from an insurance company."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2472.656,2474.873,All it is is one step removed.
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.368,2499.058,"The ordinary meaning certainly does focus on the source, I think, the source being the parent."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2499.058,2518.769,"The source being the parent, again the payment wouldn't exist if the parent hadn't been making payments into the trust fund, and if that child had not been dependent upon that parent at the time that the parent either became deceased or retired or disabled."
1989.89-535,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.589,2525.725,"Yes, but let me, may I just ask this."
1989.89-535,1,28843,jamie_b_aliperti,,2550.49,2560.714,"Yes, Your Honor, and we can only speculate as to why Congress chose to apply the disregard to child support payments rather than to simply any income of the child."
1989.89-535,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.218,2851.751,"Thank you, Mr. Aliperti."
1989.89-535,2,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2853.603,2856.872,"Just a few brief points, Your Honor."
1989.89-535,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.876,2938.126,"May I ask you this question, Mr. Sloan, about his argument that if you look at the legislative history from '82 through '84, that you find in '82 and '83 there was concern about the sibling deeming program's effect on Title II recipients as well as support payments, and therefore if you read the whole legislative history as a package, it is fair to assume this mitigation purpose motivated his clients as well as the support people."
