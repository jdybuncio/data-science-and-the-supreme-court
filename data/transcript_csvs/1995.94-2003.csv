1995.94-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.937,"We'll hear argument now in No. 94-2003, Lotus Development Corporation v. Borland International."
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,11.269,14.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.628,73.442,And that fact finding found some protectable expression I take it.
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,73.442,77.576,"--Protectable expression and a lack of merger, Your Honor, and originality."
1995.94-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,107.939,112.633,I thought the First Circuit also found it was a method of operation and therefore not patentable.
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,112.633,114.025,But what it didn't... I'm sorry.
1995.94-2003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.13,117.888,"Copyrightable, yes."
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,119.611,120.061,I was here.
1995.94-2003,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,176.367,187.546,But isn't the difficulty that we have here is that there are varying sort of degrees of merger and utility?
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,250.207,252.018,"Respectfully, I would disagree, Justice Souter."
1995.94-2003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.329,307.707,"Well, part of what troubles people I suppose is that if you have a little menu command and all it says is exit, block, move, et cetera, maybe those are just functional."
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,314.642,322.697,"--This was the subject of the trial in the district court, Your Honor, and Judge Keeton was mindful of the Court's decision in Feist."
1995.94-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,383.109,395.828,"But at a certain level it seems to me that the expression necessarily merges with the function certainly at a very simple level, start/stop to make the machine go."
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,395.828,405.936,"--There's no question, Justice Kennedy, that there are certain menus and certain user interfaces that would be far too simple to pass the Feist test."
1995.94-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.659,413.979,"But it's more than creativity, sweat of the brow."
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,421.797,433.915,"--Well, if I may use the inelegant analogy of sweat, I believe that what the Feist case established is that not all sweat has equal impact under copyright law."
1995.94-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,459.155,466.13,What is the general rule that you apply in order to have us follow that and make that analysis and come out in your case?
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,468.423,469.235,Because--
1995.94-2003,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,469.235,470.964,--of the creativity--
1995.94-2003,0,27084,henry_b_gutman,,470.964,472.796,--Because it is--
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,1633.798,1649.656,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.665,1713.409,Is there any reason to think that Congress was of this view that was expressed by Judge Boudin?
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,1713.409,1715.34,"Yes, I think so, Your Honor."
1995.94-2003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.559,1769.175,"Well, it shows a narrowing certainly, but I would not think just the one citation you make means that Congress adopted the view the Judge Boudin expressed."
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,1769.175,1773.697,"Well, Judge Boudin had a variety of things to say in his opinion."
1995.94-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1859.37,1862.923,What are the legal labels we've used to express this?
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,1887.009,1887.6,"Yes, we would I think."
1995.94-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1891.914,1899.859,"I would just say it doesn't seem to me that the argument you've just made, which was a sensible one, is reflected in either of the two categories that I mentioned."
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,1915.092,1917.062,--I think that--
1995.94-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1917.062,1919.823,And I need to know what kind of labels I'm supposed to use to--
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,1919.823,1919.994,--Sure.
1995.94-2003,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1919.994,1921.426,--to reach that result.
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,1921.426,1921.566,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-2003,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1938.897,1944.991,"Mr. Reback, wouldn't that change the character and understanding of 102(b)?"
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,2005.369,2008.339,"--And I would argue in Baker v. Selden, Your Honor."
1995.94-2003,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2051.371,2054.054,"But even in Baker v. Selden, there was something there that was protected."
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,2056.047,2057.108,"--And so as there is here, Your Honor."
1995.94-2003,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.291,2090.371,That's exactly the question.
1995.94-2003,1,26014,gary_l_reback,,2145.06,2159.289,My response to that is that this case in many respects is an easier case than Baker v. Selden because in this case you have to use those words to run macros.
1995.94-2003,2,27084,henry_b_gutman,,3423.798,3425.239,Thank you.
1995.94-2003,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3466.887,3472.481,But doesn't the musical score do two things?
1995.94-2003,2,27084,henry_b_gutman,,3482.306,3491.111,"Well, it explains... in this case it explains or provides a means for someone to perform the work of art."
1995.94-2003,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3497.769,3500.302,The music is not a work of commercial utility.
1995.94-2003,2,27084,henry_b_gutman,,3500.302,3502.594,But that's not the standard.
1995.94-2003,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3502.594,3503.205,It isn't?
1995.94-2003,2,27084,henry_b_gutman,,3510.643,3516.637,Copyright has always provided protection to commercially useful works.
