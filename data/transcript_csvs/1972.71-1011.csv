1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.446,"We’ll hear arguments this morning in number 71-1011, Bronston against the United States."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,11.773,15.778,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,70.299,73.452,"The alleged, yes.[Attempt to laughter]"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,73.452,80.312,The hearing was in a Bankruptcy Court before a referee in bankruptcy.
1972.71-1011,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,279.232,282.446,Did the government know this-- the prosecution know this at the time?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,282.446,285.315,The time that they chose to indict?
1972.71-1011,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,285.315,288.767,"No, the time they questioned him?"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,288.767,292.26,I-- you mean whether the attorney for the creditor knew all this?
1972.71-1011,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,292.26,301.136,"No, the-- at this hearing, did the government-- at that time, did the government know that he had had an account there?"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,301.136,303.756,"I don’t know that, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1972.71-1011,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,306.158,306.297,I understand.
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,306.297,308.146,It was a private hearing.
1972.71-1011,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,308.146,310.215,"When did the government-- the government found out, but when did--"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,310.215,320.988,A creditor brought the information into the government about the bank account because Mr. Bronston had given his creditors a general waiver that they could go into any bank account.
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,347.4,353.302,"Well, you don’t suggest that this was not an evasive answer."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,358.437,362.238,-- you mean as to the question to the exercise of the prosecutor of discretion? Mr. Chief Justice--
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,362.238,362.981,"No, excuse me."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,365.275,370.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would say this, and I want to answer your question directly."
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,389.234,390.12,"Well, that’s why I put the question."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,390.12,390.745,Yes.
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,390.745,392.687,Is it an evasive answer?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,393.304,399.004,"No, I don’t say that it’s evasive, and I will get into that."
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,400.391,411.967,"Judge Lumbard thought it was, as I read his dissent, thought it was an evasive answer that should’ve put the questioner in search of more answers."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,411.967,417.52,Judge Lumbard proceeded on the assumption that the question was not ambiguous.
1972.71-1011,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.432,444.775,"Judge Lumbard’s theory, as I read his dissenting opinion was, that it was an unresponsive answer and a true statement."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,444.775,445.533,Correct.
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,447.207,454.444,"And, which should in turn have led the questioner to pursue it if they were thinking about a perjury proceeding."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,454.444,456.841,If he was interested in the account.
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.637,788.085,"Well, there’s no question the jury found that he knew he was telling a falsehood or answering the question falsely."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,788.085,790.897,"Mr. Justice White, the--"
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.897,800.054,And is it your point that even if the jury found that as like any other case where there shouldn’t have been-- there wasn’t enough evidence to go to the jury?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,800.054,817.342,"That’s correct, although, Mr. Justice White, I would probably prefer to phrase it in terms of the fact that the case on the evidence on the government’s evidence did not fall within the standard which we should set down for a criminal case of perjury."
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.342,817.52,Nevertheless--
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,817.52,818.698,It’s another way of putting the same.
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.698,826.322,"Nevertheless, the jury-- you don’t take any exception to the form of the instructions to the jury."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,826.322,827.62,Well--
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.62,828.439,Do you?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,828.439,830.667,We’re not raising that point on this appeal.
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.667,830.777,"No, you don’t."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,830.777,836.507,"But, the government did say at one point that the ambiguity issue was charged to the jury, and that’s not so."
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.489,853.824,"But the constructions are-- seem to appear to be wholly consistent with the statute, and they inquire the jury to find the elements of the offense under the statute."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,853.824,854.613,"Yes, that’s correct."
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.811,857.523,And the jury found them.
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,857.523,869.27,"The instructions were the judge charged to the contrary of our position on the question of a truthful answer and the jury, following that instruction, found--"
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.27,873.497,"So, the jury found the elements of the offense or they wouldn’t have--"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,873.497,874.375,That’s correct.
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.375,875.142,Assuming they followed the--
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,875.142,880.871,"That’s correct, assuming that the elements were correctly stated by the judge."
1972.71-1011,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.871,884.696,"But your point, nevertheless, is that the case should never have gone to the jury on these facts."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,884.696,886.509,Never have gone to the jury.
1972.71-1011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.325,936.419,Mr. Elsen.
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,936.419,936.584,Yes?
1972.71-1011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.584,943.064,Am I right in thinking that both Judge Oaks and Judge Lumbard concluded the question was not ambiguous?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,943.064,943.924,That is correct.
1972.71-1011,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1017.921,1018.925,What page?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1018.925,1023.548,"That’s at page 2 of our reply brief, Mr. Justice Powell."
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1097.209,1103.408,"Well, what do you say the first question was directed at and what do you say the witness thought it was directed at?"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1103.408,1107.917,What I say the first question is directed at is bank accounts.
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1107.917,1108.122,Whose bank accounts?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1108.122,1114.789,"And, bank accounts could be the property of the company, which was the subject of the examination, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1114.789,1115.273,Do you think it--
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1115.273,1116.467,Or the individual.
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1116.467,1118.699,Do you think the first question was ambiguous?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1118.699,1120.672,"Yes, indeed, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1123.084,1127.169,I guess you say that because of the context--
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1127.169,1127.756,"Yes, this is--"
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.756,1131.901,How the inquiry in the bankruptcy proceeding involving the corporation.
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1131.901,1132.667,Correct.
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.667,1133.81,That’s the premise.
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1133.81,1134.931,That is quite correct.
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1138.243,1139.711,And what do you say the fact was?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1146.635,1148.454,The corporation no longer had a bank account.
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1148.454,1149.395,"But did he, at the time--"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1149.395,1150.436,He no longer--
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1150.436,1160.644,"At the time-- so, whether he took it as addressed to him personally or is it-- or “you” meaning the corporation, in either instance, the fact was that neither had a bank account at that time."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1160.874,1161.31,That’s quite correct.
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1161.31,1162.474,"So, that was truthful and that was--"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1162.474,1172.813,"That was truthful, but it also does not establish a context of inquiry to personal bank accounts."
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1185.683,1186.55,"May I ask, Mr. Elsen?"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1186.55,1187.076,Yes.
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1187.076,1202.42,"Would you say that-- I gather your basic premise is that, in this series of questions, whenever the interrogator uses the word “you,” the interrogator thought to be that Mr. Bronston understood “you” to be the corporation."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1202.42,1206.295,"I don’t believe that I have to go that far, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1206.295,1210.72,"I see, because I was wondering about the last question “have you any nominees?”"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1210.72,1211.844,"Well, companies could have nominees."
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1211.844,1212.295,"They have nominees, too?"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1212.295,1227.395,"As a matter of fact, it’s a common practice of foreign corporations to use nominees in Swiss Banks in order to open up the-- an account without having to comply with Swiss Banking law for corporate resolutions and the like."
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1248.994,1251.185,"He took the stand, didn’t he?"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1251.185,1251.846,At the trial?
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1251.846,1251.992,Yes.
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1251.992,1252.647,He did not take the stand.
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1252.647,1253.407,He did not?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1253.407,1259.216,He did not take the stand.
1972.71-1011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.521,1359.547,Does the referee have the sort of contempt power that a District Court would have in the case of a genuinely obdurate witness?
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1359.547,1360.286,"Oh, yes."
1972.71-1011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1363.858,1367.198,"To put him on the spot and say, “either answer the question or--"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1367.198,1368.608,"He did direct it, yes."
1972.71-1011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.418,1376.544,"But if he-- if the man does it in response of the referee’s question, then the referee must seek the aid of the District Court."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1376.544,1380.473,"I believe that’s the law, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.609,1439.165,"What was the significance of whether or not he personally had a bank account, what you say, four years earlier or something?"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1439.921,1442.131,Why do we concede materiality?
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1442.131,1442.627,Yes.
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1442.627,1455.803,"That’s really-- we concede materiality because the law is extensive that, in a bankruptcy, we will not dispute the fact that you could’ve asked about-- just about anything that he had done during a period."
1972.71-1011,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1455.803,1458.544,"I mean, was the estate in any way disadvantaged?"
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1458.544,1460.12,No.
1972.71-1011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.619,1626.055,"And yet, certainly, if it were a civil fraud action, this type of answer would support a judgment for civil fraud."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1626.055,1632.426,"I would not concede that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I would draw this distinction and the ALI draws this."
1972.71-1011,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1647.124,1652.794,"No, but if I’m interrogating you orally about what kind of a stock it is, I certainly do ask the questions."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1652.794,1692.941,"Well, the normal civil fraud situation arises out of representations where the actor controls the representations, and the American Law Institute in the Model Penal Code does say that there should be a stricter standard for that type of situation than for the interrogation situation where counsel was in the position to frame the issues, to ask the next question, and to pursue and I would say, though I certainly do not say that this is a fraud particularly in the light of the nature of the questioning here and the nature of the economic interests that were involved here where there was indeed no motive."
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1779.756,1785.618,"You have only two minutes of it left, so you better make that judgment."
1972.71-1011,0,41285,sheldon_h_elsen,,1785.618,1792.884,"Well, then I will simply say this."
1972.71-1011,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1860.7,1861.152,Very well.
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1862.713,1865.972,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1932.578,1951.637,"Would you say, Mr. Frey, that the majority of the Second Circuit in this case read this answer to question number two as though he had said “no, but my company did”?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1951.637,1953.374,"Yes, I think that this--"
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1953.374,1956.388,"You have to read that “no” into it, don’t you?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1956.388,1963.996,"Well, I think that’s true. We don’t have to read that in as a matter of law because this is an issue that, as I’m trying to point out here, the jury did resolve."
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1963.996,1971.273,The Second Circuit is treating the answer given as though-- do you agree that that’s the way they’re treating it?
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1971.273,1973.909,"Yes, I do agree, Your Honor."
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1974.836,1978.867,"And you say that’s the necessary implication, the inevitable implication."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1978.867,1990.257,"That’s what the jury found, because the judge instructed them apart from the question of understanding that they must find that he made a statement which, when considered in the entire context, was a false statement."
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.756,2022.844,"Well, that’s no-- really no final answer, is it?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2022.844,2027.979,"Well, there is a question of course as to whether the jury could properly find that under the evidence in the--"
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.979,2029.161,The jury finds lots of things.
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2030.927,2031.533,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.533,2034.541,Even though the instructions were proper.
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2034.541,2036.033,That may be true if an error is--
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.033,2037.365,"Well, it was, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2037.365,2039.602,"Yes, if there’s an error in submitting the case to the jury."
1972.71-1011,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2271.482,2281.867,"At that point, Mr. Frey, what could he possibly have gained by the type of answer he gave if it were perjurious?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2281.867,2296.69,"Well, first of all, he deflected inquiry into this account within-- through which $180,000 have passed which he used for mixed business and personal purposes according to the testimony at the trial in the perjury case."
1972.71-1011,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2313.052,2318.856,"What I gather, Mr. Frey, that certainly this bankruptcy estate suffered not at all about anything that he said."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2318.856,2321.761,"Well, it hasn’t been proved that he suffered by it."
1972.71-1011,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2329.925,2340.148,"Well, I thought all of the facts regarding those accounts: what was in them, how long have they been opened, when they were closed, that they all will finally be developed at the perjury trial."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2344.434,2351.535,The personal account ledger was introduced and there was evidence regarding some of the transactions.
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.766,2489.532,"What’s part of his argument, I take it, is that even if the witness clearly understood it, all they did was penciled the lawyer."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2489.532,2489.725,Well--
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.725,2497.892,And the sense that there on-- a lot of witnesses are just not quick as some lawyers. They don’t know where the lawyer is going with questions.
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2508.898,2509.085,Well--
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.085,2522.662,"And your argument has to be that anytime somebody gives an evasive answer, a jury is entitled to find that by negative--that the negative implication was that he really intended to answer the question falsely."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2522.662,2526.102,"No, I don’t believe my argument has to be that at all."
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.642,2533.989,"Well, it does if you-- anytime the jury found it, you would sustain it."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2533.989,2534.912,"No, I would not."
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.803,2556.592,"No, but if he went to the jury and the jury found that, what would you say?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2556.592,2567.863,"No, I would say it could not go to the jury in that case, and the reason it could not go to the jury is that the answer “my daughter went to school in Switzerland” does not contain any implication about bank accounts one way or another."
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.328,2611.7,"But the essence that you responded to there, suggests that you can be found guilty of the criminal act of perjury by implication."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2611.7,2622.09,"Yes, indeed, by-- if your statement contains with it an implication, as many statements do."
1972.71-1011,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2659.112,2665.598,"Mr. Frey, I don’t know that it makes any difference, but were these questions asked by the referee in bankruptcy or by counsel for one of the claimants?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2665.598,2673.045,They were asked by counsel for one of the principal creditors of the corporation.
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.214,2712.894,"Yes, but that excuse is pretty easily-- what they’re going to do-- not going to ask another question."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2712.894,2720.192,"Well, it’s easy for us to stand here now knowing about the existence of the Geneva account and looking back at the matter."
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.192,2728.85,"I know, but it’s-- it didn’t-- you don’t have to know that to wonder why the lawyer didn’t ask another question at the time."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2728.85,2739.129,"Well, because I think the lawyer understood petitioner’s answer, the way the jury understood petitioner’s answer, to deny the Geneva account and, therefore, was fruitless to ask another question."
1972.71-1011,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.773,2757.463,"But, Mr. Frey, I think to most everybody who has practiced law your first reaction to that set of questions is if you had been the examining attorney and got an answer you liked, you would’ve said “yes, but how about your own accounts?”"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2766.979,2769.822,"Well, I don’t believe that’s so."
1972.71-1011,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2800.329,2809.661,"In bankruptcy cases, when-- or some thought perjury has occurred, when-- who makes the decision to prosecute?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2809.661,2811.478,I think the United States Attorney would make this decision.
1972.71-1011,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2811.478,2815.026,This isn’t something that has to come to the Department of Justice?
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2815.026,2817.276,I’m not certain of that.
1972.71-1011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2828.225,2835.041,Isn’t it also true that in a bankruptcy hearing it’s a complete fishing expedition as being one had?
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2835.041,2835.834,That is true.
1972.71-1011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2836.198,2841.71,And that’s in light of his lawyer who could’ve asked him any question following this line of questioning.
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2841.71,2845.431,"Well, this wasn’t just any line of questioning, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1972.71-1011,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2849.342,2856.0,"Well, I’m saying there was no restriction that toll on the lawyer getting the facts if he knew how to get them."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2856.0,2856.579,"Now, that’s true."
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.506,2944.159,"Well, that would be very persuasive to me if this were a verdict in a civil case, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested, a verdict in a civil case for fraud and the jury then return a verdict treating this as fraudulent answer, a dishonest answer."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2947.886,2956.539,"Well, I think if this were a criminal fraud case it would also be true that you will look at the context of the statement, and we have cited cases in our brief to that effect."
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2956.962,2976.408,"-- putting it in another way that I think an Appellate Court would have very little difficulty affirming a judgment in a civil fraud case with this structure of questions and answers, but that doesn’t carry you all the way in a criminal case, does it?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2976.408,2981.342,"No, I’m not suggesting that automatically the same policy would apply to perjury."
1972.71-1011,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3044.846,3051.512,"Or you could start out with a good question in the first place, “name everybody who was at the meeting.”"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3051.512,3052.659,"Well, you could do that."
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.866,3097.869,"Well, that’s what you say but it may be quite true that he had thoroughly intended to conceal the fact that was asked."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3105.412,3111.342,"Well, it depends on how he does it of course, and only if he conceals it by a false statement would it be perjury."
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3135.01,3147.89,"Well, I suppose part of the problem is that, on the day the creditor’s counsel was asking these questions, he wasn’t thinking about a perjury case in a Federal District Court, a criminal prosecution."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3151.576,3153.059,You think petitioner wasn’t thinking about it?
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3153.059,3155.802,"No, I said the creditor’s counsel."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3155.802,3156.987,"That’s probably true, he wasn’t--"
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3156.987,3159.164,The creditor’s counsel was focused on general inquiry.
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3169.175,3186.094,"That’s true, but he-- here, he was dealing with a witness who had come in, as an effect, a plaintiff asking relief of the Court for his cooperation, asking the Bankruptcy Court and asking his creditors to participate in arrangement."
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3256.872,3258.642,They may not be free to do that.
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3267.795,3272.244,If the lawyer sees that he’ been-- that he is or may have been lied to.
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.244,3276.149,"Well, it wouldn’t take much in this case, would it?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3276.149,3289.282,"Well, I think that, again, I have to come back to what I think the-- what the jury found petitioner’s statement to mean which was that he had already denied the existence of this account."
1972.71-1011,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.972,3297.192,"I agree the jury must have found that, that he intended to tell a lie."
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3297.192,3318.968,"In my example with the persons at the meeting where the answer “Smith and Brown,” which I believe petitioner concedes as perjurious in that context, although I think Judge Lumbard would not find it to be, you would agree that all you have to do is ask anyone else and you could’ve bring out the rest of that information."
1972.71-1011,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3413.128,3414.609,"What footnote said it, Mr. Frey?"
1972.71-1011,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3414.609,3422.681,"That is at the cert petition at appendix, page A8, footnote 4."
1972.71-1011,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3521.027,3523.499,"Thank you, Mr. Frey."
