1965.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.979,"Research Incorporated et al., petitioner versus Edward J. Brenner, Commissioner of Patents."
1965.57,0,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,11.571,16.228,"Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1965.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,698.654,700.572,"Excuse me, may I ask --"
1965.57,0,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,700.572,700.977,Yes sir.
1965.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,700.977,706.356,Do you consider subdivision e of 102 to have any relevancy to this question?
1965.57,0,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,706.356,723.297,"Your Honor, I definitely do not and as a matte of fact in my brief I referred to a decision, a recent decision by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals which said expressly that Section 102 (e) had nothing -- I'm sorry that was one 102 (b), it had nothing whatever to do with 103."
1965.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,728.244,742.168,"Well on the face of it, it shall be entitled with the patent unless the invention was described in an application for patent by another filed before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent."
1965.57,0,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,744.56,747.29,"Well, that would be true Your Honor."
1965.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,799.539,808.265,So your answer is that it does not fit this case because the invention involved in the Regis patent was not --
1965.57,0,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,808.265,808.795,In Wallace.
1965.57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,808.795,809.635,In Wallace.
1965.57,0,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,809.635,810.398,That's correct Your Honor.
1965.57,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.398,813.594,And Regis wouldn't infringe either Wallace or Carlson?
1965.57,0,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,813.594,815.798,Neither Wallace or Carlson.
1965.57,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1049.596,1051.336,Mr. Doolittle.
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1051.336,1055.677,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1147.368,1149.16,"Could you speak a little louder please, Mr. Doolittle."
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1149.16,1151.884,Yes Your Honor.
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1183.236,1185.962,Did the courts below used the word insignificant?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1185.962,1187.363,"No, they didn't Your Honor."
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1198.819,1201.229,"That's saying the essential questions, isn't it?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1201.229,1215.829,"Well, Your Honor it isn't in the sense that an obvious advance is an unpatentable advance, and you have to make a qualification on that general concept in order to come out the way petitioners would have you come up."
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1233.301,1238.528,"Not a -- that's not a patentable departure from the prior art, it's not patentable to something that is, is?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1238.528,1243.749,"But it is a patentable advance, it is an unpatentable advance over a prior patent."
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1255.638,1258.565,Well -- that might be the other one end something else?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1258.565,1263.589,"Well, it is the something else that makes it obvious, but you're right it is the combination of the two."
1965.57,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1357.149,1358.815,"Mr. Doolittle, I'm --"
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1358.815,1359.267,Oh!
1965.57,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1359.983,1360.607,I beg your pardon.
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1360.607,1361.637,Go right ahead.
1965.57,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1361.637,1372.493,I'm not sure that I quite understand whether your statement of petitioner's position is in fact the petitioner's position.
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1419.02,1419.276,"Well, Your Honor --"
1965.57,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1419.276,1421.278,I'm not sure that I have --
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1421.278,1421.89,As I understand --
1965.57,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1421.89,1427.842,"-- if I'm correct about this, but I did get a different impression of the petitioner's position?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1427.842,1453.845,"As I understand the petitioner's position is and this -- what I'm stating is not only the petitioner's position but the government's position as well, that the Wallace application, the Wallace patent did not fully disclose the Regis disclosure, and therefore, Section 102 (e) is not strictly speaking applicable."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1512.596,1512.733,"No, go right ahead."
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1512.733,1516.477,"I thought you had a question, I'm sorry."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1757.275,1765.63,Was there enough disclosure of the Wallace patent to make the advance obvious to -- of this --
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1765.63,1783.847,"Well, as the examiner put it, there was in light of the Carlson patent that is the -- those are the words that the patent examiner used and that those essentially are the words that for purposes of this case, the petitioner has agreed adequately described the situation, yes Your Honor."
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.847,1788.596,"That was no disclosure -- that is no public disclosure of the Wallace patent, was it?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1788.596,1789.964,No public disclosure.
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.964,1790.978,It was secret?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1790.978,1793.29,It was secret until it issued.
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1793.29,1795.263,"Well, that was I was referring to."
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1800.767,1802.136,As of the time --
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1802.136,1804.146,-- that bear upon the obviousness?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1804.146,1807.821,As of the time that the Regis application was filed.
1965.57,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1811.697,1812.613,"Yes, that I --"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1812.613,1833.221,"So that that much of the -- that much of the art was familiar, but and was public knowledge but it is a fact as to which there is no serious question that as of the time that the Regis application was filed the disclosures of the Wallace patent were secret."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1841.389,1865.022,"Now, if I may interrupt you just once more, how does that square with the statement of the examiner that you just mentioned that there was sufficient disclosure of the Wallace patent when taken in connection with the Carlson patent to put them on notice?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1865.022,1881.881,"Well, of course, I might say as of the time that the examiner made that statement, the Wallace patent had already issued, but of course the question is not whether or not the petitioner or to say whether or not the applicant was on notice."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1889.493,1905.042,I thought that the prior art did in fact form general knowledge in the knowledge of people through publications or to the patents that this was a prior art?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1905.042,1921.193,"Well, we agree that as described in Section 102 (a) that does generally describe the public knowledge of which patentees are noticed where they actually know of it or not."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1921.193,1921.495,Yes.
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1921.495,1947.793,"But we also contend that the patent laws require that in this instance material that could not have been known to the patentee, to the applicant is chargeable against him in order that dual patent is not issued on essentially the same material or a material that does not differ in any patentable way."
1965.57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1968.646,1970.841,That would be by force of subdivision (e).
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1970.841,1973.18,"102 (e), that's right Your Honor."
1965.57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1973.402,1983.787,And that's the -- I'm just wondering how that can face that there is an explicit (e) that would cover that situation and how that's fortunate because --
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,1983.787,2001.772,"Well, I'm simply saying that under the way in which the patent laws are set up basically as I was really about to develop, Section 103 we believe incorporates the references of Section 102."
1965.57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2051.821,2055.446,What was the date of Judge Hand's --
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2055.446,2057.982,1945 Your Honor.
1965.57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2057.982,2059.219,That question states it.
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2059.219,2062.242,Yes sir.
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.242,2071.33,Do you need to make this point about 102 (e) or why does 102 (a) get to as far as you need to go?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2071.33,2078.145,Because 102 (a) is generally considered as covering things that were publicly known.
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.145,2086.947,"Well, I don't know why it should be when it says the invention is known or used by others."
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2097.883,2098.568,In fact of course --
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.568,2106.025,"I can have a trade secret -- secret process and they're using it and knowing it, nobody else knows about it."
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2106.025,2106.524,"Well, of course --"
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.524,2112.007,"And I know why that wouldn't be a decent part of the prior art though, wouldn't it?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2112.007,2115.214,"In fact, of course we don't -- we don't rely on 102 (e)."
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.609,2128.965,But I don't -- but you're saying that the reference of prior art in 103 includes 102 (e).
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2139.408,2146.458,"Well, the known part of it of course, would not be satisfied with the co-pending patent."
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.629,2155.501,"Well, the invitation was known -- it was certainly was known by the people --"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2155.501,2161.728,It was known by the people who actually filed the application that's right Your Honor.
1965.57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2167.1,2168.539,One of it is relying primary on --
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2168.539,2174.533,"Well, on 103 as incorporating co-pending patents which are covered in 102 (e) specifically."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2174.533,2177.833,"That means, you do not rely on the other side too?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2177.833,2180.52,We do not Your Honor.
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2180.52,2195.093,"Cases are all against you on 102 (a), a good reason you don't rely on it much?[Laughter]"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2195.093,2216.209,"Now, as I began to say to Mr. Justice Brennan Your Honors as of 1952 the decisions of this Court had established without any question that on the issue of obviousness co-pending patents were available references."
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2403.814,2404.664,Mr. Doolittle?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2404.664,2406.307,Yes Your Honor.
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.307,2412.023,What if Wallace hadn't filed for a patent at all?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2454.657,2455.249,Well Wallace --
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.249,2457.362,You would the same question --
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2457.362,2467.881,Wallace would certainly be in a position to contend of course that he was the first inventor and to get an application -- get a patent granted on that account.
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.803,2483.527,"I'm just wondering what are the secret processes, the trade secrets that are being use prior to this -- or part of the prior art secret processes that someone is using as part of the prior art."
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2483.527,2485.951,I'm afraid I don't have the answer to that Your Honor.
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.951,2488.938,It should be a similar question shouldn't it?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2488.938,2497.663,"Well, certainly in the sense of whether or not one has to be aware of the prior art it would present --"
1965.57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.663,2499.166,Or even have an opportunity to be --
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2499.166,2504.398,"Yes, yes Your Honor, that's right."
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2504.398,2507.812,I didn't quite understand your answer.
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2507.812,2525.494,"Well, I simply said that -- that the questions are similar in the sense that in both situations there is some prior art or some prior use or what have you of which the applicant would have no way of discovering."
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.494,2528.434,"Yes, but the questions are entirely dissimilar are they not?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2536.568,2537.881,We require no application.
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2541.077,2543.426,And as it refers to 102 (e)?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2543.426,2545.385,Yes Your Honor.
1965.57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2545.385,2551.393,"So I still don't understand, I don't understand what answer you gave to this question."
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2551.393,2575.124,"Well, the specific answer I gave was as far as a secret process I express my doubt that on the issue of patentability other than determining who was the first inventor I express my doubt that that would preclude the issuance of a patent."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2575.124,2591.376,Without regard to what the cases might hold in this field isn't your argument -- doesn't your argument give us all that they started to viewed to the meaning of obvious?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2591.376,2593.916,Not at all Your Honor.
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2593.916,2603.131,"How would it be obvious to a man if he had no way, if there was no possible way that he could find out what the art was?"
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2603.131,2608.135,"Well, of course it would not be obvious to him since he couldn't be aware of it."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2608.135,2609.289,Or to anyone?
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2609.289,2628.029,"As I have said, the patent laws operate in terms of objective advances in the art, not in terms of what a person in and of himself could know at any given time and I've given a number of examples in which the patent law resembles exactly that."
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2656.445,2663.041,"That must be on a -- I would think it might be another theory, but not on the theory that it's obvious."
1965.57,1,29930,j_william_doolittle,,2663.041,2667.179,It's not on a theory that it's obvious but on a theory that's identical.
1965.57,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2818.849,2819.654,Mr. Dodds.
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2819.654,2821.323,"Your Honors, I would have a few minutes."
1965.57,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2890.954,2896.114,What you're saying is that 102 has the number of conditions under which you cannot get a patent issued.
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2896.114,2896.591,Yes Your Honor.
1965.57,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2896.591,2898.884,"And 103 just adds still another one, is that what you're saying?"
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2898.884,2901.149,Exactly the point Mr. Justice Brennan.
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.258,2915.872,"Well, what do you think the prior art means when Congress that referred the prior art when an invention has to be none obvious over the prior art, what was the reference of prior art?"
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2915.872,2921.292,Prior art and the decisions which we have discussed and analyzed in our brief that all of the --
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.292,2925.19,"Why didn't Congress mean by those words, what the cases said it meant --"
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2925.19,2926.292,Because it's precisely right --
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.292,2926.66,At the time --
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2926.66,2932.717,"And in this case of Wallace it said precisely that prior art means what was publicly known, it's that general fund of technical probably --"
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2932.717,2937.942,You don't think there were any decisions prior to 1952 that said a co-pending patent was part of the prior art?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2937.942,2939.059,Unfortunately there weren't.
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.555,2957.219,You don't think Detrola is really relative to this case?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2957.219,2957.695,Pardon?
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.695,2959.976,You don't think Detrola really has any bearing on this?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,2959.976,2961.936,I think Detrola has no bearing on the case.
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.351,3016.544,Wasn't the regular practice of the Patent Office prior to 1952 to include co-pending patents in the prior art?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3016.544,3017.218,"No, Your Honor."
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.903,3020.088,The government is wrong in saying this?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3020.088,3024.491,We think the Patent Office is wrong but they did -- the Patent Office even before the 1952 Act.
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.491,3028.158,And the Patent Office doesn't know what they were doing in 1952?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3028.158,3030.055,They have maintained the 1952 Act.
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.274,3037.406,And it did before -- and it did before 1952?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3037.406,3041.973,"And they did before 1952, yes, Your Honor."
1965.57,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3188.45,3190.52,"Now, Mr. Doolittle disagrees with you I think."
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3193.172,3197.919,That is definitely -- absolutely no authority or no logic for that.
1965.57,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3198.645,3201.579,Did I misunderstand his contention do you think?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3201.579,3202.0,I beg your pardon?
1965.57,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3202.0,3203.273,Do you think I misunderstood Mr. Doolittle's --
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3203.273,3205.167,"No, I think you did understand that position, I agree with you but --"
1965.57,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3205.167,3205.654,I thought I misunderstood it --
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3205.654,3207.31,But we hardly disagree with it.
1965.57,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3207.31,3207.603,"Yes, I --"
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3207.603,3214.065,The point is the claims that we're talking about here and the Regis which are before this Court for decision.
1965.57,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3260.378,3273.134,Is there an area -- is there an area in which a perspective user of this invention would have to obtain a license from both Wallace and Regis?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3273.134,3277.317,"Very definitely, yes Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.57,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3297.665,3313.225,"And a licensee, a person wanting to use the invention or wanting a practice in the field of the art would in some area have to obtain a license from the two of them or perhaps three?"
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3313.225,3329.591,Earlier and perhaps others and that is the general principle in the patent law that later improvement patent is always subject to any earlier broader dominating patents which may form a part of the invention of the later patent.
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.591,3331.923,As a matter of fact is that true in this case?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3331.923,3332.621,I'm sorry.
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.621,3335.477,As a matter of fact is that true in this case?
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3335.477,3336.263,It's certainly true in this.
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.263,3342.269,That Regis will have to have a -- if he gets the patent he will still have to have a license from Wallace.
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3342.269,3343.832,That is true in general I might --
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.832,3345.527,"I know, but in this case."
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3345.527,3353.419,"Well, frankly Your Honor I haven't studied the claims of Wallace and Carlson to see just what they were claiming."
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.362,3360.692,Yes.
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3360.692,3366.84,"Sometimes, but assuming if those men had patent claim with their patent -- with their invention."
1965.57,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3366.84,3388.567,"Well it could be anyway that Regis doesn't get -- that Regis' invention is obvious and non patentable or well, it could be that he would get his -- that he would get his patent because his invention was not obvious and still he wouldn't have to have a license from Wallace."
1965.57,2,34375,laurence_b_dodds,,3388.567,3404.194,"It could be, but if Wallace and Carlson properly claimed their inventions Regis would require licenses from the owners of what was the patent in order to practice his invention, but not the converse as the counsel for respondent urges."
1965.57,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3404.877,3409.038,Very well.
