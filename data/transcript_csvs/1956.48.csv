1956.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.817,"Number 48, United States of America for the Benefit and on Behalf of Harry Sherman, et al., Petitioners, versus Donald G.Carter."
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,13.125,15.348,If the Court please.
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,327.546,328.219,"Now, are you going --"
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,328.219,328.725,Yes.
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,328.725,331.184,-- are you going to tell us just who brought this suit?
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,331.184,333.639,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,333.785,337.637,"As a part -- part of the contract, a part of your statement in regard to the contract."
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,337.637,338.185,"I'm sorry, sir."
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,338.185,341.863,"As a part of your statement in regard to the contract, how they got the right to bring the suits."
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,341.863,345.082,"Yes, I will turn to that immediately, Your Honor."
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,345.082,346.143,"No, no, don't let me interrupt you (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,346.143,353.053,"Well, that -- in -- in the logical course of my argument just this day, I'll reach that."
1956.48,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,659.312,661.862,Did -- did Carter sign it on this?
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,661.862,684.931,"Yes, Your Honor, as appears from the complaint, it is pled that Carter was, at the time of the work that was performed, a member of the Home Builders Association of Sacramento."
1956.48,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,687.594,689.158,Where -- where are you reading now?
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,689.158,689.825,I'm sorry?
1956.48,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,689.825,690.968,Where are you reading?
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,690.968,716.916,"I'm reading from the page 21 of the pamphlet, Your Honor, and I will get the reference in the transcript to the allegation but I simply direct the attention of the Court at this point to the fact that the Associated General Contract -- I mean, Home Builders of Sacramento appear as a signatory association to the trust agreement."
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,790.09,796.662,"Now, I don't -- and how was it that Carter gave authority to the -- Associated Home Builders to go into this?"
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,796.662,809.587,"Simply by his membership, the bylaws of some of the associations provide for -- give expressed authority to the association to represent it in collective bargaining."
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,809.587,813.792,And this association the Home Builders of Sacramento?
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,813.792,820.886,"I can't state to the Court that that is the fact, Your Honor, because we have alleged the authority."
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,831.234,833.547,So you -- you depend on your allegation?
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,833.547,842.157,"We depend upon our allegation and the fact that for the purposes of the summary judgment, it was admitted by the surety and no issue --"
1956.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,842.157,846.409,Does the -- does the surety admit the collective-bargaining agreement?
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,846.409,849.221,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,849.221,856.05,"Now, what about the Article II, Section 3, does that have any effect on it on the trust agreement?"
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,857.31,858.526,Section 3.
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,858.526,864.902,-- page 3.
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,864.902,876.115,"As explained in the brief, the reason for that provision was to avoid a holding -- shall I read it, Your Honor or --"
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,876.115,877.251,If you please --
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,877.251,877.714,The --
1956.48,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,877.714,878.654,--I haven't found that.
1956.48,0,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,878.654,878.998,Yes.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,1988.915,1991.489,May it please the Court.
1956.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2016.244,2017.326,"Where are you reading this, Mr. --"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2017.326,2020.827,"I'm reading from the transcript, page 18 and 19."
1956.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2020.827,2022.364,Thank you.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2022.364,2034.601,The condition of this obligation is such that whereas the principle entered into a certain contract with the Government numbered and dated as shown above and heard to attest.
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2108.429,2112.675,Was there a trustee according -- trustee and bankruptcy?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2112.675,2116.419,"Trustee and bankruptcy is not a party to the action, Your Honor."
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2116.419,2117.309,He's not in there?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2117.309,2121.268,"He was not joined, although the --"
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2121.268,2123.507,So we -- we have only the insurance company?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2123.507,2126.801,We have only the surety involved here.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2143.594,2146.26,"Mr. Dinkelspiel, it isn't clear to me."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2169.18,2172.027,It -- both problems are involved.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2172.027,2176.31,"And now, would you deal with the latter one too and show what difference it makes?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2176.31,2178.015,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2259.441,2263.567,"No, but the second part that I'd like to have light shed on."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2272.803,2273.068,Now --
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2273.068,2289.053,"What I want to know is indulgent sense.Would it make any difference if this were as I suggested a minute ago, a class suit on behalf of the specific laborer to work on this project."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2289.053,2300.245,"The answer to the first question is that if the trustees are not suing on behalf of or as a class suit, they are simply suing here as trustees of a health and welfare fund."
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2300.245,2304.852,"Well, I have -- I have made myself interested to this."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2347.732,2348.676,"Yes, there would be a difference, Your Honor."
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2348.676,2350.512,That has found that but if he --
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2350.512,2365.848,"Yes, because first of all, it would be in my reading of the trust agreement, ""No right in the individual laborer to bring such an action for unpaid employer contributions, which are the subject of this suit."""
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2412.718,2417.011,Is that an equal rights under the -- what right is regarded under the Miller Act?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2417.011,2423.493,"And under the Miller Act, his right would be to wages which were not paid to him."
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2423.493,2426.665,"Well, then has anybody any right to sue for these contributions?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2426.665,2433.655,The trustees of the health and welfare fund very definitely have the right to sue the contractor.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2445.235,2452.243,You're merely arguing here that as -- as the surety -- that that the restricted obligation of the surety does not include this.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2452.243,2465.441,It does not apply to this agreement and I think the -- the terms of the fund and the construction contract argue that very persuasively.
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2465.441,2466.852,"Well, am -- am I wrong?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2484.536,2486.216,The agreement --
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2486.216,2491.211,And not between Carter and the welfare fund.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2491.211,2493.098,"No, there -- there were two agreements."
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2496.887,2498.879,That was what I'm speaking of.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2498.879,2501.296,-- and a collective -- and the union.
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2501.296,2510.555,"Well now, is that collective-bargaining agreement sued, an agreement that Carter the employer, would pay into this fund?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2510.555,2517.897,It -- it provided that they would set up a fund in the future as a matter of interest.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2540.739,2541.457,May I -- may --
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2541.457,2545.961,"Well, Carter -- Carter never -- excuse me."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2549.787,2550.873,Carter was the employer.
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2550.873,2558.746,"Carter never himself signed an agreement with the union, paid this money into the fund?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2558.746,2563.012,"Well, only through his employer group."
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2564.469,2564.959,It's not an individual contract.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2564.959,2567.124,It was an industry-wide contract.
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2567.124,2576.029,And you raise no question about his being a member of the employer group and having agreed to -- to do whatever the employer group contract called for?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2576.029,2583.219,"No, for the purpose of the motion for summary judgment, we assumed that he -- that there was authority to bind him --"
1956.48,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2583.219,2585.749,He's not obligated to the employer group?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2585.749,2587.347,-- to make the payment.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2587.347,2593.831,"This was the bond given to carry out the requirements of the Miller Act, is that right?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2593.831,2594.671,Yes.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2594.671,2603.713,"So, then the Miller Act -- the requirements of the Miller Act are at least in prior included in this fund, are they not?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2603.713,2603.899,"Yes, that's right."
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2603.899,2609.17,I mean the purpose for which the bond is given is to be associated from the Miller Act.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2613.636,2613.897,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2613.897,2623.572,"Is that -- now, what is, as you understand it, the requirements of the Miller Act, as to the kind of the bond or the scope of the bond to be given by Carter."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2623.572,2623.696,Yes.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2623.696,2625.849,And I understand to be the association.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2625.849,2641.225,"Yes, the bond must be given to provide that people or persons who have furnished labor as provided in the construction agreement will be paid in full."
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2673.928,2679.97,"I put him to one side, as what you've said a little a while ago that the trust agreement followed."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2679.97,2680.2,Yes.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2680.2,2685.034,The agreement came later than the surety bond.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2742.67,2745.755,I think that the answer to that is two-fold.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2795.75,2806.76,"Because the bond -- because the bond may have it all for the voluntarily assumption of obligation but you say it doesn't, as a matter of law, cover anything except the terms of the contract agreement."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2806.76,2807.785,"That's right, Your Honor."
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2807.785,2816.965,"And therefore, you have to go to the contract agreement to see what it is that the laborers supply -- the material men supply that you underwrote."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2816.965,2818.834,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2818.834,2830.013,"Mr. Dinkelspiel, I understood you to say that the trustees could sue the contractor for -- for these 7 1/2 cents an hour."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2830.013,2830.732,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2830.732,2833.015,What gave birth to that right?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2833.015,2843.357,"The trust agreement itself provides that, that the trustees are the persons who may sue to enforce the counter payment and the contribution."
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2843.357,2849.808,"But the trust agreement is based on some other right, isn't it?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2857.241,2861.169,By virtue of the contract obligation.
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2861.169,2865.532,"Well, but -- but isn't there is something before that?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2868.962,2871.301,"No, not necessarily."
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2871.301,2871.637,But what would it --
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2871.637,2872.947,The contribution --
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2872.947,2876.616,What couldn't before if it wasn't for the labor of these men?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2876.616,2882.5,It's for the welfare of -- of the employees in the industry as a whole.
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2882.627,2893.39,And what gives them the right -- what gives him the right to collect that -- that welfare fund?Is it not the -- the labor that's been performed by these men?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2893.39,2898.436,The contribution was measured by the hours of labor.
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2926.062,2934.881,"Let's assume that it was, wouldn't it still be -- wouldn't it still be -- depend upon the labor that these men had performed?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2934.881,2937.468,"It -- it was measured by the labor, yes."
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2942.525,2962.523,"Well then, if it -- if it was based upon the labor that these men performed, would it not come within Section 2 (a) which says, “Every person who has furnished labor in respect of which a payment bond is furnished and who has not been paid in full therefore shall have the right?”"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,2962.523,2984.458,"Not necessarily because as we pointed out in our brief, these men working in the industry might not receive ultimately any -- any benefit from these contributions."
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3012.943,3017.993,"If they had become injured on the job, they would have received benefits, would they not?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3017.993,3020.073,"No, not necessarily."
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3023.559,3033.111,"Well, no -- and well, suppose they had some of the things -- some of the eventualities that -- that this fund was set up for, occurred while they were working."
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3035.809,3045.669,If they had complied with the rules of the trustee that they had worked for six months and had contributed 400 hours.
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3045.669,3046.445,Yes.
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3046.445,3052.375,"Now -- and interestingly enough, those rules are set up by the trustees."
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3081.71,3096.21,"And does the fact that they don't -- most of them would not get any benefits because the eventualities wouldn't arise, mean that they had not received any benefits from that agreement?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3112.343,3113.07,No question with that.
1956.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3113.07,3117.981,And -- and doesn't that protection -- isn't that protection a benefit for these men?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3117.981,3119.031,That would be the same.
1956.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3164.937,3188.446,"Mr. Dinkelspiel, pursuing the line of questions that Mr. Justice Frankfurter was asking you, under the basic collective-bargaining agreement, did the individual contractor's members of these several associations obligate themselves to go first to the union for any labor of the categories applied by this union?"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3188.446,3195.395,"I do not know that, Your Honor, for the purposes of this motion."
1956.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3218.571,3219.68,"Well, we don't have I gather --"
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3219.68,3221.9,So we have no issue of that here.
1956.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3221.9,3226.96,Do we have in the record the basic collective-bargaining agreement in addition to the trust agreement?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3226.96,3227.911,"No, we do not."
1956.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3227.911,3230.906,Are there any allegations that relate to it?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3230.906,3240.624,The only allegations are that there was a basic collective-bargaining agreement which -- by virtue of which the trust agreement was entered into.
1956.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3240.624,3249.003,But no allegations which deal especially with the question of how Carter or other signatory members were to go about securing laborers?
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3249.003,3249.934,No.
1956.48,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3249.934,3255.43,Isn't your building industry (Inaudible)
1956.48,1,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3255.43,3257.406,I'll let Mr. Stanton answer that question.
1956.48,2,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,3257.406,3262.83,"Your Honor, these collective-bargaining agreements do not provide for union security."
1956.48,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3262.83,3268.029,I know but I'm -- in fact -- in fact aren't building industry largely unionized on the books?
1956.48,2,43352,thomas_e_stanton_jr,,3268.029,3269.163,They are largely unionized.
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3279.208,3291.296,"Now, I think some issue has been made of the fact that these payments may have constituted wages or into the -- or consideration for labor."
1956.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3321.68,3329.709,"Mr. Dinkelspiel, the thing that bothers me, if it isn't consideration for labor, what is that consideration?"
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3329.709,3332.578,The consideration --
1956.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3332.578,3335.964,For the payment of these 7 1/2 cents an hour?
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3335.964,3349.388,It is -- it may be a consideration for -- or part of the consideration of the collective-bargaining agreement.But is it related to this particular job?
1956.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3349.388,3351.785,"You mean, is it related to labor?"
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3351.785,3354.671,On this particular government contract.
1956.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3354.671,3360.772,"Then, let's say it shall be measured by the hour, 7 1/2 cents an hour --"
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3360.772,3362.3,"The contribution, yes."
1956.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3362.3,3366.187,-- for the work that is -- the work that is -- is put on the job?
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3366.187,3372.048,The contribution is based on the hours worked by the employee.
1956.48,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3475.415,3476.91,Which -- which case held that?
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3476.91,3498.06,"Those are the cases cited in our brief relating to the -- there is a whole series of Circuit Court cases covering that, United States against Crossland, pages 21 and 22 of our brief."
1956.48,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3504.381,3506.529,U.S. FMG against --
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3506.529,3511.674,U.S. FMG against United States.
1956.48,3,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3534.796,3542.027,And the -- the deduction which the employer was required to make and pay to the Government was not considered a part of the wages?
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3542.027,3550.698,"It was part of wages, and yet, the surety was held not liable to the Government for the -- if the contractor didn't pay that."
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3550.698,3571.745,"Suppose there had been individual contracts for these employees by which they were to be paid $50 a month -- a week, get $10 a week deposited in a bank to act as trustee for the welfare of the employee and his family when they were sick."
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3580.801,3584.798,"I think under the strict reasoning of these cases, it would not."
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3584.798,3584.96,Why?
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3584.96,3591.635,"However, because the condition is that the employee be paid in full."
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3624.517,3625.605,Went into a bank for him (Voice Overlap) --
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3625.605,3630.055,Went into a bank directly for his benefit in which he had an interest.
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3630.055,3644.65,"And it was conditioned on the fact that as long as he state that word “labor” for them, he would be paid $50 a month -- a week and $10 a week would be deposited in the fund for the bank to act as trustee as I stated."
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3644.65,3654.089,"If he had a direct financial interest in the $10, certainly, he would be -- or the protection of the bond would be afforded."
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3655.991,3666.774,"But if -- if the case I mentioned was, that money was to be used by the bank and administered as a trustee for the benefit of the man and his family."
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3666.774,3670.565,"There wouldn't -- there'd be no question, I don't think in that case."
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3671.001,3672.671,And you -- you think he could sue?
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3672.671,3677.894,I think he could sue if he had a vested interest in that $10.
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3677.894,3684.299,"And in the other case, you think by reason of the fact that -- I don't -- I don't quite understand the statement."
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3684.299,3684.627,But we --
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3684.627,3685.451,I haven't quite gotten --
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3685.451,3685.671,Yes.
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3685.671,3687.232,-- read and ask you that question.
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3687.232,3701.795,"The difference here is that in the case we have at the present case, he has no vested interest in the $10."
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3719.202,3720.214,For him and his family.
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3720.214,3720.989,For him and his family.
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3720.989,3724.208,With the bank to have the right to sue and he would not have the right to sue (Voice Overlap) --
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3724.208,3730.212,But that is an entirely different -- it's an entirely different state of facts than there are present here.
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3756.479,3763.606,"But he may not have an interest in the -- so that he could take them out, but he has an interest to the fund that he is --"
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3763.606,3763.948,No.
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3763.948,3764.933,"-- entitled, dosen't he?"
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3764.933,3765.276,No.
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3767.519,3768.487,Why?
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3768.487,3771.707,Because the trust agreement so provides.
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3773.223,3781.034,I don't mean -- I don't mean in law that he has some interest for which he could sue.But do you mean that he's not interested in that fund --
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3781.034,3781.173,He's interested --
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3781.173,3783.131,-- so that he might get benefits from it?
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3783.131,3794.161,"He is interested to the extent that provided, he comply with the requirements and rules set up by the trustees."
1956.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3802.512,3820.158,"What he's done realistically, I suppose, is to agree that the agreement made that in addition to his wages while he's there, that's covered and will pay a certain amount into a fund which he hopes he will get something out of in the future."
1956.48,3,39038,richard_c_dinkelspiel,,3820.158,3823.514,That's about it realistically.
