1993.93-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.869,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-377, Department of Taxation and Finance of New York v. Milhelm Attea Brothers."
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,57.569,73.6,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,135.381,152.911,"General Koppell, may I ask you if this case was litigated below at all on the notion that the New York statute is severable, that there are a variety of provisions in it, and that some of them should survive even if others do not?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,152.911,172.025,"Your Honor, the case before us narrowly focuses on the regulation of wholesalers, and not retailers, and what we are looking here is merely those aspects of the regulation that regulate the sale, or sales by wholesalers."
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.752,185.873,"And is the statute severable, in your view?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,185.873,188.174,"Yes, I think it's severable."
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.879,242.792,Does the provision requiring licensing of--
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,242.792,245.924,Of the wholesalers?
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.924,249.767,"--the wholesaler, is that before us?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,249.767,256.168,The wholesalers only have to be licensed with respect to sales to non-Indians.
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,295.816,298.959,"And the retailers would have to be licensed as well, so--"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,298.959,299.299,No--
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.299,299.77,--They would not?
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,299.77,300.809,"--That is not so, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.54,303.861,I see.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,303.861,307.935,"--not license, and specifically in the regulations, Your Honor, it states there is no fee."
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,307.935,308.685,I see.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,308.685,309.764,It's basically a re--
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,309.764,312.015,"Well, fee or not, let me ask the same question--"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,312.015,312.535,--It's not like licensing.
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,314.048,314.338,--Mr. Koppell.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,314.338,314.967,Yes.
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,314.967,318.71,"Let me ask you the same question, I think perhaps, or get to the same point that Justice O'Connor has in mind."
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,336.322,345.769,"Well, the... as I indicated earlier, the question of registration is really not before this Court, shouldn't be before this Court."
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,346.63,348.0,"Well, then your answer is no."
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,348.0,349.521,"--No, my answer is yes."
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,349.521,351.812,We can decide it strictly on the issue of quantity.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,351.812,357.506,You can decide... you can decide the... you can decide that issue.
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.649,363.56,And that's all we have to decide.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,363.56,365.621,"No, I think there is more for you to decide."
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,365.621,367.624,What is the more that we have to reach?
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,367.624,376.229,"I think you also have to reach the issue of whether the record-keeping requirements can be imposed on the wholesalers, the limited record-keeping requirements."
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,376.229,376.64,Okay.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,376.64,396.772,"As I indicated before, if I may, the court of appeals makes two basic mistakes in its reading of this Court's teachings in the Moe and Colville and Potawatomi cases, two basic flaws which are fundamental to the court of appeals decision which is before Your Honors."
1993.93-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,501.851,504.853,As you read the decision below--
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,504.853,505.624,--Yes.
1993.93-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,505.624,511.406,--If New York told wholesalers that it had to sell... that it could never sell any untaxed cigarettes--
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,511.406,512.327,Yes.
1993.93-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.327,524.035,"--and that there were then some provisions for refunds of taxes paid by Indian consumers, would that statute pass muster under this court's... this lower court's opinion?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,524.035,535.213,"I think that a system that required precollection of all taxes and then refund might well not pass muster, but this is not the system here."
1993.93-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,559.987,578.861,But why isn't the estimation of the quantity in advance... why isn't that in conflict with the Federal statute that says it's the Federal authority and not the State that is to specify the kind and quality of goods?
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,578.861,586.726,"That... I'm... thank... it is not the same, Your Honor, and I'm glad you asked the question, because that's the second flaw in the court of appeals' argument."
1993.93-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,658.232,671.211,"I was trying to determine how that refund worked, both as a matter of... would there be interest on the prepayment, if there's a refund, and how long is the process to get a refund?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,671.211,677.405,"I don't know... I don't know, to tell you the truth, Your Honor, the details of that, but the fact of the matter is that there is a process."
1993.93-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.46,694.006,"Yes, but if it's a prolonged process and there's no interest, then you are also making an interest-free loan to the State of New York, are you not?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,694.006,700.331,"Well, if it's a prolonged process, which we do not believe it would be... it has not been implemented yet."
1993.93-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.409,793.711,"But didn't we uphold some sort of procedure like that in either Moe or Colville, and wasn't that done at the retail level?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,793.711,799.643,"--Yes, it... yes, Your Honor, it was upheld that one could do that."
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,927.598,938.014,"General Koppell, are there Federal taxes imposed on the cigarettes?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,938.014,939.046,"I believe there are, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,939.046,941.137,Is that handled by any kind of a stamp mechanism?
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,941.137,945.22,"Again, I believe so, but I haven't really studied that."
1993.93-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.494,955.288,"I assume this could be a problem for any New York sales taxes, couldn't it?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,958.947,960.189,--Yes.
1993.93-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.82,961.85,--That's why the problem only arises with cigarettes.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,961.85,962.33,"Yes, that is correct."
1993.93-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,962.33,964.083,But it could happen for sales of other goods as well.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,964.083,993.182,"Yes, and there have been very serious problems when New York has attempted to collect sales taxes on reservation sales, and we're trying to get at it without creating, if you will a... it wouldn't be a civil war, because these are sovereign nations, but without creating a war with the Indian nations, or with individuals on the Indian reservations, and that's why this allocation system, that allocates a certain number of tax-free cigarettes, is the most efficient way and easiest way and least intrusive way of solving the problem and still retaining to the State the ability to tax."
1993.93-377,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1026.034,1029.717,"I can't resist this question, when you speak of the huge amount of evasion."
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1049.578,1068.562,"12,000... I think that the estimate that we were given by the Tax Department was that if the consumption in 1988 was really only by Indians, they would be smoking 15 packs a day, every man, woman, and child, so that the evasion is obviously substantial."
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.903,1100.672,"General Koppell, does the same problem exist with regard to other products that are sold on the reservation, for instance, in discount stores on major appliances and so forth?"
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1100.672,1105.558,"The same problem can exist with respect to that, but the taxes are much, much lower, obviously."
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1107.778,1109.349,But it's the same situation.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1109.349,1110.681,"Yes, it would be the same situation, and you--"
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1110.681,1116.224,"But there, New York has no scheme for advance payment of taxes, presumably."
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1120.205,1122.479,"--No, there's no... no, there's no system, that's correct."
1993.93-377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1123.837,1129.171,So there you would have to impose any record-keeping on the retailer.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1129.171,1129.832,--That is correct.
1993.93-377,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.756,1152.796,You could probably solve the problem by lowering the taxes.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1154.849,1166.386,"You... well, as you know, Your Honor, the trend, whether fortunately or unfortunately, of taxation on both cigarettes and gasoline is in the other direction."
1993.93-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.386,1187.511,"I don't have a precise hypothetical for you, but if the State were attempting to impose this sort of regulation on some other State, like Baldwin v. Seilig, we would have a metaphysical problem because you would be regulating an interstate transaction, and that's beyond your authority."
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1196.707,1208.304,"Well, I don't recall, but I do know that there are severe limitations on our ability to actually impact on the sovereign State itself."
1993.93-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1219.871,1236.952,"That is why I had suggested that if the wholesalers just couldn't sell any nontaxed cigarettes at all, that ultimately may be more intrusive, but it seems to me that it confines you to your proper jurisdiction without your running up against the Federal statute, which is its exclusive area."
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1236.952,1244.259,I don't believe that the Federal statute prevents you from doing what we're doing here.
1993.93-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1276.818,1277.649,But my submission is--
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1277.649,1278.2,--and therefore--
1993.93-377,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1278.2,1286.464,"--My submission is it may be less burdensome, but the hypothetical I put still confines you to your appropriate area of regulation."
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1286.464,1290.227,--I don't quite follow Your Honor.
1993.93-377,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1446.88,1453.712,You don't think the wholesaler can raise the interest of a third party in not having this rationing system.
1993.93-377,0,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,1453.712,1499.593,"--I don't think that they can, and frankly I don't think that they did in this case, even if they could, so the fact... but again, even if we look at that system, and I call to your attention, incidentally, with respect to that a particular affidavit which is in the record on appeal, pages 244 to 246, which describes the system as respects the retailers, and I don't believe that that is impermissible or violates preemption, because I think it's a logical system that allocates the tax-free cigarettes among the retailers, and as I indicated earlier, they don't have to be licensed, they merely have to register, and so again, Your Honors, I urge you to reverse the determination of the court of appeals and sustain the system, and I would request that I reserve the remaining time for rebuttal."
1993.93-377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1499.593,1502.475,"Very well, General Koppell."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1503.977,1514.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.074,1610.107,"Well, the Indian vendor that you refer to, the retailers, they are Indian traders too, aren't they?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1610.107,1613.198,They are in the sense that they--
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.198,1614.52,As far as the act is concerned.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1614.52,1615.221,--Correct.
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1615.221,1615.431,They qualify under the act.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1615.431,1617.583,"Insofar as they sell to Indians, they are Indian traders."
1993.93-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.583,1628.361,"So why couldn't you regulate them with the same degree of... considering the Indian Trading Act, if both are subject to the Indian Trading Act?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1633.864,1634.265,"No, sir."
1993.93-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.29,1666.576,The Federal law didn't provide for addition of State taxes at the time the Indian retailers sold to nontribal members.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1668.156,1677.411,"That's true, Your Honor, and the reason that you did was because sales to non-Indians are not within the scope of the Indian trader laws."
1993.93-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.411,1681.685,"Well, that's not why we said... we didn't even mention the Indian trader law in Moe I don't think, did we?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1681.685,1715.277,"I think... well, Your Honor, I would trust your recollection, but my belief is that in Moe or Colville the Court specifically noted that the Indian trader laws and regulations did not preempt the enforcement of the tax at the retail level because it was a sale to a non-Indian, and that there was an important distinction between Congress' intention to comprehensively regulate sales to Indians and sales to non-Indians where there is no such intent."
1993.93-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1772.376,1785.263,I thought that General Koppell said that no license would be required for a wholesaler who sold only to Indians.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1786.405,1787.667,--He said... he said--
1993.93-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1787.667,1787.865,Do you disagree with that?
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1787.865,1796.892,"--Your Honor, I believe what he meant was that no license would be required if he sold only to Indians who in turn sold only to Indians."
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.813,1832.765,None of the retailers on the reservations are non-Indians?
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1833.936,1835.597,"All of the retailers are Indians, sir."
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.597,1838.108,"Is that a requirement, or just--"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1838.108,1841.579,"There's not a requirement, although I think in most--"
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.579,1842.27,"--In practice, it's--"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1842.27,1857.251,"--In most cases on reservations in New York the tribal governments would not approval a non-Indian conducting a retail operation on a reservation, so in this case all of the retail vendors, all of our purchasers, are Indians, and the problem with--"
1993.93-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1857.251,1876.553,"--Well now... now, has this Court indicated that a State can even require an Indian retailer to assume minimum burdens of record-keeping and the collection and payment to the State of taxes on sales by the Indian retailer to non-Indians?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1876.553,1878.205,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1878.205,1881.518,And the State says that's all their doing here.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1881.518,1883.318,But that's not all the State is doing here.
1993.93-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1900.319,1906.342,But they say they are only taxing based on projected sales to non-Indians.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1908.174,1916.69,"That's true, and that's what their claim is, but frankly, we have no way of determining whether that is a reasonable scheme."
1993.93-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.962,1922.032,"Well, if that's true... if that's true, is there a problem under our cases?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1922.032,1923.244,"--I think so, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.794,1925.215,Why?
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1925.215,1931.86,Because this Court has recognized that regulating trade with Indians is a Federal matter.
1993.93-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1960.869,1997.234,"Mr. Zdarsky, in Moe we took up the Warren Trading Post argument and there was argued there that it was contrary to Warren Trading Post to allow the exaction of the sales tax on Indian retailer sales to non-Indians, and we said, unlike the sales tax in Moe, the tax in Warren was imposed directly on the seller, and here to extend that principle to the... the way you're talking about, we refused to do it in Moe."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,1999.755,2003.437,"Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree with that reading of the case."
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.803,2074.601,"Oh, but I would think under you theory you would have been entitled to one."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2083.02,2085.5,--I do contend there is conflict.
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.5,2085.9,Oh.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2088.502,2091.484,"Well, that's our principal argument, that the field has been preempted."
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.484,2095.746,But there is also specific implementing Federal regulations that are in conflict with the--
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2095.746,2096.597,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.155,2114.068,"--Well, this doesn't determine price, quantity, or kind, does it?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2114.068,2115.2,"It certainly does, sir."
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2125.926,2127.819,"You're saying the tax is part of the price, that's--"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2127.819,2136.004,"It is part of the price, and that is specifically expressly provided in the New York statute, and as this Court has held in the past, a tax law--"
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.004,2141.947,"--What if they amended the New York statute to say, although we used to call it part of the price, we just now all it a surcharge, or something like that."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2145.109,2164.122,"--Yes, I think there would, because in this Court's decision in the Mississippi Tax Commission cases, which dealt with an analogous circumstance... sales to a Federal instrumentality... there was a wholesale markup that was charged on sales by out-of-State distributors to military bases within the State of Mississippi."
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2183.345,2188.247,--I don't see that that case supports your position that there's a conflict between this regulation and--
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2188.247,2188.758,--Well--
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.758,2210.571,"--I understand your argument about preemption, but the question I really was leading up to is, why isn't your... why wasn't your preemption position totally controlling of the sale by an Indian retailer to either a non-Indian or an Indian, because it's still governed by the statute, the Federal statute, isn't it?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2210.571,2214.874,--We are not involved in that subsequent transaction.
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.874,2220.578,"No, I understand, but your argument, it seems to me, would have required a different result in the portion of the opinion that the Chief Justice read to you."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2223.48,2237.912,"Mr. Justice Stevens, our position is that the sales to the retail customer do not determine the preemptive effect of the Indian trader laws on the wholesale transaction."
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.381,2248.807,"Yes, but wouldn't your 100 percent preemption argument require that there be no regulation of the retail sales by the State, no impact on that at all?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2248.807,2269.011,"--No, because as I understand it, insofar as retailers are selling to non-Indians, by electing to sell to both Indians and non-Indians, this Court has found that those sales that to non-Indians, since they are not covered by the Indian trader laws, that permits the State to impose a minimal burden on that retail seller."
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.011,2271.382,Whereas you sell only to Indians.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2271.382,2272.093,That's... that's--
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.093,2273.125,That's the principal distinction.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2273.125,2273.676,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2273.676,2292.876,"But in assessing the burdens that are placed on the wholesalers in connection with that sale, it seems to me that we should look only at the burden on the wholesaler, not any subsequent downstream burden imposed on the subsequent Indian retail sale."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2292.876,2293.617,I agree.
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.617,2297.951,Let me ask another hypothetical about your position.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2319.786,2324.188,"I think that that's true, Your Honor, because Congress has not authorized the States--"
1993.93-377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.188,2324.619,Right.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2324.619,2325.34,--to enforce those laws.
1993.93-377,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2340.41,2350.698,"Are you saying that it's only Congress that can provide the cure, that the Commissioner could not say, well, this is a pretty good scheme that New York has, so I'm going to adopt a regulation that says all States can do this?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2350.698,2362.275,"I think that the Commissioner could adopt a regulation, Justice Ginsburg, that provides for a scheme that would affect trade with Indians."
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.376,2388.933,"Mr. Zdarsky, do you think that if you were selling to a retailer who was not an Indian... hypothetically."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2393.805,2395.617,Who's not an Indian?
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.617,2396.028,Yes.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2396.028,2396.769,You would not be.
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.769,2402.653,"You sell onto the reservation, to a retailer on the reservation, but that retailer is not an Indian."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2402.653,2408.565,"You would not be an Indian trader as to that transaction, because that transaction is not covered by the Indian trader statutes or regulations."
1993.93-377,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.099,2418.542,"Even though the resale... even though the sale is onto the reservation and it's known that the resale will be made to Indians, among others."
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2418.542,2432.21,"--That's correct, Your Honor, because the Indian trader laws and regulations don't provide that the coverage at the wholesale level is determined by something that happens at a subsequent event at the retail level."
1993.93-377,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2458.389,2460.91,Suppose it were not a contingent obligation.
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2470.627,2472.848,"I think that would be worse, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-377,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2472.848,2477.26,"Would it be... as a practical matter, would it be a greater burden on you?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2477.26,2491.031,"Yes, because every dollar that our customer must commit to paying tax to us as opposed to purchasing product limits the ability of the wholesaler to sell goods to that customer."
1993.93-377,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2507.39,2513.654,"How do you answer the problem of the 15 packs a day for every woman, man, and child on the reservation?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2517.896,2521.559,"But that isn't our... that isn't our doing, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-377,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2521.559,2527.984,Are you saying that the State is helpless until either the Commissioner or Congress comes to the rescue?
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2527.984,2529.537,"No, I do not, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2563.166,2583.52,"No, but you're also implicitly saying, leaving aside legislation and agreements, you are implicitly saying, or explicitly saying, that some action could be taken directly against the Indians with respect to the non-Indian sales, and since you are in a derivative position, why aren't you just as open to such action as the retailers would be?"
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2583.52,2589.243,"Because, Your Honor, we do not agree that we are in a derivative position."
1993.93-377,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2623.767,2634.145,Why aren't you in a derivative position simply because ultimately your complaint rests upon the fact that there is a limitation or a tax upon an Indian sale which in fact is prohibited?
1993.93-377,1,33741,joseph_e_zdarsky,,2634.145,2651.637,"--Because our position, Your Honor, is based on the fact that we are selling to an Indian, that Indian transaction, that sale transaction cannot be regulated by the State, and that therefore we are not responsible for the taxes from that point on."
1993.93-377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2651.637,2653.167,"Thank you, Mr. Zdarsky."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2654.579,2665.315,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-377,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2708.334,2713.958,"Well, you then take on the Attorney General in his view of the narrowness of this case."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2713.958,2715.327,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2715.327,2717.49,You say we cannot decide it as narrowly as he said.
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2718.25,2718.66,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.66,2730.077,"--Would you just... did I hear you right, you can require the wholesaler with respect to sales to Indians, did you say, or did you mean non-Indians?"
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2730.077,2745.228,We believe under the reasoning of Moe and Colville the State can impose on the wholesaler simple collection and remittance requirements and record-keeping requirement on their sales that are going through Indian retailers to non-Indian.
1993.93-377,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2745.228,2749.222,"Collection, remittance, and what else?"
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2749.222,2752.243,"Of the tax and record-keeping, which this Court upheld in Colville."
1993.93-377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2752.243,2768.753,"Ms. Brinkmann, a fair amount of your brief here was devoted to the effect of the New York regulations on Indian retailers, and yet as I read the New York Court of Appeals opinion, there weren't any Indian retailers involved."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2774.316,2780.283,"Your Honor, I think that's similar to the question that was just asked of me also about the question of what's before the Court."
1993.93-377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2803.327,2807.268,But in fact there were no retailers who were parties to this case.
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2807.268,2808.059,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2808.059,2823.83,"So one has to decide it only in terms of the wholesalers' claims, and perhaps wholesalers can claim that they are protected by the Indian trader statutes in their dealing with retailers, but you agree there are no retailers parties here."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2823.83,2831.054,"There are no retailers parties, Your Honor, but I think the New York Court of Appeals recognized the inherent connection between the two ends of commerce and trade."
1993.93-377,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2831.054,2837.428,"Well, in effect you're saying that the wholesalers have standing to raise the burdens that are imposed on the retailer."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2837.428,2843.973,"Your Honor, for example, the burden that retailers register with the State, that necessarily is a burden on the wholesalers."
1993.93-377,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2852.188,2856.552,What do you say to the respondents' position that there's nothing derivative about his rights?
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2856.552,2858.844,"We disagree, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2889.764,2897.919,"Well, do you think the tax can be collected in advance of the sale by the State, if it's a sale to a non-Indian?"
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2897.919,2898.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2912.2,2921.534,But the mere fact that it's collected in advance and is in turn transmitted by an Indian retailer does not invalidate the State scheme?
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2921.534,2936.764,"--We believe that the Court's analysis in its early opinions in which it permitted the retailers to be required to collect the tax, from that it flows that that can be passed on to the wholesaler."
1993.93-377,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2941.188,2958.64,"The argument being made by Mr. Zdarsky is that the difference is it can only be collected at the time of sale, and no advance payment of the tax can be levied, but I don't understand you to be supporting that argument."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2958.64,2959.281,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2968.407,2978.342,Then do you take issue with New York's effort to estimate the amount of tax that will be required--
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2978.342,2979.574,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2979.574,2981.533,--based on estimated sales to non-Indians?
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2981.533,2981.934,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3002.899,3022.961,"I could see how you can say that if you also took the position that you can't make them prepay taxes, but it seems to me rather strange to say that it's not an impermissible burden to make them prepay taxes that are really owed by somebody else, but that they cannot be forced to comply with relatively minimal record-keeping requirements."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3022.961,3034.388,"--Your Honor, I think it's the difference between a mere collection of a tax that as the Court in its earlier cases found was necessary because of a validly imposed tax and a regulatory scheme that in truth--"
1993.93-377,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3034.388,3037.26,But how are you going to determine what the prepayment should be?
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3042.806,3050.613,"--Your Honor, we believe there are several avenues which the State can pursue, and I think one of the issues that we differ is the premise of the wholesale evasion."
1993.93-377,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3050.613,3051.952,"Well, what--"
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3051.952,3052.393,The--
1993.93-377,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3052.393,3057.338,--First explain to me what... you say prepayment by the wholesaler is all right.
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3058.097,3058.718,--As well as the retailer.
1993.93-377,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3058.718,3061.63,--wholesaler tie that prepayment to?
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3065.212,3072.586,"For example, in Colville, the Court upheld the record-keeping requirement on the retailers for both sales to Indians and non-Indians."
1993.93-377,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3101.507,3112.112,"Can you be a little clearer on exactly what New York could legitimately do in the way of saying, wholesaler, you prepay."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3115.795,3130.856,"--Once the Court makes clear that these taxes are applicable in the State of New York to the retailers and wholesalers, there's no reason to expect that there would be this type of wholesale evasion that's alleged here."
1993.93-377,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3145.916,3163.316,"Yes, but if it doesn't want to, it seems to me it can stonewall the whole thing by saying yes, you can precollect, but we're simply not going to give you the figures upon which you can base a precollection, and because the other aspects of the scheme have been held to be unduly onerous, that's the end of the precollection scheme."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3163.316,3167.318,"--Your Honor, under Colville we believe that they would be required to provide that record-keeping."
1993.93-377,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3192.725,3193.216,Well--
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3193.216,3196.336,--through the Department of the Interior if there are regulations--
1993.93-377,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3196.336,3202.86,"--that's fine, except that I think, if I understand what you're saying, you're saying the State would simply go to a different collection scheme."
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3208.394,3213.57,"--No, Your Honor, we believe that that record-keeping obligation can be also imposed on the wholesaler."
1993.93-377,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3215.019,3216.522,As an incident of this taxation scheme.
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3216.522,3217.941,Yes.
1993.93-377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.263,3222.136,I think your time has expired--
1993.93-377,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3222.136,3223.095,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.93-377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3223.095,3223.445,--Ms. Brinkmann.
1993.93-377,3,25567,g_oliver_koppell,,3225.818,3245.41,"To be very brief, Mr. Chief Justice, the Central Machinery and Warren Trading Post cases relied on by respondents specifically related to taxes on sellers, in the case of Central Machinery of farm machinery, to Indian tribes and Indians on the reservation."
