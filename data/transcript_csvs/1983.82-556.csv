1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.167,"We will hear arguments next in Press-Enterprise Company against Superior Court of California, Riverside County."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,41.717,53.698,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a closure case involving specifically the issue of closure of the voir dire proceedings in a capital case."
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,61.633,65.536,I want to be sure not to misunderstand you.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,73.221,74.751,The case below was limited--
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,74.751,75.063,Yes.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,75.063,76.282,"--to a capital case, and the--"
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,76.282,77.125,But--
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,77.125,87.403,--the trial court was... and the courts below have been utilizing the authority of a case which dealt with the interrogation of the jury in a capital case.
1983.82-556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,122.982,127.23,"--Well, we can't actually do that for you, can we, Mr. Ward?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,135.103,156.516,"Justice Rehnquist, the Supreme Court of the state of California pronounced a rule in this case as to the method of selecting jurors in capital cases which has been, in our opinion, misinterpreted by the trial courts of our state in a way that has impacted upon our constitutional rights."
1983.82-556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.511,171.243,"We could certainly say that if it were so construed, it would have an impact on your rights, I suppose."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,171.243,176.102,"I believe we are saying the same thing, Justice Rehnquist, in a different... at least I am attempting to do so."
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,233.702,235.546,But doing it only in capital cases?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,235.546,240.888,"To our knowledge, the problem only arose in capital cases."
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.709,339.488,Is that fairly typical in capital cases in California?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,339.488,348.53,"Unfortunately, Mr. Chief Justice, the length of time for selecting of juries has grown by leaps and bounds in California."
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,348.53,351.279,I take it California lets the lawyers do it.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,351.279,352.904,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.188,432.872,"Neither of those rights are in the Constitution, are they, either of them, the juror's right to privacy or the public's right to now?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,432.872,436.168,"I agree with that, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,445.774,448.429,Did you agree there is no right to know in the Constitution?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,448.429,451.005,"--I am sorry, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.426,455.16,I think you might as well sit down if you agree with that.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,464.953,472.98,"I cannot, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, at this point in time, cite the passage from the Constitution."
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,599.6,613.112,"You would think, I gather, that your First Amendment right would be satisfied even if you were excluded from the voir dire proceeding itself if a transcript of that proceeding were made available to you?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,613.112,617.844,"--No, Justice Brennan, we would not be satisfied with exclusion from the proceedings itself."
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,801.41,807.579,"May I ask you, Mr. Ward, are you going to argue that there are no circumstances under which there may be closure of the voir dire?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,807.579,812.53,--I would not espouse an absolute rule.
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,819.294,825.088,"Well, how do you suggest there be an inquiry into those circumstances, whether or not there are such circumstances?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,825.088,831.507,--I believe that a hearing would has to be held giving a reasonable right to the public and press to--
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.507,832.195,Initiated how?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,832.195,837.598,"--That's a problem of great difficulty that this Court has, I think, faced before."
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,843.564,844.329,"I mean, notice to whom?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,845.501,848.015,Notice to the public and press.
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,848.015,854.232,"In general, what criteria do you have in mind?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,854.232,855.685,As to the notice?
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,855.685,858.841,"No, not the notice, the substance of the inquiry."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,858.841,878.706,"The substance of the inquiry, it would strike me as, it would be strictly as to the necessity and the application of the rules laid down by this Court as to closure, and the inquiry would go simply to the requirement of the court under the given circumstances to look to any closure."
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,878.706,880.409,Who would have the burden of proof?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,880.409,883.814,The burden would be on those seeking closure.
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,883.814,886.454,And by what standard of proof?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,886.454,888.265,I think that the--
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,888.265,888.922,Clear and convincing?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,888.922,896.918,"--I would believe that clear and convincing would be the appropriate standard, because we are dealing with the First Amendment right of access."
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,904.524,911.366,"I gather you would argue, Mr. Ward, that the presumption should be that the voir dire should be open."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,911.366,916.379,"--Yes, most assuredly, Justice Brennan, and for a very elemental reason."
1983.82-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,960.221,965.109,You do have a problem that some states don't take six months to pick a jury.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,965.109,967.78,"--Well, that's quite true, Justice Marshall."
1983.82-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,967.78,970.247,How would you accommodate that?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,970.247,980.072,"I don't think, however, that the presence of the public is the reason for the six months or for any lengthy interrogation."
1983.82-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,980.072,980.383,I see.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,980.383,986.084,"Perhaps it lies, although I hesitate to say so, with the fact that lawyers do the interrogation."
1983.82-556,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,998.799,1003.968,"It would make no difference to you whether it was ten minutes, a half an hour, or six months?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1003.968,1006.749,"It would make no difference whatsoever, Justice Marshall."
1983.82-556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.45,1010.262,"Mr. Ward, can I ask this question?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1013.762,1015.276,--I agree.
1983.82-556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.276,1038.531,"--and I don't pretend to have even begun to have read it, but if the substance of what the California Supreme Court suggests, and as I say, I don't really know whether this is true or not, is that the public... the conduct of the voir dire in public and press attention to the voir dire would somehow tend to make the jury more prone to impose the death penalty than otherwise, if that is in essence what they are saying, would that be a valid reason for closure?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1038.531,1044.983,"Well, I can't go with the supposition in the first place, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.981,1089.309,Let me take it a step further.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1123.903,1146.129,"--One would have... if one could follow all of those suppositions, I would assume that if we were convinced that the process created a predisposition towards the death penalty, one would have to consider it a compelling reason to consent to closure, but I can't agree, of course, with any of the--"
1983.82-556,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.129,1149.409,"As a matter of fact, you don't think such a showing has yet been made?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1149.409,1151.674,"--Oh, absolutely not, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1183.504,1205.386,"Mr. Ward, do you think that prospective jurors do have any rights concerning questions that may be of a very personal or private nature to have the process closed that have to be considered by the trial court?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1205.386,1242.747,"--Assuming for the moment, Justice O'Connor, that there is some right of the juror to refrain from responding to a question for whatever reason similar to the ones that you may have posited there, the fact remains that I can conceive of no circumstance why it would be necessary to close the courtroom in order to solve that problem for the juror, because there are reasonable alternatives available to the court to avoid any damage to any perceived right of the juror in those circumstances."
1983.82-556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1242.747,1244.84,Such as what alternatives?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1244.84,1262.629,"The most obvious being, of course, that the court could excuse the juror before invading any perceived right of privacy, because the defendant has the right to a fair and impartial juror and a fair and impartial jury, but not to a specific juror."
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1325.743,1338.238,"Mr. Ward, in some systems, as you no doubt know, a jury in a criminal case is put in the box and sworn within an hour, sometimes 30 minutes, sometimes 15 minutes."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1364.963,1415.629,"It would be my position, yes, that the questionnaires, being part of the process, should be available to the press, but if I may elaborate on that, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the use of questionnaires is one of those less restrictive alternatives that could help us avoid the problem with the juror and yet permit the public access to the proceedings, because I submit that if we are dealing with a case, one of the more common sensitive areas with which we are concerned is, for instance, sexual preferences, and if the questionnaires were directed in such a way to elicit from jurors whether any of them harbored any feelings or had any problems in these areas, it could be resolved short of offending any juror's rights in that regard, and we believe that questionnaires is indeed one of the very viable, less restrictive alternatives that would be available to the court."
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1415.629,1423.798,"But if it is available, if, as you say, that questionnaire should be available to the media, then where is the protection of the privacy?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1423.798,1445.617,"The protection arrives, Your Honor, in connection with the use of careful questioning, and the judge at the trial level controlling the court can see to it that the questioning does not offend areas of potential privacy or sensitivity if they exist."
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1445.617,1463.094,"I take it, Mr. Ward, whether the system is of individual interrogation or of the venire as a group, all you are asking is that the press be allowed to be present."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1463.094,1464.859,"Absolutely, Justice Brennan."
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1472.169,1487.148,"Well, I can remember interrogating prospective jurors in chambers with just counsel present, and your suggestion would be there also ought to be present at least the press."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1493.535,1499.205,We would find inappropriate the interrogation of jurors in chambers.
1983.82-556,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1499.205,1500.922,Inappropriate?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1500.922,1502.188,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1983.82-556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1509.39,1521.229,"Mr. Ward, would your supposed rights extend beyond voir dire and into, for example, the plea bargaining process between the prosecutor and defense counsel?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1521.229,1525.007,"--We make that... We do not make that suggestion at this time, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1525.007,1527.288,You are saving that for tomorrow?
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1527.288,1528.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.625,1588.732,"Of course, to say that Globe controls, you have to show that this is really part of the trial, don't you?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1588.732,1593.043,"We would contend fervently that it is a part of the trial, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1593.043,1598.025,"Well, how do you define trial for that purpose?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1598.025,1608.286,"Well, the trial in the appellate courts of the state of California has been defined... has been defined as commencing with the selection of the jury."
1983.82-556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1644.679,1664.107,"Well, suppose in this case instead of it being voir dire, it had been a motion the day before it was set for trial for a continuance, at which both sides were going to present witnesses, and then the trial judge felt there was a fair amount of reason for closing that because the witnesses might touch on some sensitive matters."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1674.135,1675.993,Not necessarily.
1983.82-556,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.472,1697.297,"Well, would you say that a motion for a continuance the day before the jury was scheduled to be empaneled would also be what you call a ""part of the process""?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1697.297,1710.433,We are not prepared at this time to indicate that all of the proceedings which go on prior to the... prior to the commencement of the jury selection are a part of the trial.
1983.82-556,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.433,1716.134,"When you say, we are not prepared to do it at this time, it is sort of an unsatisfactory answer."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1721.819,1723.459,"All right, Justice O'Connor, I am sorry."
1983.82-556,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1735.25,1737.391,"We got into that in Gannett, didn't we?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1737.391,1738.733,"--Pardon me, Justice Blackmun?"
1983.82-556,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1738.733,1742.607,"I say, in the Gannett case, we certainly got into pretrial material."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1742.607,1756.976,"Certainly, Justice Blackmun, you did get into it in the Gannett case, which... it was approached from the Sixth Amendment analysis, and we are not, of course, in this case claiming any Sixth Amendment right of access."
1983.82-556,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.081,1771.751,I suppose the whole case could go off just on whether this is part of the trial or not.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1775.015,1780.435,"No, I think not, Justice White, because I think that the--"
1983.82-556,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.435,1781.95,"--Well, you do submit it is part of the trial."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1781.95,1784.746,--I do submit that it is part?
1983.82-556,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.619,1790.587,"If we agree with you, wouldn't Richmond control?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1790.587,1791.556,--Absolutely.
1983.82-556,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.426,1813.25,"Well, if it isn't part of the trial, then we have to consider the relationship of Gannett and Richmond."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1813.25,1816.499,"--Yes, that's true, so let's keep as part of the trial."
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1817.795,1826.9,"In California, does the trial be with the jury selection for all purposes, for example double jeopardy?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1829.244,1830.181,Double--
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.181,1832.882,"When does jeopardy attach, not double jeopardy?"
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1832.882,1840.193,"--Jeopardy attaches with the commencement of the taking of testimony, but the test there, Mr. Chief Justice, is significantly different."
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1847.08,1851.391,"Yes, I know, but your previous statement was that a trial commences with the select of the jury."
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1854.859,1855.171,--Yes.
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.171,1856.763,That is your contention.
1983.82-556,0,33420,james_d_ward,,1856.763,1857.513,That is correct.
1983.82-556,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.387,1859.919,Very well.
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,1861.479,1899.122,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents a situation which calls for the delicate balancing of three fundamental interests, the Sixth Amendment right of a defendant to a fair trial, the First Amendment right of the press to gather and report the news, and the First Amendment and penumbral rights of the prospective jurors to a right to privacy."
1983.82-556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1917.489,1924.471,"Are you talking, Mr. Salter, about a juror's right to privacy guaranteed by the federal Constitution?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,1924.471,1926.314,Yes.
1983.82-556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.314,1931.281,What provision of the United States Constitution do you think guarantees a juror's right to privacy?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,1931.281,1938.886,The right to privacy is not specifically enumerated in either the Constitution or in the Bill of Rights.
1983.82-556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.739,1960.488,And what cases from this Court do you rely on for that proposition?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,1960.488,1965.064,"I think we cited several in the brief, for instance Griswald, the Griswald case."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1965.064,1979.011,Could a juror refuse to answer a judge's question on the voir dire on the grounds that it would violate his right of privacy?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,1979.011,1983.884,"I believe our position would be, yes, he would have that right."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1983.884,1986.133,And do you think a judge would... do what?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,1986.133,1991.599,We had a case in California that just went up on appeal.
1983.82-556,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.614,1996.317,"Would you raise your voice a little bit, counsel?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,1996.317,1997.207,I am sorry.
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.62,2019.729,"What was it, Fifth Amendment?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2019.729,2023.4,"No, she was--"
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.4,2028.194,"I think we are too... I am responsible for it, but I think we are too far afield, aren't we?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2028.194,2048.546,"--Well, I think the question is appropriate, though, because her response really was, you are asking the male jurors questions as... you do not ask them what their spouse does, but you ask the female jurors what their husband's occupation is, and she says, that violates my rights, and I am going to refuse to answer, and the Court of Appeals held that she had that right."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2048.546,2052.888,"You mean, you have the right of privacy not to tell your husband's work?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2052.888,2056.666,It was not a right to privacy issue.
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.557,2058.369,I didn't think so.
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2058.369,2059.181,--the fact that she could refuse.
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2059.181,2061.384,I am asking for the right of privacy point.
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2067.178,2077.799,"I believe... I am unaware of any case which has supported that, but I believe that a juror would have that right."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.799,2081.344,I would hate to see somebody try.
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2096.213,2098.931,"Well, we start with the--"
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2098.931,2105.678,"--Suppose in the middle of a trial, we have a case here in this Court where a juror was drunk."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2113.097,2120.001,"--If the juror was drunk, he would probably be released on the grounds of being an incompetent juror."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2120.001,2122.125,"I mean, could he say, you can't question me?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2125.561,2126.061,He would have to have some basis for it.
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2126.061,2126.624,What?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2126.624,2130.559,He would have to have some basis for refusing to respond to the--
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.559,2131.7,Other than privacy?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2131.7,2132.918,--No.
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2132.918,2135.996,"He could say privacy, then."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2135.996,2137.915,"Yes, I believe he could."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2148.208,2149.505,"Well, that's all you're telling me."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2149.505,2152.253,"--No, I don't believe so."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.987,2156.362,"Justice Rehnquist asked you, where was it in the Constitution."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2156.362,2157.126,--Let me give you--
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2157.126,2159.142,"I am asking you, where is it any place?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2159.142,2160.75,--Let me give you an example.
1983.82-556,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.471,2195.219,So how do they decide that?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2201.827,2209.45,Part of the reason that voir dire has taken so long is because of the very recent case of People versus Williams.
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.568,2269.862,May I ask if the voir dire in this particular case is in the record before us?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2270.518,2273.188,The voir dire was not made available.
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.188,2274.875,Have you examined it?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2274.875,2275.797,"No, I have not."
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2277.53,2280.92,So you didn't participate in the trial then?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2280.92,2281.638,"No, I did not."
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.638,2295.15,"Because I was just wondering if there is any way to find out what percentage of this massive inquiry really involved confidential matters, or privacy matters, however you want to describe them."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2295.15,2301.91,"What occurred was that they held three days of general voir dire, asking the typical voir dire questions."
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.91,2302.285,I understand.
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2303.691,2322.341,"But then, after that, issues which dealt with matters of privacy, sexual relations, race, religion, politics, those questions were then reserved for that part of the voir dire which was held privately."
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.341,2333.29,Are you suggesting that the entire off the record voir dire or whatever it is involved these matters that would not normally be conducted in open court?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2346.831,2349.438,"Not having read it, I could not tell you."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.81,2367.557,Do you know of any case before this Court that we were denied the right to see what we were passing upon?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2367.557,2370.025,"No, I am unaware, Your Honor--"
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.025,2372.196,Including the Pentagon Papers?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2374.975,2378.599,"--Certainly, I am sure we can make that available."
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.393,2386.362,I don't wish to see it.
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2391.203,2393.53,"No, it was... when the appendix was put together--"
1983.82-556,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2393.53,2394.139,"So the answer is, we can see it."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2394.139,2397.873,--it was the joint decision by counsel to include what was included.
1983.82-556,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.086,2416.553,Was it printed for the appeal to the California Court of Appeals?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2416.553,2446.93,"A transcript was made of it, and it was under seal, and it was distributed to counsel who would deal with the matter on appeal, but any references to that transcript are, according to the trial court's order, to be done in a confidential manner, so if there is any question as far as the propriety of questions asked at the voir dire or in the selection of the jury, the defendant and the prosecutor would have the option and the ability to deal with that question."
1983.82-556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2446.93,2455.178,"Mr. Salter, were there any feasible alternatives to a permanent sealing of that record?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2474.748,2495.723,"I think first it is important that the newspaper did not point out at the time of trial, either before the voir dire occurred or after it occurred, any possible alternatives, and the trial court did, I believe, choose an alternative, and I think probably the most appropriate alternative."
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.28,2511.718,"Mr. Salter, I am sorry."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2537.066,2539.52,"--It is related to the problem of peremptory challenges, yes."
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.755,2579.643,"What would otherwise have been just not... You have to make a record, in other words, to justify peremptory challenges if they concentrate on one minority group or something like that?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2579.643,2580.643,Basically that's true.
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.018,2621.752,"In a capital case, how many peremptory challenges does each party have?"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2621.752,2625.811,"I believe it is 26, although they are allowed to augment."
1983.82-556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2652.441,2661.359,"Well, I suppose at least you could consider whether you could delete the identification of those responding."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2661.359,2688.614,"--I think the problem in a small community would be that if the public is allowed to come into the courtroom, even if a juror had, instead of a tag that said Juror on it, it said Number 18, someone in the audience may very well know who that person is, and so that person may very well say Juror Number 18, who happens to be someone next door to me, answered the question this way."
1983.82-556,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2690.753,2695.127,"Well, but if we are dealing with a transcript, that wouldn't be the case."
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2695.127,2715.416,"I think some of the same problems arise, because it is the answers which you can begin to relate to certain individuals, and I think it's the issue that people would be able to tell from either the types of questions or the responses given who those individuals might be."
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.088,2871.603,Should we not presume that the citizens will tell the truth before the--
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2871.603,2874.773,--I think we need to presume that they will tell the truth.
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.5,2894.047,"--Well, I understand that--"
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2894.047,2894.999,To be willing to--
1983.82-556,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.999,2897.513,--but that is an argument you are making in favor of closing the voir dire to the public?
1983.82-556,1,26021,glenn_robert_salter,,2897.513,2909.837,--I am not suggesting per se that the jurors would lie simply to get off a juror.
1983.82-556,2,33420,james_d_ward,,3555.093,3556.656,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-556,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3600.684,3628.234,"Somewhere in these papers or in the whole treatment in the discussion of less burdensome alternatives was the idea that if a juror had some confidential matter they wanted not to be interrogated about, they go to the judge in chambers or communicate with him and explain this and then ask to be excused."
1983.82-556,2,33420,james_d_ward,,3637.356,3650.226,"I think, Your Honor, that the use of that sort of a process is one of the less restrictive alternatives which is available, because assuming for the moment that there is defined--"
1983.82-556,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3650.226,3657.629,"But you would waive any inquiry, any claim to a right to know what the reasons were?"
1983.82-556,2,33420,james_d_ward,,3657.629,3660.472,"--Yes, most assuredly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-556,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3697.364,3699.27,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Ward."
1983.82-556,2,33420,james_d_ward,,3699.27,3699.801,--I am sorry.
1983.82-556,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3700.114,3701.316,"Thank you, gentlemen."
