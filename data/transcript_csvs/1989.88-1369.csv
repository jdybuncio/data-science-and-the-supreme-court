1989.88-1369,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.977,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1369, Maryland v. Jerome Edward Buie."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,46.763,50.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.267,168.153,"Now, the Solicitor General suggests a test that may differ from that which you are suggesting."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,168.153,169.775,That is correct.
1989.88-1369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.588,195.853,"As a practical matter, what is the police practice on in-home arrests?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,200.808,206.181,There is nothing evidentiary in this record on that practice.
1989.88-1369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.148,256.504,"In this case, was there sufficient basis on which the officers could have obtained a search warrant at the same time they got the arrest warrant?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,256.504,282.412,"If the officers, at the time they obtained the arrest warrant, if there was a standard that required a warrant in such situations, we believe that a warrant could have been obtained, but that is... in a sense backs right into our bright-line rule."
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,296.521,298.143,May I ask about your bright-line rule?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,307.38,317.006,"I believe the, the best bright-line rule would provide that if the officers do not need to cross the threshold of the home--"
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,317.006,323.699,"Supposing he is ten feet... say he is in the hallway with his coat and hat on, and... what does the bright-line rule provide then?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,323.699,329.715,"--The bright-line rule provides that if the officers need to go into the house, which I think they would if he is ten feet inside the house--"
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,329.715,332.207,"What if he answered the door and says just a minute, I will get my coat and come right out?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,332.207,337.232,--I don't believe the officers could trust that statement if they are dealing with an individual who has a--
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.232,341.104,"Well, say it is hanging on a coat rack right in plain sight."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,343.708,355.144,"--If, if they cross the threshold, the best workable rule would be that the officers can do a limited and brief security check."
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.144,356.414,"Well, limited by what?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,356.414,357.446,Limited--
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.446,358.067,The size of the house?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,358.067,359.826,--Limited in two ways.
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.673,367.846,"But it's a three-story house, and he is in the hall on the first floor."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,367.846,368.875,--That is correct.
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.875,369.877,They can go through the whole house?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,369.877,370.618,That's correct.
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.618,381.817,"Well, why would that... why would it make a difference... if you found him out on the front steps, you couldn't go in and search the house, is that right?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,381.817,385.829,It... under the rule that we are proposing--
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,385.829,392.904,"Well, why don't you... you go in and you find him in the front hall, then you take him outside under arrest."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,396.657,402.05,--I don't believe that the record is consistent with that.
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,402.05,405.422,"Oh, you mean, you mean he wasn't taken outside the house?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,405.422,416.502,"No, I don't believe... there is a statement in the court of appeals' decision that indicates that the individual was... had left the scene--"
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.502,417.901,"Well, who do we believe?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,417.901,433.202,"--Well, the record in the case, the trial record in the case says that the individual was handcuffed, and then the second officer, Officer Frolich, Detective Frolich, went down into the basement."
1989.88-1369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.873,463.562,"General Sweeney, maybe the rule you are arguing for is a good rule, but it baffles me why it is a rule that is based upon the need to protect the safety of the officers."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,479.363,480.925,There's... there--
1989.88-1369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.925,484.268,"That just is... you know, that's just not true, is it?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,484.268,493.692,"--It is, it is going to be true in very many arrests that the necessary thing to do is to do a sweep of the house."
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,529.145,529.926,But that is a different rule.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,535.742,539.233,"No, it's a categorical rule like the Belton rule."
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.768,544.909,Right.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,552.766,554.717,"--Well, it's an objective test."
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.717,554.897,Right.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,559.301,560.553,It's an objective... it's an objective test.
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.274,581.657,"Well, I am sure the police chief would say make it standard operating procedure."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,589.914,590.773,"It, I would agree with you."
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.887,606.294,Do you expand the... do you expand the reason that you urge for making the sweep for persons to make sure that there is no person around that might destroy evidence?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,606.294,610.466,That is not this case.
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.951,629.399,"Well, I understand, but you don't try to include within your rule the advisability of making sure that evidence won't be destroyed?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,629.399,632.751,--We have not... we have not argued that to this Court.
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.408,658.369,If you find somebody there.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,658.369,659.982,--If you find... if you find someone.
1989.88-1369,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,673.209,680.454,"Do you think there is any inconsistency between your position and the court's opinion in Chimel, or Chimel, however you want to pronounce that?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,680.454,683.816,"No, I don't believe that there is any inconsistency there."
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.783,708.286,It also said you can't get outside that area.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,708.286,715.331,"--It said, as I read that decision, it says that in connection with the concern regarding the arrestee."
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.456,738.527,You mean to tell me that everybody has been reading Chimel not to forbid you to go in other parts of the house when you have an arrest warrant and you make arrest in the house?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,738.527,752.215,"--A... those decisions have read it when there is a search for evidence, that is where Chimel is read to go beyond the wingspan area, to prevent those type of searches."
1989.88-1369,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,789.211,792.373,Why do you want to go all the way to the fourth floor?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,792.373,795.265,"--I am sorry, Justice--"
1989.88-1369,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,795.265,799.93,Why do you want to go all the way to the fourth floor for protection?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,799.93,801.312,--That... that's correct.
1989.88-1369,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,801.312,803.303,Why do you need that?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,803.303,813.79,"Well, because an individual may be on the fourth floor, may be down in the basement, may be anywhere in that house, who could present a danger to the officers."
1989.88-1369,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.93,816.702,Not if he stayed on the fourth floor.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,817.794,821.357,"--Well, if he... if the police officers had the reassurance--"
1989.88-1369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.357,822.628,If you don't go up there.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,822.628,840.591,"--Well, that is, that... you know, there are many judgments that, regarding police practice or police procedure, that can be... can be... alternatives can be considered, police judgments can be second guessed."
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,889.356,893.91,You mention that one of the reasons for that was for the protection... excuse me.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,893.91,894.311,--I am sorry.
1989.88-1369,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,894.311,897.713,Why not search the house next door?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,899.745,904.969,That requires the crossing of another threshold.
1989.88-1369,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,908.362,910.225,It is closer than the fourth floor.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,910.225,923.405,"It may be closer than the fourth floor, but one of the things this Court's decisions have said over and over again is there shall be no breach of the entry, no crossing of the threshold without legal authority."
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.082,942.408,"In order to enter that house, you not only had to have an arrest warrant with you, but you had to have probable cause to believe the man was there."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,943.57,945.57,You had to have the--
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.57,950.835,"You don't need to have a search warrant, but... you can use your arrest warrant, but you have to have probable cause to enter the house."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,950.835,956.119,--I believe the arrest warrant provides probable cause for the officers to--
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,956.119,957.351,Not to enter a house.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,957.351,963.573,"--Well, the officers... if the officers have probable cause to believe that he is there, present,--"
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.573,964.634,Exactly.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,972.02,972.731,--That is correct.
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.731,973.49,Right.
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,979.795,1007.063,"Well, if you are lawfully on the premises, if you are... if the officers are lawfully on the premises and inside of the house, then the concerns that this Court has enunciated regarding the breaching of the threshold of the house, I think, are... the arrest has to be seen in context at that point."
1989.88-1369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.867,1017.58,"Only, only to hunt the arrestee."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1017.58,1018.7,--Only to find the arrestee.
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.271,1045.199,You mention that one of the purposes for the sweep search is to protect the safety of others?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1045.199,1046.088,--Yes.
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1046.088,1047.98,How does that work?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1050.762,1052.855,I'll give you an example from this case.
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1066.462,1070.115,"Well, that is substantially the same as protecting the officers."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1070.115,1070.375,--I am sorry?
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1070.375,1075.771,That is substantially the same as... the rationale is to protect the officers from an ambush or an attack?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1075.771,1082.366,"An ambush or an attack, to protect the officers, to protect others at the scene, to protect the arrestee himself."
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1082.366,1084.289,Just from an ambush or an attack?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1084.289,1094.033,I... for any safety concern that an arrest has attendant to it.
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1115.146,1122.222,"I was going to ask, suppose there is an unattended child, infant, left in the house after the arrestee is taken."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1123.955,1139.065,"That not only... not on the basis of the safety to the officers, that obviously is a safety concern regarding others at the... at the arrest scene."
1989.88-1369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1139.306,1141.779,Is that one of the grounds that you urge for the sweep search?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1141.779,1143.409,--We have not urged that ground.
1989.88-1369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.409,1147.984,"General Sweeney, how do you say that there is only minimal additional intrusion?"
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1166.898,1169.049,It is not a terrible intrusion.
1989.88-1369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.394,1187.774,"Different question, but not whether it is minimal."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1187.774,1191.147,I think it is also minimal in connection with the limits.
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.982,1202.385,Is it clear that it can take place after the arrest has been accomplished?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1207.159,1213.614,The pre-arrest is governed by the Payton v. New York.
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.569,1229.673,"Well, supposing in this case... I understand you say the record doesn't support it, but supposing the arrestee had been taken out of the house."
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1232.695,1235.249,"No, it's... in our--"
1989.88-1369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.249,1238.419,So you do not draw a distinction between a pre-arrest and a post-arrest sweep?
1989.88-1369,0,21558,dennis_m_sweeney,,1239.2,1249.397,--If the officers were... the post-arrest occurs after the officers and the individual are safely out of the arrest scene area.
1989.88-1369,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.109,1253.879,"Thank you, Mr. Sweeney."
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1255.782,1265.767,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1336.706,1343.749,"How would that unfold in this case, on these facts?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1343.749,1355.559,"--On these facts, Justice O'Connor, we believe that the police did indeed have a reasonably... a reasonable suspicion that their security was at risk in the execution of this arrest warrant."
1989.88-1369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1356.128,1356.558,How so?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1356.558,1362.175,"--Several factors, we think, combine to make that suspicion reasonable."
1989.88-1369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1415.124,1429.133,I am not sure that I understand why the mere suspicion that another person might be in the house amounts to reasonable suspicion that the officer might be at risk.
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1429.133,1431.514,"--Of course, Justice--"
1989.88-1369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1431.514,1433.397,"I just, it doesn't track, does it?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1433.397,1436.918,"--Well, it depends what you mean by the mere fact."
1989.88-1369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1443.024,1445.794,"Well, suppose that's all you had."

1989.88-1369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1463.707,1466.211,--justifies a walk-through?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1466.211,1467.05,Not at all.
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.228,1493.348,"Well, what about the woman?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1496.901,1500.274,"In this, in the present case... there was no way--"
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.274,1503.229,All you know is some woman answered the phone.
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1503.229,1505.98,"--Well, of course, it couldn't be... it couldn't be the accomplice in Mr. Buie's case--"
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.98,1506.258,Right.
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1506.258,1507.54,--because it wasn't a woman.
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.54,1509.441,So you had no basis for assuming the accomplice was present.
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1509.441,1518.777,"That's correct... well, there was no basis for believing that the one confirmed person in the house, a woman, was indeed the accomplice, because it wasn't a woman."
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.777,1520.84,"And there is no basis for believing she was dangerous, was there?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1520.84,1524.952,"Well, there was no basis for eliminating that prospect."
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.041,1543.838,"But you know what strikes me as strange about this case, the man was in the basement and he was armed, I gather, might have been armed, and they didn't go into the basement when they thought he was there, did they?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1543.838,1545.478,--They called down--
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.478,1545.988,Freeze.
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1551.883,1553.775,"--I think, Justice Stevens--"
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.775,1554.694,--that was about to shoot them?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1554.694,1573.176,"--I think, Justice Stevens, what they thought, or in any event what the objective factors would have justified them in thinking, was that in fact another person could well have been in the house and would pose a risk of interference with that arrest and a risk of injury to the police."
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.176,1576.328,Do you think there was a greater risk of violence by entering the basement or staying out of the basement?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1576.328,1580.312,"Well, I think that's that kind of judgment that cops have got to be allowed to make."
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.312,1584.916,"Well, but the judgment this cop made was I am not going in the basement until this fellow comes out."
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1584.916,1588.357,"Well, he took, I think, a less intrusive first step."
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.939,1606.82,"Mr. Robbins,--"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1612.763,1614.545,I think that once he--
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.545,1617.868,It would minimize the risk if he got that man out of the way first.
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1617.868,1622.1,"--Well, if the question is whether he can go back in--"
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.1,1630.198,"The question is whether, if he took... they got the man in the police car and they waited at the head of the stairs to the basement, after they got him in the police car, could they have gone into the basement?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1630.198,1631.61,--I think that would be a much harder case.
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.61,1632.191,I know it's a harder question.
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1633.533,1640.148,"If they were all entirely out of the house, and Mr. Buie was in the police car, I don't think they could go back in--"
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.148,1640.859,"No, no, no."
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1652.907,1657.221,"--On this, on the set of facts presented in this case, I think the answer is no."
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.862,1676.723,"Well, why is it any less intrusive to wait 30 seconds until they get him out to the car?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1682.829,1695.659,"Well, I... I am not at all persuaded that it would be less dangerous to wait... if they believed, as they did, that there was someone else present in the house, the process of taking--"
1989.88-1369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.659,1697.983,How do you know they believed someone was in the basement?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1698.884,1700.396,"--No, that's correct."
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1719.502,1720.724,Was that risk on the fourth floor?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1720.724,1721.915,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1721.915,1724.978,Was that risk on the fourth floor?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1724.978,1725.696,"I believe it was, yes."
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1725.696,1729.529,What basis do you have for that?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1729.529,1742.328,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that where you are dealing with weapons and an armed robbery and the possibility of violence, the fact that someone is on the fourth floor rather than in the next room--"
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1742.328,1745.24,Would that cover the roof?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1745.24,1746.472,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1746.472,1747.842,Would it cover the roof?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1747.842,1750.533,"Well, I think at some point--"
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.533,1752.636,"You don't know where it is, do you?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1752.636,1757.26,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the question is one of reasonableness."
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.581,1762.535,"Well, what about the reasonable rule that you should search the area where he is?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1762.535,1767.859,"--Well, I wouldn't... I wouldn't say it is reasonable only to search his arms reach, because the risk--"
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1767.859,1768.93,Why not?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1768.93,1774.214,"--Well, because the risk of people interfering with an arrest stem from more than the place where the suspect--"
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.214,1778.738,"Well, how can anybody on the fourth floor stop you from taking the man out the front door?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1778.738,1779.479,--By shooting him.
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.479,1781.59,From the fourth floor?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1781.59,1782.522,That happens all the time.
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1782.522,1783.683,When?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1783.683,1784.903,And I think the police are--
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1784.903,1785.263,When?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1789.968,1791.089,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.089,1794.379,You can't shoot... how can you shoot down through the floors?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1794.379,1800.493,"--Your Honor, the possibility that there can be ambush from rooms on a different floor is just not that far fetched."
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.493,1804.948,"There is a possibility that you could be ambushed from the fourth floor, if you are on the basement?"
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1804.948,1813.754,"Your Honor, the question is whether this arrest will be allowed to take place, and whether the police have a reasonable apprehension of injury."

1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1822.58,1826.583,--I think that would make it a harder case to justify.
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.583,1827.264,Would it?
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1827.264,1835.5,"The answer is, of course, in any other reasonable suspicion... as in any other reasonable suspicion is, it depends."

1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1857.398,1859.36,You want us to say fourth floor.
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1859.36,1861.16,--You don't have to in this case.
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1863.213,1863.654,You want us to--
1989.88-1369,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1863.654,1872.851,"--I am saying, Your Honor, that you needn't have a rule that precludes the police, in an appropriate case, from looking beyond the floor that they happen to be on."
1989.88-1369,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.249,1883.037,--[inaudible] many robbers in Versailles.

1989.88-1369,2,31261,john_l_kopolow,,1938.811,1944.354,"--Well, in this particular case the police had searched, apparently, through the rest of the house."
