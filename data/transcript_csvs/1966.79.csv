1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,35.514,39.931,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,157.656,162.829,(Inaudible)
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,162.829,171.868,They are raised in the cross-petition Your Honor by my colleague but they are not raised by us.
1966.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.217,625.433,To -- has to judicial immunity?
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,625.433,626.941,"There's a judicial, yes, Your Honor."
1966.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,626.941,629.913,You are referring now only to this judicial defendant.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,629.913,632.368,"I am not concerned with any other questions, Your Honor."
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,970.033,972.344,Is that what you're contending here?
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,980.558,1011.003,"We are contending, Your Honor that the judge here knowingly and willfully intend as our complaint alleges in paragraph 22 on page 5 of the record that the judge, so far as judge is concerned convicted and deprived the petitioners of rights, privilege and immunity, etcetera for the sole purpose of enforcing the segregation laws, customs, policies and usages in the State of Mississippi."
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1011.003,1013.289,Do you contend that that's corrupt?
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1013.289,1023.128,"I would contend that that is what is considered to be a violation what we considered to be a violation of the statute, deliberately imprisoning someone without any evidence in the record and that --"
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1023.128,1026.455,"That's not supported by that quotation is it, that you just read."
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1026.455,1027.614,I'm sorry sir.
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1027.614,1031.546,It's not supported by the quotation that you just read.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1034.194,1037.227,I would not -- I would not accept that Your Honor.
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1037.227,1042.401,"That's what I would like to know this time, that's your position with that --"
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1042.401,1047.728,Let me go back to my quotation.
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1059.144,1060.919,My trouble is what is innocence (Voice Overlap)
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1060.919,1061.533,What is innocence?
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1169.746,1175.022,"And he had jurisdiction -- the judge have jurisdiction, did he not?"
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1175.022,1175.838,"Yes, no question."
1966.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1220.024,1236.943,(Inaudible)
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1236.943,1255.932,"Absolutely not because the distinction that we draw and we think that Senator Trumbull who draws the distinction perhaps better than we can, we think that a distinction is here that when a judge knowingly to perpetuate an illegal custom such as segregation then he would be liable."
1966.79,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1450.192,1453.234,Is that -- is that the one about prosecuting (Voice Overlap).
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1453.234,1455.836,"That's a New Jersey state prosecutor, Your Honor, yes."
1966.79,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1461.457,1464.16,Immunity was suspended thereto.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1464.16,1471.186,By the Third Circuit Your Honor and the Third Circuit there in substance said that it was overruling.
1966.79,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1479.874,1486.566,"Well, does the Third Circuit hold there that the prosecutor is entitled to an immunity because the judge has decided it?"
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1486.566,1521.141,"Yes, as a matter of fact, it was precisely that reason that was partly judicial process and that prosecutor was part of the process and ought to be immune as a judge but even there, there the Court set en banc in Bauers against Heisel and there were four opinions either concurring only specifically only in the result and specifically saying that they were not going to go into the question of legislative history and two that rejected the -- they rejected the decision because the legislative history was on the contrary in Bauers against Heisel."
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1606.905,1613.093,Is it your argument that every judge who turned somebody to lose can be sued and has no immunity.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1613.093,1620.107,"No, Your Honor, I would say that the only judge who was liable is one who convicts with -- and not intending to deprive him of --"
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1620.107,1625.453,All of them could be sued for it and will have to prove his motive.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1625.453,1626.699,"Yes, Your Honor that would be true."
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1626.699,1627.796,That's your argument.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1638.708,1643.21,"On the 1866 Act, if he were shown to be in violative of the Act, yes."
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1671.598,1675.089,What about the appellate court judges?
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1675.089,1677.175,"Well, first it doesn't apply to federal judges, Your Honor."
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1682.283,1684.791,I assume that it could apply to federal judges.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1684.791,1686.346,"I don't see how it could, Your Honor."
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1692.366,1697.528,"Well, would that apply to Supreme Court judges of the states?"
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1697.528,1699.462,"I suppose theoretically, it could."
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1699.462,1700.365,"Theoretically, it --"
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1700.365,1700.525,Yes.
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1700.525,1702.042,-- actually would.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1702.042,1707.394,"Well, actually in the sense that yes they could be sued and if they were --"
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1707.394,1711.889,And they have to try on the basis of evidence how guilty they thought the man was.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1711.889,1714.394,"That would be so, Your Honor."
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1748.717,1755.878,There are few defendants who've been convicted who didn't think that they were deprived the right roughly and prove by the judge.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1755.878,1760.03,"Well, that may be true but in the case before us, Your Honor, that isn't the facts."
1966.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1777.334,1788.526,My questions do not mean that I would say that you are wrong but it seems to me like that's precisely direct statement if you may that the consequences of your argument.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1788.526,1794.89,"And Your Honor is correct and those are possible consequences of the argument I make and I would have to face that, put her back."
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1794.89,1806.207,"Well, what you've just said is narrowed and the position reflected by your complaint as I read it, your complaint does not even allege any motive in part of the judge."
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1806.207,1808.953,"Well, it goes to this extent -- I'm sorry, I should have brought."
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1808.953,1813.796,It does not relate -- allege any motive on the part of the judge.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1834.009,1843.788,"Well, I think, I am sorry but I would think that if a judge convicts somebody for the sole purpose of enforcing segregation laws, customs, that's spelled out a violation."
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1843.788,1855.786,"Do you allege here that a state judge convicted a person for the sole purpose of enforcing the segregation laws, customs, policies and you suggest are of the State of Mississippi?"
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1855.786,1856.575,That's right.
1966.79,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1856.575,1865.623,And usually state judges are supposed to do that and this is a supervening federal law.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1865.623,1905.679,"Well they -- they were convicted under the color of the state law, that is the disorderly conduct statute of the state but not because there was any evidence showing a violation of the state statute but solely for the purpose of convicting and incarcerating these people because the state contended to uphold the segregation laws of the state and if he merely made a mistake of the evidence, we would say that no matter how long it might be that we would not think he was liable but where he does it with the intent as we say for the purpose of upholding the laws, we think that spelled out the same thing that's going to -- it sums in the trouble we're discussing."
1966.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1910.448,1916.559,We'll get it from your brief.
1966.79,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,1916.559,1918.234,Mrs. Grayson.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,1918.234,1923.216,Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices.
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.98,2097.625,"Mrs. Grayson, excuse me."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2097.625,2099.246,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.246,2115.49,Did I understand you to say that your claim for judicial immunity here stems from the absence of any proof of corruption or evil motive?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2115.49,2126.728,I would agree with counsel that if there was proof that a judge was actually corrupt that then a judge could be liable.
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.951,2145.96,"Well, let's assume for the moment that a judge deliberately convicts someone when he knows there is no evidence whatsoever."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2145.96,2151.889,I presume that if you could prove that Your Honor I believe that they would be liable.
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.182,2162.83,So you and Mr. Rachlin essentially agree on what the law --
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2162.83,2166.957,Except to the extent to which that has got to be proved.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2198.76,2205.022,"May I ask you Mrs. Grayson of what, under what instruction did Judge Mize sent it to the jury?"
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2205.022,2208.193,There's no question of the instructions not being tried.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2208.93,2210.195,What were the instructions?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2210.195,2212.742,"Now, that I can't tell you verbatim (Voice Overlap)."
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2218.468,2229.974,"Well I know but I wonder, did Judge Mize submitted under some instruction that if the defendant judge were found guilty of corrupt or vicious or something like that."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2229.974,2238.373,"If Your Honor please, I will have to beg off on that one, because I don't recall how that instruction was worded or just how it was submitted."
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.373,2239.861,Is the instruction in the record?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2239.861,2242.578,"But when -- yes sir, it's in the record."
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.703,2281.773,"Mrs. Grayson, just let me pursue this other question just a moment."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2299.498,2299.866,Oh!
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.766,2308.579,So that is not what you're saying?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2308.579,2309.795,"No, sir."
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.795,2318.243,So he might deliberately decide to try a man of constitutional rights but that wouldn't make him liable?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2318.243,2318.76,"No, sir."
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.115,2353.058,What if the judge says well I know the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires equal service and public accommodation.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2353.058,2355.286,"Yes - no, I would say not."
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.286,2367.688,"And I know that the owner of that the public accommodations refused service and the judges, but I just don't agree with that statute."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2367.688,2374.59,"No sir, I would say that that was his honest conviction on what the law was."
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.59,2378.227,"Well, but if he says, ""I know what the law is I just won't follow."""
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2378.227,2378.806,"Well, --"
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.806,2382.507,Here's the statute I know that --
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2382.507,2386.806,"You're getting a little deep, if Your Honor please."
1966.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2558.478,2571.585,"Mrs. Grayson, where will we find in the record there statement to say were coming Jackson for the purpose of being arrested?"
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2571.585,2575.626,"If Your Honors please, I have to find that in my brief."
1966.79,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2635.532,2636.598,Mrs. Grayson.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2637.721,2638.438,"Yes, sir."
1966.79,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2638.438,2644.689,Do you agree that the -- or do you think that the complaint here stated cause of action?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2644.689,2645.54,"Yes, sir."
1966.79,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2651.668,2661.378,Do you think that the complaint alleges the necessary intent or will or attitude on the part alleges the necessary intent or will or attitude on the part of the judge and the policeman.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2661.378,2663.995,"Well, no question was raised about it at the moment."
1966.79,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2684.385,2696.21,"Well, I must say that reading the complaint, I don't have it yet been able to find the allegations with respect to intent."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2696.21,2698.064,"No, sir, they are not raised."
1966.79,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2714.288,2731.074,Do you concede now the complaint which does not allege a vicious intent or purpose on the part of the judge that placed the state's cause of action?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2731.074,2731.98,"No, sir."
1966.79,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2734.551,2737.054,It's nevertheless did not file a motion to --
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,2737.054,2742.725,There was no motion filed until after the conclusion of evidence to dismiss and execute the judge.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3006.852,3013.255,"Bradley and Fisher was in the constitutional position, was it?"
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3016.197,3017.318,"No, sir I don't think so."
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3022.287,3023.275,Common law immunity.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3023.275,3026.132,It was a common law immunity.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3052.811,3054.183,You mean under 1983 because this had no such purpose.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3054.183,3056.734,"Yes, had no such purpose."
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3056.734,3063.804,But what about this language that Mr. Rachlin has referred to us in the legislative history of the Senate versus the (Inaudible)?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3063.804,3070.964,He has picked -- he has picked scattered passages from the congressional record.
1966.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3146.765,3159.022,"May I ask this question, do you believe Tenney versus Brandhove as meaning that there is no liability because there's no corruption shown."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3159.022,3165.261,"As I recall, the case did not discussed the issue that it was actual corruption."
1966.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3176.937,3189.459,"But awhile ago you said that you agreed counsel that if he had done this, say corruptly, the judge would have been liable."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3203.79,3210.786,"If Your Honor please, I read Tenney versus Brandhove as merely saying there was no intent to change the common law."
1966.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3218.745,3219.28,Do we?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3220.108,3232.954,I think that that would go back to the common law and all Tenney versus Brandhove was saying was that the legislative Congress intended to change the common law.
1966.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3232.954,3238.229,So it depends on what the construction of the common law was?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3238.229,3239.211,"Yes, sir."
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.644,3252.36,And you suggest that the judicial immunity pleads the common law made an exception to that immunity in cases of the corrupt judge.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3252.36,3254.454,I think that it did.
1966.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3263.474,3266.782,"About ten year (Inaudible), I was in there too."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3283.37,3286.683,That -- because you will know better than I do.
1966.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3288.381,3292.311,I am not familiar with anything in it but I said --
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3292.311,3298.251,"Yes, That's why my impression was that it was not involved and it was not discussed whatsoever."
1966.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3298.251,3300.337,What they held was that he's immune?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3300.337,3301.621,Absolutely.
1966.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3301.621,3302.683,"At trial, absolutely."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3302.683,3304.398,And even though corruption.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3322.489,3326.861,Even though it did for legislators at common law?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3326.861,3327.254,"No, sir."
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3327.254,3330.367,You never thought that it did for judges at common law would also expect --
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3330.367,3331.064,"No, sir."
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3334.977,3340.297,You're leading a little bit on the side of the dissent in (Inaudible) cases.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3340.297,3341.796,In the what?
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3345.385,3350.316,I'm talking about my dissent in the opinion on the case.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3351.616,3354.408,Leaving that way.
1966.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3478.204,3480.927,Was it a suit for a false arrest or --
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3480.927,3482.296,"False arrest, yes."
1966.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3482.296,3483.244,Yes.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3483.244,3486.787,"Well, that would be true under Monroe versus Pape too, wasn't it?"
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3486.787,3492.355,Plainly Monroe versus Pape does not say -- it doesn't say to the contrary.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3508.689,3509.607,Without a warrant.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3509.607,3521.191,"Without a warrant and for false imprisonment case, probable cause on the part of the police officer is a complete defense."
1966.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3605.998,3610.34,"On this point, you disagree with the Court of Appeals, don't you?"
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3610.34,3623.979,"This is the point under which we petition cross-appeal, cross-certiorari on the ground that the Fifth Circuit held that probable cause was a defense to the common law --"
1966.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3623.979,3625.444,Not to 1983.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3625.444,3628.463,Not to 1983.
1966.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3786.786,3790.715,I know this case showed there was no violence.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3790.715,3792.083,That violence was imminent.
1966.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3793.698,3799.892,"Yes, not actual violence, just a possibility of violence, imminent violence."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3799.892,3821.673,"Under such circumstances, now the breach of the peace are valid as our court interpreted it can maybe can occur is the language of the statute but even if this Court should now six years later or five years later hold the statute unconstitutional, which I don't think it will that's not even pled, they didn't that it's unconstitutional statute."
1966.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3918.797,3922.982,You may complete the statement --
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3922.982,3948.078,"I urge the Court to give this case serious consideration because of its importance in the future litigation of the thousands of cases in the federal court and on the effect, it will have on the police force all over the country if they are subject to sue and subject to money damages with little pay in families and they are subject upon to suits for damages."
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3952.058,3954.814,"Mrs. Grayson, may ask this last question."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3954.814,3955.054,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3955.054,3958.219,Are you asking us to reconsider Monroe and Pape?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3958.219,3958.653,Oh no sir.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3962.822,3965.415,Well the Court of Appeals relied heavily on Monroe.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3965.415,3968.703,Yes sir and I think they thoroughly misunderstood it.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3975.218,3982.14,"Well, as I -- as I read their opinion they rely on Monroe and Pape in saying that good faith is irrelevant."
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3982.14,3982.932,Yes.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3982.932,3989.026,If in fact the color of the state statute would say tort was valid.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,3989.026,4003.071,They say it's inherent in Monroe versus Pape that the good faith under the state's statute come on excess under 1983 only was immaterial.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4013.652,4019.498,Well your answer to me is that you don't want us to reconsider it just to say that the Fifth Circuit misapplied the holding.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,4019.498,4020.095,Misapplied.
1966.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4029.647,4042.645,"And by definition the search and seizure under Monroe against Pape could only be illegal if there was no probable cause and there was therefore a finding when damages are found that there was no probable cause that took that defense away, is that your point?"
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,4042.645,4043.772,Yes.
1966.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4043.772,4046.525,Would you mind -- Excuse me.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,4046.525,4046.867,"Yes, Mr. Black."
1966.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4046.867,4055.805,Would you mind telling me in the Senate just what is the question the state presents in its petition for certiorari?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,4055.805,4058.693,"Well, the state is not here."
1966.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4080.169,4085.466,"Well, the police --"
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4085.466,4089.725,"In other words, if this is to go back, would you try against the officer?"
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,4096.09,4096.647,Yes.
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4096.647,4112.563,And you suggest that there has to be an addition of perhaps a reversal and affirmance of the District Court where the grounds that the issue of probable cause was properly in the case and was properly submitted to the jury.
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,4112.563,4115.066,"Yes, we submit it to a new jury."
1966.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4115.066,4116.006,If there is to be a new trial?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,4116.006,4117.54,On the new trial.
1966.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4117.54,4122.49,Well are you given under your position there has to be a new trial because there were errors of evidence?
1966.79,1,22318,elizabeth_watkins_hulen_grayson,,4122.49,4136.497,"Well, we in our brief we have said that felt the Fifth Circuit differed on error erred in saying that those were errors in the evidence but I have not have time to argue."
