1972.71-1553,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.404,"-- this morning in 71-1553, Gilligan against Morgan."
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,15.052,18.437,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,476.537,482.262,"The relief requested is injunctive and declaratory relief only, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,482.262,483.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,491.778,496.349,That is proper in the view of the Court?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,496.349,497.667,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.667,505.884,And there is no -- was there ever here in action for a damages as result of what happened at Kent State in May of 1970?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,505.884,506.897,"None in this suit, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.7,520.683,"But this lawsuit doesn’t involve anything, any damages for what happened there."
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,523.629,525.79,Yes Your Honor.
1972.71-1553,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.79,545.805,"Mr. Martin, my understanding of the general rule is that the prayer for relief is not a part of the complaint, and therefore, if the District Court is going to dismiss the complaint, it would have to conclude not only that the particular relief sought is not warranted, but that no conceivable type of equitable relief would be warranted?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,545.805,550.333,"Yes Your Honor, we contend that no type of relief is warranted."
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.28,572.157,"Your say, not even a declaratory judgment is warranted, that’s a form of equitable relief?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,572.157,587.887,"Your Honor, petitioners -- petitioner's interest in a declaratory judgment would be limited to whether the declaratory judgment would have the same disruptive effect upon the use of the National Guard as an injunction."
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.887,590.854,But your position as a political question would eliminate --
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,590.854,592.732,"Would eliminate all, that is right Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.099,615.026,Did you challenge standing below or --
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,615.026,616.384,"No, Your Honor, we did not."
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.384,617.739,Do you here?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,617.739,618.953,We do not.
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.953,619.892,Is it open?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,619.892,620.294,It is open.
1972.71-1553,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,625.513,634.026,May I ask why you don’t challenge the standing?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,634.026,651.753,"Part of it, Your Honor, is we’ve -- since we failed to do it below, we may not have realized that we could have and we believed that even if plaintiffs or respondents did have standing, there was still no relief which could be granted."
1972.71-1553,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,651.753,655.454,"On the other hand, if there was no standing, you wouldn’t have to reach all of those questions, would you?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,655.454,656.363,"That is true, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,656.363,661.482,And that would avoid these important constitutional questions?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,661.482,661.742,"That is true, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.742,669.822,And that is a -- not just standing a constitutional question itself with the -- but it isn’t a threshold that sits at the jurisdiction?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,672.472,673.563,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.563,678.784,"So, isn’t that a sort of a threshold question before you get to the bottom of it?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,678.784,683.745,It is a threshold question and it maybe we should have raised that issue but we didn’t.
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.745,686.09,Well this is -- is this not all over?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,686.09,687.595,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,687.595,689.476,But what about it right now?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,689.476,692.358,"Alright, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.421,777.555,"Where is a -- how is that change evidenced, by a directive or by a statute or by a regulation or what?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,777.555,784.645,It was changed by -- I’m not sure of the proper term of it; a directive or order of the Adjutant General.
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.645,790.841,"Well, I take that the record doesn’t show that, that the record before this Court, but is it subject to judicial notice, is it in a form --?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,790.841,799.099,"Your Honor, the only way it may show it is we filed a memorandum suggesting mootness which contained these rules."
1972.71-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.199,823.495,"Well, that’s another issue beside standing I take it, that’s mootness in the sense that there’s been some new law that has intervened, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,842.552,859.13,"As I construe their complaint, Your Honor, they claim a different interest in that they are students and the National Guard could again be called to the University; to Kent State University to control disorders."
1972.71-1553,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,859.13,874.333,"What about a student in another state, in another university where the regulations governing the National Guard were the same as existent at the time of the Kent State episode?"
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,886.984,895.375,"I’m sure he could better address himself to that, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1054.92,1057.486,But what line of cases are you talking about?
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,1057.486,1070.471,"Hague versus CIO, Your Honor, and the case is where a Federal Court has granted injunctive relief against certain conduct of a police department."
1972.71-1553,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1155.878,1156.608,"Thank you, Mr. Martin."
1972.71-1553,0,43103,thomas_v_martin,,1156.608,1161.783,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1161.783,1165.077,Mr. Solicitor General.
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1165.077,1167.746,May it please the Court.
1972.71-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1255.757,1258.285,"So, there is no state -- there is not state that doesn’t [Voice Overlaps]"
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1258.285,1261.492,There is no state which might now meet federal standards.
1972.71-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1261.492,1261.74,Right.
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1261.74,1271.166,"There have been in the past, in the distant past, but and indeed the present National Guard organization only dates from the early part of this century."
1972.71-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1342.756,1352.844,"Mr. Solicitor General, as I understand Mr. Martin correct that they just adopted these federal standards while this case was pending?"
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1352.844,1361.726,They have adopted the federal standards since this case was begun and I will come to the details of that in just a moment.
1972.71-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1496.63,1498.539,And adopted since May of 1970?
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1498.539,1505.86,By Ohio late in 1970 since the events and since this suit was brought.
1972.71-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1669.907,1678.81,"At the time when this suit was filed, the complaint was as I understand it that the Ohio rules allowed them to carry loaded weapons."
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1678.81,1680.324,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1680.324,1682.964,That’s what the suit was about?
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1682.964,1701.637,The Ohio rules which were then enforced are said out on pages 41 to 45 of the Government’s brief and I would call attention to what they were and the complete change between that and the present rules.
1972.71-1553,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1795.077,1796.224,You may continue.
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1796.224,1800.381,-- which he had some left.
1972.71-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1940.126,1951.533,"Mr. Solicitor General, when you say only equitable relief was sought, are you including within equitable relief, possibility of a declaratory judgment?"
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1951.533,1960.274,There is no prayer for a declaratory judgment except with respect to this one section of the Ohio statute which they lost below and did not seek to bring here.
1972.71-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1960.274,1961.871,"How about sub-paragraph, F the [Voice Overlap] --"
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1961.871,1977.171,"And I find that considerable to -- well, sub-paragraph F is such other and further -- granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper and I assume that this Court will grant such further relief as it deems just and proper."
1972.71-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.279,2048.4,But should we limit that to the new regulation?
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2048.4,2050.451,Is the Court limited to the new regulation?
1972.71-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.451,2051.061,Yes.
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2051.061,2057.38,"I would think with respect to the determination of the propriety of equitable relief, it was."
1972.71-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.38,2061.762,"And we wouldn’t have to approve of those old ones, would we?"
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2061.762,2063.934,"No, certainly not."
1972.71-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.515,2325.768,"When you write that article, have in mind Robinson against California?[Laughter]"
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2325.768,2329.619,"Thank you, Mr. Justice, I’ll be glad to add that to my notes."
1972.71-1553,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2334.841,2336.43,Are you open to other suggestions?
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2336.43,2339.599,"And accordingly we [Laughter] -- Mr. Justice, I’m sorry."
1972.71-1553,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2339.599,2340.874,Are you open to other suggestions?
1972.71-1553,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2340.874,2349.096,"Yes, I would [Laughter] I would like them very much and I will give credit in a footnote.[Laughter]"
1972.71-1553,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2358.063,2362.061,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2366.019,2370.538,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the members of the Court.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.074,2445.976,"It could be in any form of (Inaudible) everyone out there was saying, you ask for declaratory injunction and then you asked for the injunction, right?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2445.976,2446.986,"I have not learned in that way, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2446.986,2452.757,"Well, if you get an injunction, do you need the declaratory judgment?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2452.757,2453.673,You might.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.552,2461.83,"If you properly drew your injunction, would you need a declaratory judgment?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2461.83,2463.762,"No, you would not, but --"
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2463.762,2470.749,"I think you asked for an injunction and you claim is last thing, you also want declaratory judgment after that?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2470.749,2472.75,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.259,2509.136,But you’d never asked for a declaratory judgment?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2509.136,2516.809,"Well, it was anticipated, so that was the request."
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2516.809,2524.927,"Going along, I have learned a little bit and relating it to the relief that you were seeking, Mr. Geltner."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2556.64,2560.608,"Among the possible, appropriately some might be that --"
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2560.608,2562.98,What more would you want beyond that?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2562.98,2571.431,"At the time of the filing of the complaint, as the Solicitor General has pointed out, the rules of engagement in Ohio were highly objectionable."
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2606.645,2614.158,"Well, are there some beyond the army regulations that you would seek in the District Court if you go back there?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2614.158,2632.958,"Well, there are numerous alternatives, but at this point, the rules which are present in the appendices produced by the army are sufficient, but we believe that they deal only with a certain aspect of the case."
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2642.09,2654.201,"Would that satisfy you if a Court of Equity ordered, irrevocably ordered the State of Ohio to maintain the army rules and force?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2654.201,2655.652,Maintain the existing army rules --
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2655.652,2657.234,"That’s the new ones, yes."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2657.234,2679.788,"That would satisfy us as to the bulk of our case, but we perceive a substantial difference between the question of whether or not the rules are in force and the questions of whether or not the rules are actually enforced, and enforced over a continuous period of time by adequate training of the troops, by continuous training of the troops."
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2711.478,2730.156,"Well, if you have standing and if this is a justiciable question and all the other barriers are satisfied and the State of Ohio went back to its old rules, couldn’t you always on your theory start a new suit in equity?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2730.156,2732.374,"Well, I suppose we could."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2769.573,2772.641,How many of your clients are there in school now?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2772.641,2776.291,The three plaintiffs have all graduated.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.474,2785.162,"Well, who in the class is now at Kent?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2785.162,2791.929,The entire class -- the Kent State University student body is the class represented.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.503,2798.609,Have you sought to intervene any new plaintiffs?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2798.609,2801.333,"We have not sought, but we’ll seek at the District Court level."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2804.517,2806.487,What do we have now?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2814.98,2816.39,"I don’t believe so, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2816.39,2816.497,Why not?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2816.497,2819.328,"I believe at this point, the complaint stands on itself."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2821.092,2824.109,"Well, suppose they all drop dead?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2824.109,2824.629,"Well, Your Honor --"
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.629,2829.182,"Well, suppose all the named plaintiffs drop dead, would you still be here?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2829.182,2833.309,I see no provision in the rules for substituting at this point.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2842.475,2846.418,Have you asked this Court to be permitted?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2846.418,2849.473,We have not asked this Court for an order.
1972.71-1553,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2868.135,2869.15,Mr. Geltner.
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2869.15,2869.802,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2869.802,2888.683,I think it was Mr. Justice White who inquired of counsel for the state whether there is anymore reason why a student -- a former student of Kent State would have standing to bring this case than any other citizen of Ohio and I don’t think the question was answered.
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2890.058,2899.669,"Yes, Your Honor, I have a rather lengthy answer for that question because it requires an exploration of the entire standing doctrine."
1972.71-1553,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3060.22,3064.902,"They have been brought by students, say of Ohio State University?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3064.902,3066.16,I don’t believe so Your Honor.
1972.71-1553,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3066.16,3071.738,You had to have this background of disorder and action by the guard?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3071.738,3073.576,This is a very specific background.
1972.71-1553,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.922,3174.756,Is that like a complaint before us here?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3174.756,3175.574,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.574,3176.309,Why is that?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3183.035,3185.309,"That’s right Your Honor, we did not."
1972.71-1553,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.309,3195.959,And the District Court or the Court of Appeals just upheld your complaint insofar as it alleged in the theory of inadequate training?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3195.959,3204.311,"The theory of inadequate training, the theory of improper orders, the theory of improper arming of the troops."
1972.71-1553,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.311,3225.136,But it didn’t -- I didn’t know it anticipate that -- I didn’t know that the issue here was whether or not the complaint stated a good cause of action insofar as it alleged the actual breakup of the assembly.
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3225.136,3230.648,"Well, I don’t think Your Honor, that that question can be avoided."
1972.71-1553,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3351.241,3363.912,"Referring to Judge Edwards’ opinion, and if you turn over to page 18, you will see his summary of a question which he introduces from the paragraphs you have just mentioned."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3375.844,3382.674,I accept that as one of the four substantive questions which I believe his remand puts an issue Your Honor.
1972.71-1553,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3382.674,3383.477,One of --
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3383.477,3398.993,"One of the four, his statement of that portion of the complaint which deals with the unjustifiable killings and shootings is perfectly adequate and I fully accept that statement."
1972.71-1553,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.03,3435.209,(Voice Overlap) remanded to the District Court?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3435.209,3463.363,"It seems to me he has remanded all the questions because he goes onto hold, that relief is appropriate as to that -- those portions of the complaint that key question in part is the entitlement of one to have a judicial forum, here one's claim for relief and that those aspects of the complaint are distinguishable from those portions which he split off dealt with separate land --"
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3463.363,3484.188,"He says on the top of page 18 in the language that my brother Powell has just referred to, he says, the question which we think these paragraphs serve to pose, that’s all the paragraphs, A, B, C, D and then he is in this – and he makes -- and your summary of his understanding of all the paragraphs."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3504.437,3510.438,"I think that Your Honor, fairly read the complaint raises three questions which are admittedly lesses --"
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3510.438,3512.577,"Three other questions, four in all."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3512.577,3513.201,Four in all.
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3513.201,3513.582,"Now, what are they?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3513.582,3520.027,That are subsidiary to that matter and that maybe dealt with independently.
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.241,3532.192,"What if the District Court have an evidentiary hearing were defined from the facts developed before it, that an affirmative answer should be made to the summary question previously raised in this opinion."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3557.11,3567.214,"Well, Your Honor, it may well be that Judge Edwards saw those matters as a subsidiary to the question of the actual use of deadly weapons."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3622.924,3628.094,"Mr. Geltner, help me out on this breaking up of unlawful assembly."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3633.293,3647.64,The Court issues an order thereafter the -- the order enjoins the defendants from ordering them for beating their troops to breakup lawful and peaceable assemblies.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3649.713,3656.596,"It cannot be already under that injunction, now, the laws of the land."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3656.596,3661.394,"Well, not for purposes of a contempt power of the Court Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3683.92,3694.544,"Then the governor and all of his authorities have to make the judgment as to whether this is lawful or unlawful, subject to the contempt trial of the Court?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3694.544,3701.057,"On the ground Your Honor that they have in fact broken up lawful assemblies in the past, that is acted unlawfully."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3701.057,3707.799,"Well, may I carry on the suggestion of your friends that what case do you have at that point?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3707.799,3709.681,Hague versus C.I.O. Your Honor.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3709.681,3716.299,"Hague versus the C.I.O., which opinion?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3716.299,3720.863,The opinion in the Supreme Court which incorporated in part the opinion --
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3720.863,3721.521,Which one?
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3721.521,3724.756,There was no opinion in the Supreme Court in that case?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3724.756,3727.683,There were four opinions in the Court --
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3727.683,3729.679,"Yes, no opinion in the Court?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3729.679,3738.734,"My recollection is that at one point of my brief, I have traced down the -- I have got in the footnote here, haven’t I?"
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3803.684,3816.922,"I suppose if you were sitting as a court and you have an assembly of a thousand people, were throwing rocks, would that be an unlawful assembly?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3824.851,3831.028,"Your Honor, I can grant you one rock, Your Honor, which will mean a crime."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3834.265,3847.015,"We are not talking about rights under Ohio law, we are talking about of very nice phrase called Lawful Assembly and what a -- lawful assembly being one in which one rock was thrown?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3847.015,3853.074,The constitution does not protect an assembly in which rocks or a rock are thrown.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3853.074,3857.067,"So, if one rock was thrown, it would be -- it would not be protected?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3857.067,3858.378,That’s right.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3858.853,3865.436,"Well, so then the Government issues an order that if anybody throws one rock, shoot, you want that law?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3865.436,3866.564,You have changed the facts on me.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3866.564,3867.698,"Well, do you want that law?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3867.698,3875.026,"No, we do not want that law, but the fact -- the question is may the assembly be broken up as a consequence of one act to violence."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3884.648,3885.718,But it is a factual point?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3885.718,3889.963,"Exactly, it is truly a factual point."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3903.422,3907.997,"So far as we know, it will never occur again?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3907.997,3909.568,The conditions --
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3909.568,3911.093,"Well, has it?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3911.093,3912.363,That particular assembly?
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3914.065,3918.656,Has any other lawful assembly occurred on Kent State?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3918.656,3920.043,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3920.043,3922.513,And has it been disturbed?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3922.513,3923.302,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3923.302,3924.199,It has been disturbed?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3924.199,3925.25,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3925.25,3926.747,Where is that in the complaint?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3926.95,3928.205,"It is not in the records, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3928.205,3930.558,But why did you leave that out?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3930.558,3934.991,It occurred after the day of the complaint Your Honor.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3937.904,3949.415,"Well, what do we have that -- what do we have in the record in this case that entitles the class and what is the class as of now?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3949.415,3954.882,The class as of now consists of all students of Kent State University.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3954.882,3957.621,Which is a different class from when it was filed?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3957.621,3960.638,Which consists of different persons from when it was filed.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3960.638,3964.565,"And if we take a year to decide it, it will be still another class?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3964.565,3967.18,"Different persons, same class."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3967.18,3972.046,"Different persons, same class."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3972.046,3974.126,It is in the nature of the class.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3990.645,4000.761,"It is two-thirds of what both sides have told us, so 80% of things that were not before the District Court?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4000.761,4007.802,"Your Honor, we're in difficult position here because the fact that all we have got is a bad complaint."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4027.395,4030.233,You wanted the rest on the new regulations?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4030.233,4031.825,That is contrary point.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4053.883,4055.535,Does it satisfy you?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4055.535,4063.907,That would go very far to satisfying us.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4065.5,4066.605,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1553,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4066.605,4083.983,"You are asking them if you say it should be entered as an order of the District Court in the form of declaratory judgment, if that would have be done, that would require that we decide all of these constitutional issues standing, justiciability and so forth I mean --"
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4083.983,4085.184,All the threshold issues?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4085.184,4086.719,"That’s absolutely right, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4096.441,4138.192,"I understood Mr. Geltner and you told me if I misunderstood you to answer the question, my brother Marshall just asked you a while ago and the question was phrased in somewhat different way by the Chief Justice that assuming we get over all these and that you are right that these threshold issues are not obstacles and we get over and get to the mass, that you really wouldn't be satisfied by even then, by an order of a Court putting in permanently the present directors to the National Guard because while that might be alright on paper, your concern with the actual pattern of training, isn't that what you said to the Chief Justice?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4138.192,4139.52,"That is absolutely right, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4139.52,4147.514,And therefore you would say that the District Court has to get out there every week for two hours and watch the people drill in there?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4147.514,4151.716,The District Court has got to enter an order.
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4163.698,4171.232,"How would counsel going to know without getting out there in the National Guard on their weekends of training, or is the Court to send the master out there?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4171.232,4186.64,"No, I believe that counsel can be authorized to marshal periodically the nature of the training and to make available to the Court whatever evidence is necessary."
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4187.326,4188.926,How is this going to be done?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4188.926,4192.417,It could be done by access.
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4236.053,4259.498,"Now, I was just a little curious, I am a little curious as to how it is that the Court or you as counsel for the plaintiffs or the plaintiffs as individually, any members of the class can really know what the content is of the training when the National Guard goes on its training weekends, unless, the Court sends a master or referee out there?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4259.498,4267.798,"Well, the Court could send a master, the Court could authorize the attorneys or their representatives to appear and observe."
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4267.798,4270.177,"Well, is that what you think would be required?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4270.177,4270.645,It might be --
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4270.645,4274.145,"Otherwise, all you would have would be something on paper that you say is insufficient?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4274.145,4277.445,"It would not be required, it would be one of the ways to do that."
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4277.445,4277.836,But what other way would be there?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4277.836,4290.54,"All I can say Your Honor, is that that over the past few years, I have to come to know an awful lot about what the Ohio National Guard is doing on a relatively ongoing basis as a result of the availability of witnesses."
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4293.988,4294.819,"No, no."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4294.819,4303.503,"Its people are part time soldiers, they are soldiers on weekends, or for a couple of weeks during the summer doing the rest of the time, that's not any (Inaudible) secrecy."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4303.503,4308.266,What guidelines do you use for adequacy of the training?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4308.266,4316.962,We believe that we can produce expert witnesses testify as to the training as to whether or not it is adequate.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4321.922,4325.074,"Well, do you know what would be adequate?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4325.074,4328.193,I personally am not an expert.
1972.71-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4328.939,4330.836,Would the District Court would be an expert?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4330.836,4338.353,The District Court can be made an expert to the extent that there is not any other (Inaudible) to produce witnesses.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4338.353,4344.342,"That is a District Judge, who doesn't know a difference between a bazooka and pee shooter?[Laughter]"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4344.342,4351.196,"Your Honor, Courts hear medical witnesses, medical expert witnesses on a daily basis."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4359.161,4369.845,"And in the meantime, the National Guard got all of you all over the lot, watching everything they do and at the same time they're trying to train somebody to combat?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4369.845,4375.006,"Your Honor, it doesn't strike me as a very substantial interference with the National Guard conduct."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4387.451,4392.999,And the officers in the National Guard have been responsible for it?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4392.999,4394.319,Some of them have.
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4394.319,4397.739,"Well, they have all been changed."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4397.739,4400.879,"Well, the unit remains the same."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4400.879,4401.821,Have they?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4401.821,4405.915,"The particular defendants have been changed, but the --"
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4405.915,4414.081,Do you know as if now that they are not following the military regulations to the letter?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4414.081,4417.934,"Well, if you want me to go beyond the record Your Honor, the answer is that I --"
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4417.934,4420.772,"I did not ask you to go beyond the record, as your question."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4422.06,4423.048,Do I know for fact?
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4428.689,4430.947,Is it hearsay?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4430.947,4432.938,"Yes, Your Honor, it's absolutely right."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4432.938,4436.364,Doesn't that sort of persuades you not to talk about it?
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4436.364,4440.564,"Yes, you asked me the question Your Honor, I feel very uncomfortable going beyond the record."
1972.71-1553,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4441.342,4446.747,"I did not asked you to go beyond the record, I am just -- that is the trouble with this record."
1972.71-1553,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4459.585,4471.834,"I suppose Mr. Geltner, you would feel that had not the petitioner here moved to dismiss the complaint and succeeded that you would have had an opportunity to compile some sort of a record."
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4476.356,4487.041,"Your Honor, I believe as a District Judge has followed, I mean there is just -- it is a -- you can't criticize the defendant from making the motion to dismiss the rules authorize the defendant."
1972.71-1553,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4493.26,4497.884,Some motions to dismiss are obviously should be granted by the Federal rules.
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4502.234,4509.259,"Yes, Your Honor and this I don't believe is one of them at the time this complaint was filed."
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4533.019,4545.951,"But if the District Judge concluded either that there was no standing or that there was no justiciable question presented or that the issue was moot or all three, then he should not take any evidence, should he?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4545.951,4557.582,"That is right, Your Honor, except for the fact the question of mootness, as the Court framed the issue of mootness in the WT Grant case, there are really two senses in which a case can become moot."
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4606.556,4625.69,"Would it be a fair characterization of your position that if the case goes back to the District Court, you do not quarrel with the specific regulations now enforced, that (a) you want them made permanent and (b) you want a continuing surveillance to see that they are carried out, is that fair statement of your case?"
1972.71-1553,2,35891,michael_e_geltner,,4625.69,4627.36,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4853.957,4855.282,Thank you Mr. Geltner.
1972.71-1553,3,43103,thomas_v_martin,,4857.41,4859.789,I have nothing further Your Honor.
1972.71-1553,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4859.789,4860.405,Thank you gentlemen.
