1976.75-699,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.714,We will hear argument next in 75-699 Mathews against Goldfarb.
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,12.903,15.724,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-699,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.312,201.987,"Mr. Jones, it is been a while that I have read these briefs in this case, they might write in understanding that the basic PIA test is applicable alike to males and females."
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,201.987,203.643,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-699,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,203.643,206.656,That is only this additional test that differentiates...
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,206.656,207.236,"That is correct, it is correct."
1976.75-699,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,207.236,208.096,...between men and women.
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,208.096,212.739,The problem in this case is that the support test does not apply to women.
1976.75-699,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,250.095,252.305,Mr. Jones I am also a little rusty on the case.
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,263.526,266.146,It is not in the record Mr. Justice Stevens.
1976.75-699,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.064,463.979,"Yeah, but if he were -- if the genders were reversed she would get this windfall, right?"
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,463.979,467.245,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart that is the loophole.
1976.75-699,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,467.556,474.564,"Well, anytime if somebody does not like a provision of the law he calls it a loophole, this is a provision of the law."
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,474.564,480.336,Sometimes they call it unconstitutional.
1976.75-699,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.288,510.14,"Well that is the question in this case, isn’t it?"
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,510.14,512.828,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-699,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.746,744.235,Would it not be correct that the decision not to require a support test in the converse situation is just justified by administrative convenience?
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,744.235,748.802,It is justified by several factors and administrative convenience is one of them.
1976.75-699,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,748.802,749.123,What are the others?
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,749.123,752.515,It is not rooted in the administrative convenience.
1976.75-699,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.476,934.626,Does not your argument suggest that there is not necessarily a correlation between the ability to pass the support test and probable need at the time of the applicant applies for benefits?
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,934.626,941.447,"That is certainly true as to widows and it was truer perhaps, in 1939 than it is today."
1976.75-699,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.331,960.906,Would have thought for support test.
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,960.906,962.255,"Would have thought for support test, that is correct."
1976.75-699,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.47,1089.26,"But I suppose there are some widowers who are needy, but who cannot pass the support test."
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1089.26,1093.152,"It depends upon what you mean by needy Mr. Justice White, it is conceivable that there may…"
1976.75-699,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.152,1097.813,"I mean what is considerable as a support test, what is the purpose of the support test in the first place?"
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1097.813,1100.149,To weed out the non needy basically.
1976.75-699,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.149,1113.361,"Oh, yes to weed out the needy which implies that there are some that are not needy or you would not have to weed anybody out."
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1113.361,1121.221,"Well, I think as a practical matter -- well, it implies that some are not -- excuse me, I misunderstand you, implies that some widowers are not needy…"
1976.75-699,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.221,1131.097,"Well, my additional question was, aren't there some widowers who are needy even though they can not pass the support test?"
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1131.097,1139.683,"Again, Mr. Justice White, I say that that may well depend upon the standard of neediness that you use in a welfare system."
1976.75-699,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.315,1165.148,Has the man involved in this case ever indicated that he was needy?
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1165.148,1167.534,"He has not, it was our understanding that…"
1976.75-699,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.534,1170.377,Would the case here be any different if he had?
1976.75-699,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1170.377,1174.774,"Well, it would certainly be more attractive on facts for the other side."
