1966.164,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,724.589,725.292,-- the 4100 people --
1966.164,0,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,725.292,725.828,That's correct.

1966.164,0,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,726.584,727.183,That's correct.
1966.164,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.214,740.165,"But your argument doesn't help them, does it?"

1966.164,0,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,744.284,746.395,We're arguing for the 4100.
1966.164,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.825,754.714,And your argument doesn't support the position of the people who did settle on ninetieth.
1966.164,0,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,754.714,769.04,It might very well support their -- it might very well support them too Your Honor because if a representation was made that all that they could legally pay was 2% and they paid 50 times that.

1966.164,0,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,888.513,894.603,It was not a willful misrepresentation Your Honor and I simply suggest that you don't need a willful misrepresentation.

1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.903,2179.894,Now is that true here?
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2179.894,2181.474,That's the situation here because --

1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2208.315,2214.996,"Oh, had we -- had the payment been made at the post war rate, probably not, but --"

1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2215.135,2215.386,-- when the --
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.386,2222.43,Not that you ever insist on a statute of limitations against these people?

1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.625,2227.249,The condition of the statute just isn't satisfied and if they -- if you --
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2227.249,2227.553,"No, no."
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.553,2235.5,"If you say, we're going to pay you off at the post war rate which you did, why is there any insolvencies?"
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2235.5,2241.03,"The Government said that in its view, payment should be made at the post war rate."
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.506,2250.493,"No, but on that statement, right then and there accepting it was the claim -- was the (Inaudible)."
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2250.493,2251.584,No but we -- but the Government had --
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.584,2253.878,"Alright no, then 34 (f) doesn't apply."
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2253.878,2254.274,No.
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.475,2290.907,"Well, what -- where do you -- but what -- what do you suppose the purposes of putting the 60-day statute of limitations in 34 (f)."
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2299.32,2307.797,"Its function is to permit the fund, the account, the alien property account of the particular debtor to be wound up (Voice Overlap) --"

1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2309.478,2310.646,And equitably allocated.
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.646,2311.103,-- at an earlier date.
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2311.103,2312.563,That's correct.
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.579,2313.159,But then --
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2313.159,2320.576,"-- before payment was made to anybody here, there was this lawsuit brought by a large group of claimants."

1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.508,2352.37,And the choice is between paying these people or some claims funds.
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2352.37,2361.679,"That's -- well, that -- that is true and that's a -- that I think is a significant point."
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.479,2434.327,"You got this -- this is much -- the question I asked you, wouldn't really go to whether or that -- perhaps whether you could -- at what rate you have -- might have to pay but on your position -- your position is that you needn't even pay these people the 2%."
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2444.526,2446.446,Correct.
1966.164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.446,2446.826,Right.
1966.164,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2450.325,2468.815,"Is it your understanding Mr. Posner that all of these people, at least the main claimants here brought this class action were represented in 1961 by a law firm."
1966.164,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2482.876,2483.804,That's true.
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,3996.43,4000.624,I just like to clear up one facts of question.
1966.164,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4044.744,4045.746,Some of them did?
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4045.746,4046.418,Some of them did.
1966.164,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4046.929,4049.235,Including some of the parties for this litigation?
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4049.235,4051.765,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4185.676,4190.395,"I don't understand here Mr. Rauh, excuse me."
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4196.426,4197.558,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4197.558,4202.846,"So that they would be in -- if that's so, they would be entitled to the 2% or whatever it is when the (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4202.846,4204.189,"Oh, we get that in Japan."
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4205.492,4205.649,No.
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4209.947,4210.253,"Well, (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4210.253,4211.288,It's in the record?
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4211.288,4211.475,No.
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4215.513,4221.561,"Well, then you -- then what you're saying now and I want to be clear about this Mr. Rauh."
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4227.926,4234.294,"The claim, there was a timely filing, the claim was dismissed Your Honor when we didn't get send in the certificates of deposit."
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4234.599,4235.557,Alright.
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4235.557,4235.69,That's true.
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4235.69,4244.624,And so it's not just the manner of you're not having brought coinage in the -- within a specified time?
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4244.624,4257.91,I think it just -- it is the only thing the Government relies on is the fact we didn't bring the court action because we could have lost the court action when they issued the schedule in 61 without us on it.
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4262.487,4265.577,Now not -- for just a second.
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4279.731,4286.521,Because we did not bring suit within 60 days after the schedule was filed in 61 Your Honor.
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4286.521,4287.53,Alright.
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4305.629,4307.808,I don't think you have the second Your Honor.
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4316.686,4318.391,So they're ready to pay you what?
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4318.391,4321.225,At the Abe rate.
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4325.672,4326.086,No.
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4326.681,4328.116,"-- prewar rate, is that right?"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4328.116,4328.542,"Oh, yes."
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4331.71,4346.279,"I understand that but I'm -- what I'm saying to you is that you're not making any issue then of the Government's statement to you that, if you got a claim, I'll pay you at the Abe rate."
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4350.13,4350.798,Precisely.
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4373.758,4385.277,"But you're still indignant because the letter when it was sent out to your clients' awkward payment at the post war rate, is that right?"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4385.277,4386.136,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.164,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4387.232,4395.185,"Even though that you're now willing to take, I gather you're now willing to acquiesce and take 50% of the prewar rate, is that right?"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4395.185,4401.931,"Your Honors, 50% of the pre -- of what -- no, it's a 100% of the prewar rate Your Honor."
1966.164,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4413.035,4415.254,What was the interest rate?
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4415.254,4419.352,I presume it would be 6% Your Honor and that came to about the same as the --
1966.164,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4419.352,4429.813,"Well what you're saying Mr. Rauh, if I have put a $100 in, what I got was a $100 back $50 on principle and $50 on interest?"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4429.813,4431.75,Or a $100 on principle and no interest which ever (Voice Overlap) --
1966.164,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4431.75,4434.477,May I ask this one question.
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4453.677,4455.426,They might have Your Honor.
1966.164,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4456.041,4457.555,"Well, would they have had a defense?"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4457.555,4460.443,I don't know whether they would've had defense.
1966.164,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4470.317,4477.322,"Well, I gather the people who got the Abe rate the 1800 are all people who did two things."
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4484.292,4485.04,That's correct.
1966.164,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4513.852,4523.981,"Yes, but the plaintiff gets -- what I'm wondering about is whether they slept on the rights earlier suggests to the -- fairly to seek judicial review, is it really a just to the failure to file the certificate?"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4523.981,4528.361,"Well, the Government here is -- were addressing it to the failure to bring the suit."
1966.164,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4551.337,4560.943,"And you would say with the constitutional taking if -- in the situation I put through Mr. Posner, all these depositors in the American municipalities or states or --"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4560.943,4571.256,"Oh, I think they are in the same plates except we got a better equity in the sense that they're small people whose -- the savings (Inaudible) and who had suffered so much at the hands of the Government."
1966.164,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4571.256,4578.362,"Well Mr. Rauh, you really can't speak for everyone in terms of saying that all you're suing for is the Abe settlement."
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4590.27,4599.876,"At page 5 of our complaint -- at the page of the record of our complaint, we asked if they be paid in the same conversion ratio as the plaintiffs in (Inaudible) v. Kennedy."
1966.164,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4604.231,4610.054,"Yes, but you don't speak for all the people who withdrew their claim?"
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4610.054,4614.311,We -- I can't -- we have a class suit in which the -
1966.164,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4614.311,4618.454,You don't report -- represent those people that were paid off in yen?
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4618.454,4619.868,In Japan?
1966.164,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4635.773,4636.13,I understand.
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4636.13,4644.223,-- making that point but we are saying that the Government really now want to settle this after Your Honors rule if it should be favorable to us.
1966.164,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4647.069,4660.761,"But you have -- all the people that in this class you represent would be bound by your representations here, if that -- if we just assume that you won this case and extends the statute of limitations is not far to your suit."
1966.164,2,31596,joseph_lrauh_jr,,4675.697,4678.068,I cannot say on a class suit what would happen.
