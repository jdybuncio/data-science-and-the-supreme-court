2008.07-463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-463, Summers v. Earth Island Institute."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,8.856,27.733,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit's affirmance of a nationwide injunction in this case is contrary to bedrock principles of Article III standing, of the availability and scope of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, and the granting of equitable relief."
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,153.88,156.849,"Standing itself, I mean, it's a little unusual."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,213.003,218.073,Congress has not specifically said that they may challenge--
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,218.073,246.426,"Let's imagine that Congress did, Congress did say: By the way, lawyers who have handled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value has been more than $500,000 and who will sign an affidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch may appeal from the court's promulgation of the following general rule, dah, dah, dah."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,249.961,252.08,"--Well, first of all, I don't think it could be lawyers."
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,253.946,254.346,Right.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,256.948,266.32,"I think there would be substantial doubt that Congress could do that, because let me explain why, and this goes to a point that Justice Scalia was making in the prior argument."
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,276.111,291.454,"You mean Article III and at Westminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster, whatever they had, they must have had some procedural rules, and sometimes they had general procedural rules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look it up."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,301.977,304.143,"--Well, if -- if Congress--"
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.143,306.179,"In a particular case, I suppose."
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,306.179,307.812,"No, no, no."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,314.034,316.2,"--Well, if I could make, again, several points."
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,332.829,344.47,"Okay, then your answer is, if Congress says you can do it, have a general challenge to people who generally appear, your answer is if Congress says they could do it, Article III doesn't stop them?"
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,344.47,346.506,"No, I -- what I said, that would be a different question."
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,346.506,346.939,Ah.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,348.772,353.825,"Well, it might depend on a particular -- it might depend on a particular case."
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,372.704,384.762,"Mr. Kneedler, don't we have to assess the need for -- for showing a specific threatened injury on a -- on a somewhat elastic standard in a case like this?"
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,436.177,438.146,--Several answers if I may.
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,452.118,453.92,Assume for the sake of argument that it is made in this case.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,453.92,454.403,Okay.
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,454.936,455.672,What should you respond?
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,455.672,467.23,"--It is conceivable in a particular case that a person who -- who claims to be injured by that could sue to prevent that injury, but it would not be a challenge to the regulation as regulation."
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,480.701,492.926,"But your response to that is going to be, I presume, that in fact, absent a specific activity before the court, the -- the challenge is not ripe."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,498.496,503.567,"--And -- and -- and that may -- that may well be right, but that would be a separate question."
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.567,506.919,I don't understand -- I don't understand your response.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,534.605,536.688,That was my -- that was my -- and that was my point.
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.688,545.877,"And that would govern that particular action, but it would also be -- be precedent for invalidating the regulation in other cases."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,551.031,551.448,Right.
2008.07-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,556.102,560.236,"May I ask -- may I ask this one follow-up question, because I want to be sure I understand your position."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,579.634,586.038,--I -- I -- if there was -- if there was a category of cases in which that was likely to happen.
2008.07-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,600.963,607.117,You would agree that with that scenario he would have standing if his only injury in this is exactly the same as the plaintiff in this case?
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,607.117,607.467,--No.
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,611.438,612.738,He doesn't know that in advance.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,625.865,636.721,"--If -- if I -- if I could make a broader point here because there -- there may be certain categories, certain instances in which that might happen, but it is -- it is the exception, not the rule."
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.173,643.457,"I will -- I will assume for sake of argument it is the exception, not the rule."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,643.457,644.226,--But--
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,644.226,646.528,Let's assume we have got the exceptional case.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,647.778,650.813,--In -- in the exceptional case there probably would be standing.
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,650.813,666.406,"So that if in Justice Stevens's hypo one could show that there had been three or four or five instances of action so fast it was impossible to challenge it, there would with that as a predicate be standing to challenge the regulation as these people are trying to challenge it?"
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,666.406,668.023,"Not -- no, and that -- and that was the point I was--"
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.023,668.525,Okay.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,668.525,672.726,"--not -- not in the way they are trying to challenge it, because they are trying to challenge it across the board."
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,672.726,674.428,"Tell us how they could challenge it, then?"
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,675.194,697.758,"What they would have to do is bring a -- a -- on a -- a particular national forest where a particular person visited and visited a particular area and there has been a pattern of particular activities that occurred without his knowing, he -- he -- in that situation he might well have standing to challenge a similar--"
2008.07-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,697.758,708.816,"Well, if it's the forest next door that he is worried about and they have not tried a -- a -- a kind of quickie lumbering action in the forest next door before, he would not be able to challenge it."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,708.816,709.65,--That's correct.
2008.07-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.592,724.861,"Mr. Kneedler, why -- why -- why is that so?"
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,803.877,807.265,--If I could respond in several ways.
2008.07-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,825.06,833.832,"But this statute says says before there is a specific action you have a right to notice, comment, and administrative procedures."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,833.832,848.925,There is no indication at all in the passage of that statute that Congress meant to confer a judicially enforceable right to obtain those without complying with the usual APA provisions for judicial review.
2008.07-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,848.925,849.792,Maybe he has no--
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.792,858.198,Suppose the statute says anybody in the country can sue to stop a violation of the due -- due process clause.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,859.331,860.314,No.
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.849,868.051,The Article III requirements cannot be eliminated by Congress?
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,868.051,869.17,--That is -- that is correct.
2008.07-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,893.135,894.335,--Why is that different from FOIA?
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,906.157,917.381,"--Well -- and the -- the Forest Service has -- has procedures for notifying people of -- of proposed projects that were in fact invoked in this case, and we point this out in our brief."
2008.07-463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1086.353,1088.202,Could any one of those have brought suit?
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1088.202,1092.923,--Anyone -- anyone who claimed to have used that area could have brought suit.
2008.07-463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1096.708,1102.795,"But I mean -- but the letter alone, I don't know what the criteria were for the addresses."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1102.795,1106.397,Those were people who had expressed an interest in the -- in the project.
2008.07-463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1106.397,1107.131,"Oh, okay."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1107.849,1116.539,"And Mr. Marderosian submitted a 23-page comment to the Forest Service with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project, and that is the other declarant."
2008.07-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1166.35,1175.106,"Then you are saying that this statute is just unenforceable, because the statute is supposed to operate before the project?"
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1175.106,1178.308,It's -- it's -- it's by no means unenforceable.
2008.07-463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1200.423,1202.939,And that was before the project was undertaken?
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1202.939,1203.458,Yes.
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.454,1224.871,"Ah, but--"
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1224.871,1229.839,--and enjoined it and then the Forest Service withdrew the project and the -- and the plaintiffs dropped their challenge.
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1229.839,1232.255,"--And I am pursuing this, but I'm actually having a hard time with this."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1254.038,1257.74,"At some point that would begin to look like FOIA, yes."
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1258.24,1258.623,Yes.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1259.106,1259.456,--But--
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1259.456,1261.192,"In any case, I'm trying to make it look like FOIA."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1261.192,1261.725,--But--
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1261.725,1268.679,"That's just what I am trying to do, and you say yes, they probably could, at least if you are just supposed to get a piece of paper that says ""Notice""."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1290.211,1296.115,"--I believe it -- I believe it probably does, unless you can show that there is an imminent--"
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1296.115,1298.4,Suppose they did this.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1317.528,1318.844,--Conceivably.
2008.07-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.396,1322.348,I am looking for a principle that is going to help me.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1322.348,1329.586,"--Congress has not done that here and this is why I wanted to shift to the APA, because this is subject to review under the general standards of the APA."
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.333,1359.854,"Mr. Kneedler, I don't even agree with you that a -- that a citizen-wide notice provision confers standing, because it's close to the APA."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1359.854,1361.054,"No, I didn't say--"
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.054,1363.39,Close -- close to the FOIA.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1373.512,1373.948,--Right.
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.948,1375.181,--Of something concrete.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1375.914,1378.916,I didn't -- I didn't -- I didn't mean to concede that there would be standing.
2008.07-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.916,1380.185,"--Well, I thought you were doing it."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1381.052,1382.302,"No, because you are right."
2008.07-463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1508.499,1522.191,"Your friend on the other side says that that doesn't make too much sense because the issue in every case is going to be the same, a purely legal issue, and so waiting for the application doesn't make any sense."
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1522.191,1525.06,"Well, I don't think it is a purely legal issue."
2008.07-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1531.964,1533.583,The question is where do you draw the line?
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1533.583,1536.435,--And that -- that's why it can't be purely a legal question.
2008.07-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1553.98,1566.287,I thought that you said the government's position is that the line is to be drawn for cases that don't require either an EIS or an EA.
2008.07-463,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1592.438,1594.807,--But -- but that doesn't answer where the line ought to be.
2008.07-463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.233,1612.049,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1619.272,1621.874,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.817,1663.368,"What if there -- what if there was not a regulation on this subject, but the agency, by its constant practice, applies a certain procedure in all of these cases, would you have it -- the power in the abstract to challenge the agency's consistent application of a certain procedure?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1682.08,1688.083,The question of rightness in standing need to be treated a little differently for that.
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.487,1696.422,You would have standing?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1696.422,1699.624,"You would have to show, as Your Honor is indicating--"
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.624,1702.659,Your complaint is I don't like the way the agency behaves?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1702.659,1704.426,--Not on that pure basis.
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.578,1715.065,Why do you make a difference with respect to the regulation?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1728.04,1731.341,"Justice Scalia, I don't think it changes the standing calculation."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1745.501,1749.036,"The Ninth Circuit relied on it at least as an alternative ground, correct?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1749.036,1764.129,"Well, I think what the Ninth Circuit did was similar to what the court did recently in the Winkelman v. Parma School District case where most of the discussion was about the procedural harms that the parents of the autistic school children were suffering."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1780.405,1787.994,"Counsel, to read just one sentence to you from the National Wildlife Federation case, because I think it's the biggest hurdle you face."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1811.058,1822.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that needs to be read in combination with the footnote 2 to that decision, which says of course if you have a regulation applying a particular measure across the board--"
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1822.496,1826.15,"That's the Abbott Labs exception, isn't it?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1828.769,1838.058,"--No, I don't think that's the -- I think the Abbott labs exception is an exception to where the plaintiff cannot show that the regulation has been applied to its situation yet."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1838.058,1842.26,But that's when his primary conduct is nonetheless going to be affected?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1842.26,1842.743,Right.
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.743,1844.862,"You know, the drug companies have to do something."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1854.05,1854.584,Yes.
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1864.192,1870.762,But you have not pointed to a particular fact under any of these affidavits when it was applied to any of the plaintiffs.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1880.618,1882.737,We have the Burnt Ridge Project itself.
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1885.42,1891.842,You haven't shown any standing with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project on an ongoing basis because that has been settled.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1894.544,1894.944,Right.
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.948,1903.014,"So it's in for a penny, in for a pound."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1908.268,1913.339,"No, Your Honor, I would respectfully say that the focus is on the beginning."
2008.07-463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1944.025,1952.231,I think you never completed your answer in commenting on the National Wildlife Federation statement with reference to footnote 2.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,1958.451,1969.193,"Well, the footnote 2 says, of course, if you have a particular regulation applied to a particular -- to a category of circumstances across the board, of course you may challenge it."
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.893,1970.926,Is that all it says?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2005.316,2012.17,--There is many cases where it was not an effect on primary conduct yet a facial challenge was permitted.
2008.07-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.897,2096.907,"The problem they are asking you on this -- it was at least a problem for me -- I think it's tough on rightness is because the government is saying here: Look, you want to challenge it outside the context of a particular action that you don't like."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2123.274,2126.092,"No, Justice Breyer, that's not so."
2008.07-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.5,2139.101,You see where they are going next.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2204.608,2228.473,"--Well, I think even apart from the appendix, even apart from the assertion that there are -- the fact that there are certain actions that will receive no notice, I think the fact of the matter is we did what the court has instructed us to do, and that is we brought a facial challenge in a concrete example with the Burnt Ridge timber sale project."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2256.727,2265.765,"Counsel, I now have footnote 2, and it refers, as you say, to a particular measure that applies across the board to all individual classifications."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2308.759,2317.015,"Well, in that footnote, it's saying it's quite different from permitting a generic challenge to all aspects of the land-withdrawal review program."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2349.419,2353.889,"Well, it says -- it says, if it's become ripe for review in the manner discussed in text."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2369.649,2371.351,--But that gets us to the standing question.
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2432.99,2435.192,"That would be like in footnote 2, the general program."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2445.649,2454.088,"--Well, all I can say, Your Honor, is I thought we did that by bringing it in the context of the Burnt Ridge sale and then it's a matter of--"
2008.07-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2454.088,2468.163,"If you had had a ruling on where you draw the line in the Burnt Ridge case, then that would have been precedent for all these other cases, but it was settled, right, so you didn't get a determination?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2468.163,2476.352,"--Yes, Your Honor, we never brought an as-applied challenge to these regulations in the context of the Burnt Ridge sale."
2008.07-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2476.352,2479.22,But you are seeking a different line.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2495.665,2498.95,"Well, it's right in the language of the Appeals Reform Act."
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.443,2545.993,You need a permit to have a Christmas tree?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2547.678,2548.461,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.763,2551.963,I know what you're talking about.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2551.963,2553.632,"--You know, I get one every year."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2576.997,2581.032,You cut down a tree in the national forest without approval?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2584.401,2586.203,"I did get the permit, Your Honor."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2586.203,2586.703,Oh.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2588.603,2615.586,"I think the other kinds of cases that are useful to look at are, for instance, Blum v. Yaretsky for standing, and that was the nursing home case where nursing home residents that had been denied -- they had been sent to lesser nursing home facilities, they were on assistance -- challenged the way in which that was being handled."
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.088,2648.64,That's not unusual.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2671.673,2673.023,--Well--
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.023,2674.708,"That's quite different from saying,"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2688.448,2707.929,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I would suggest that the way those two cases I discussed the plaintiffs were treated is similar to here, where you have members who -- it's uncontroverted that they are constantly using the national forests and commenting on forest appeals."
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.39,2731.175,Tell me the two cases again that you are relying on for this.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2731.175,2739.214,"Blum v. Yaretsky, and that we cite in our brief; and then Northeastern Florida Chamber of Contractors v. Jacksonville."
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.816,2741.766,And what's that?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2743.1,2747.72,508 U.S. 656 1993.
2008.07-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2812.643,2815.279,Can I go back to standing for a minute.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2815.279,2815.979,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2815.979,2818.881,You may have looked this up and may have found something here.
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2897.266,2902.487,"Well, Justice Breyer, you know, of course our case is not that typical because we think we have on the--"
2008.07-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2902.487,2903.587,You think you are like the second?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,2903.587,2904.137,--Right.
2008.07-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.166,2977.451,Can I ask you about Northeastern Florida?
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3060.739,3063.307,But I think the record supports the same kind of assertion.
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3082.768,3083.868,"And where is ""there""?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3086.803,3094.992,"He would like to go back to the areas in -- where those 20 timber sales are, some of which he had been to before and would like to return to."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3133.531,3136.8,"This isn't one of those after-submitted declarations, is it?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3136.8,3139.001,--That -- that latest one I referred to is.
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3139.618,3145.655,"Well, don't we generally not look at after-submitted declarations in determining standing?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3145.655,3148.523,"Your Honor, I don't think that is correct."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3155.511,3159.998,"So if you -- if yesterday you submitted a declaration, we would look at that?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3159.998,3179.21,"Well, the cases that the government provided for rejecting declarations were offers submitted to this Court or certainly an appellate court and I agree that is more problematic, or it would have been more problematic if the district court had excluded the documents and said it's not going to look at them."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3218.018,3222.488,"The later filed, where along the district court proceedings were they filed?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3222.488,3233.01,"--They were submitted -- after the judgment setting aside the regulations, there was litigation over the government's stay motion pending appeal."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3233.01,3237.645,"So if you lose that again, you figure, well, I've got some more -- I can get some more declarations."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3259.442,3262.244,"Well, the -- the district court didn't find a flaw."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3283.276,3284.743,"You filed them after judgment, right?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3284.743,3285.393,--We did.
2008.07-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3355.503,3373.631,"Do you want to say a word about the Ninth Circuit making a law for the entire nation, on a controversial question that normally the court would just rule for its own area?"
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3373.631,3397.413,"Well, I think there is a difference, Your Honor, between setting aside a regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act and what would normally be some sort of nationwide injunction such as where you had, say, challenged a local timber -- local forest service district for not analyzing NEPA correctly, and the Court not only set aside that action but said, and"
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3433.15,3434.252,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-463,1,36167,matt_kenna,,3434.252,3435.919,"Thank you, Your Honors."
2008.07-463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3435.919,3439.49,"Mr. Kneedler, you have three minutes."
2008.07-463,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3439.49,3442.442,"Several points, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-463,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3494.355,3495.124,That is not what it says.
2008.07-463,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3498.493,3500.059,--He was talking about injunction.
2008.07-463,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.111,3502.745,I thought you were talking about--
2008.07-463,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3502.745,3509.8,--ripeness under the APA but it ties in -- it ties into the injunctive relief if I just could address that for the moment.
2008.07-463,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3636.079,3637.614,Thank you Mr. Kneedler.
