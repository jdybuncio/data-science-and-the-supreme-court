1966.343,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,36.078,Number 343 Prima-Paint-Corporation petitioner versus Flood and Conklin Manufacturing Company.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,37.774,43.736,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,842.28,848.038,"Just hold on, can I ask you this question?"
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,858.609,860.238,That's correct Mr. Justice Fortas.
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,860.238,867.966,And is there a difference between you and your adversary as to what New York Law is on this subject?
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,910.625,910.939,Yes.
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,911.342,913.749,I haven't seen it cited in the brief.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,913.749,924.675,"I didn't cite it in the reply brief but I know it is distinguishable as are the other cases, when the facts of the case are pierced out."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,948.69,949.66,In this case?
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,949.66,963.33,"That's right, the only New York case and Judge Wayte concludes that fabrics if not distinguishable then the decision must be considered with great -- that's appendix 8A in the reply brief Your Honor."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,973.353,975.124,That's still another case.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,975.124,977.403,"Yes, Your Honor but to get you --"
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,977.403,981.035,That is a case in 200 New York something in an earlier case.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,981.035,982.032,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1007.385,1009.116,It was approved by the appellate division.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1009.116,1034.137,"Yeah, but the highest court here is the Court of Appeals which has annunciated the (Inaudible) which is discussed at length in Judge Wyatt decision which is a part of the appendix and we say that this Court, the Federal Courts must look to the highest Court of the State in order to determine what its precedent is."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1049.944,1063.184,"In the Amphenol case, Justice (Inaudible) distinguishes the (Inaudible) case."
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1063.184,1064.4,That is correct.
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1064.4,1069.752,He says that in that case there's very narrow arbitration clause.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1069.752,1078.033,"Well, the petitioner relies on the analysis of (Inaudible) which Judge Waytt sets forth there."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1095.304,1105.444,And I suppose when we have to rely on what you had said a moment ago that is to say that maybe some movement in New York Law.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1105.444,1126.666,"There may be Your Honor, but I want to point out that the Lawrence case which is the precedent, here the petitioner is seeking to revoke or overturn in 1960 Judge Medina admitted in the record in the decision that New York Law was contrary and use that as an assumption arriving at its decision."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1195.927,1198.22,(Inaudible)
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1198.22,1200.053,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1200.053,1202.446,(Inaudible)
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1202.446,1208.702,"I believe only three or four had Arbitration Acts New Jersey, New York and perhaps one of them."
1966.343,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1208.702,1217.345,(Inaudible)
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1217.345,1226.504,"No, Your Honor the Arbitration Act that Congress passed was patented on the New York Act which had been passed five years earlier."
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.848,1442.789,What would you think if the state statute said arbitration agreements shall not be enforceable?
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1442.789,1447.286,"I would say that, that is a policy of the state and its citizens to (Inaudible)."
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.286,1461.252,And then you have a transaction affecting commerce and the contract calling for arbitration and one of the party sues the other in a contest of dispute to enforce arbitration.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1465.86,1470.504,I would say that the Federal Court should apply the state law because --
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.504,1471.678,And they are not enforced --
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1471.678,1485.41,"That's correct your honor I don't believe that the Court applying the common law of the state can possibly be considered invidious restraint on interstate commerce, if we the commerce –-"
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.41,1494.294,Are you saying that Congress doesn't have the power to require arbitration agreements to be enforced in transactions effect of commerce.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1494.294,1501.92,"Well, I think Congress may have but they didn't intend it, when they framed this act."
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.864,1507.829,That they shall be valid and enforceable.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1507.829,1561.742,"Well that means that they are revocable but it doesn't mean that they are well, I should say that they are not revocable that they are valid and I say that the state Court that the Federal Court sitting in such a situation your honor, must find it must apply the state law and then perhaps in those cases a policy decision what we have to be made as to whether the contract is to be deemed valid because of the commerce powers or the powers the Congress to regulate contracts touching on these or to determine that this was not the intent of Congress to legislate into this area and to deem it that the state law to apply and the contract will thus be move forward as far as the arbitration cause concerned."
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1561.742,1583.633,"What if the Court decided that this statute was to be construed as meaning that Congress really didn't intend to enforce arbitration contracts in interstate transaction despite provisions of local law you would -- would you, is part of your position that that is an unconstitutional."
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1583.633,1603.34,"Well, I would say if you are going to find a constitutional basis that it was article 1 the Commerce Clause, and that the Act was then substantive, you than run into the Erie doctrine in where you are going to have the situation that non citizens are going to have a different result as opposed to litigation involving diversity of citizens."
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.63,1632.696,And nobody suggests that Erie means that a dependent in the diversity suit may not invoke a federal statute as a defense.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1632.696,1652.56,"Well, with the preemption doctrine Your Honor you could then claim that the Court could then find that the state law was preempted to the extent of the federalization of the arbitration and that thus the contract, the arbitration clause itself was valid, irrevocable and enforceable."
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.56,1657.022,"There is a question -- very much different here is that, what we --."
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1657.022,1670.302,"Yes, I think so there is no national policy involved sir in this case, Lincoln Mills and the other cases will come under the NLRA and the Labor Acts in which there was a strong national policy."
1966.343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.148,1681.514,Now is that's supposed to be -- one simply said the labor contracts are to be enforceable but (Inaudible) enforced.
1966.343,0,39452,robert_p_herzog,,1687.704,1717.298,"Yes, but we still feel that there was that the rational differences that there is a concurrent power here between the state Congress and arbitration didn't want to outlaw all interstate, all state contacts with commerce -- they just wanted to prevent restrains that would impede the free flow of commerce and we don't see how this policy of holding the Federal Act that the state law is applicable can be considered impeding of commerce."
1966.343,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1747.454,1748.689,Mr. Coleman.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,1748.689,1752.863,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please this honorable Court."
1966.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1882.888,1884.138,In the Amerteron case.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,1884.138,1895.163,"Yes sir, but I submit that that's irrelevant, because had this case come out of the state of Vermont which as this Court found in Bernhardt would not have sent it to arbitration."
1966.343,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1902.711,1911.924,Except that it's kind of a lot of argument about nothing if the result would be the same under the national law or the state law.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,1911.924,1919.244,"Your Honor that's exactly right, and in our brief in opposition to granting of certiorari in this case we pointed that out."
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1925.087,1929.848,"Yeah but that's -- you would concede that is not crystal clear, the law of New York is not crystal clear."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,1929.848,1933.144,"Certainly, certainly the Court of Appeals has not yet spoken."
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.144,1936.22,"And as far as the Court of Appeals has spoken, it's spoken the other way."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,1936.22,1944.168,"That is correct, well they clearly haven't spoken the other way, it spoke to an arbitration agreement which was not nearly as to this point."
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1944.168,1945.44,Of a different time.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,1945.44,1953.497,"And it's under that arbitration agreement, the parties did not agree to sent through it to the arbitrator, that's what it said."
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.497,1957.11,What Courts of Appeals agree with the Second Circuit?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,1957.11,1958.0,Excuse me sir.
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.0,1961.542,What Courts of Appeals agree with the Second Circuit?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,1961.542,1977.524,"Well, since Robert Lawrence was decided the Third Circuit explicitly endorsed it, the Fifth Circuit endorsed it although they endorsed it in a case which was then reversed by this Court on other grounds, that's the Mosley case."
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.811,2006.451,So there are several others who have very expressly disagreed with it?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2006.451,2020.518,Since the decision in Robert Lawrence came down in 1959 the First Circuit questioned it in a case where it really didn't matter because they sent the matter to arbitration anyway.
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.518,2022.113,What about the Ninth Circuit?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2022.113,2025.31,The Ninth Circuit has not spoken since Robert Lawrence Your Honor.
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.31,2030.072,Has any circuit disagreed with Robert Lawrence before of course?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2030.072,2032.276,Not to my knowledge Your Honor.
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.87,2041.476,There was conflict on what Robert Lawrence was granted.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2041.476,2047.893,"Yes, well, yes that is correct when Robert Lawrence was granted the Ninth Circuit had previously said that they were --"
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.893,2050.349,Now they changed their mind about that.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2050.349,2055.512,"Well, they never -- apparently, they never had another case dealing with the question one way or the other."
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.512,2058.578,So there is an outstanding concept in the Second and Ninth Circuit.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2058.578,2063.583,"And the ninth that is correct, that is correct."
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.058,2106.707,How do you get the federal court to enforce an interstate arbitration agreement in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2106.707,2115.035,The only way you get into Federal Court is under Title 28 which includes of course diversity of citizenship.
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.568,2124.486,Well why is that?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2135.142,2142.61,"You mean in order to get into Federal court, well if I may answer you in a roundabout way, I like to --"
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.61,2150.995,"The statute here and that this was a diversity case, in fact the plaintiff didn't plead in the Federal question, but you pleaded a -- well you pleaded Federal defense."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2150.995,2152.057,That's correct.
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.057,2163.183,"Now what if that had been turn around would you, why could you – you sued in the Federal court, if the Federal question to enforce your arbitration."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2163.183,2183.466,"No, Section 4 of the Act, which is the section that allows a Federal court to order arbitration, seems to state quite clearly that you need grounds other than the arbitration act to get into the Federal court, but I don't think that meets our problem."
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2183.466,2185.862,The suit they brought against you in the state court.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2185.862,2186.615,That's exactly --
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.615,2187.852,But it was certainly fair --
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2187.852,2193.938,"Yes sir, we say we could have and we say that there is no problem of forum shopping because the state courts --"
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2193.938,2200.179,Could you have gone into the state courts and asked it on the basis of --
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2200.179,2209.396,This is definitely our contention that the state courts will now have to apply this Federal law because Congress exercised its commerce power --
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2209.396,2212.734,It compliments to what we have held is the case of (Inaudible)
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2212.734,2216.956,"Exactly, exactly."
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.922,2273.437,"Yet you don't well seem to argue in your brief or discuss the question whether or not this particular contract under the commerce law, whether this is commerce, this employment commission."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2273.437,2275.057,"Yes, Sir, we do mention this in our brief."
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.057,2278.18,"You mentioned it, I don't see any development."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2278.18,2279.39,We really --
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.39,2286.552,I would think you are fair and would make almost any employment contract with any industrial company in interstate commerce contract.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2286.552,2296.316,"Mr. Justice Douglas we do not argue that we have an employment contract here, this is a characterization put on the contract by petitioner not by us."
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.316,2305.078,"I know but I think you take your position, I don't see how we could avoid calling that almost any employment contract with any company like General Electric, DuPont."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2305.078,2306.674,"No sir, no sir."
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.674,2307.453,In interstate commerce.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2307.453,2311.035,"No sir, because this is not an employment contract we have, what we have here --"
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.035,2318.129,"I know it isn't but I'd say if we take your position I don't see how we can help taking the next one, what would be the distinction?"
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2318.129,2319.218,The distinction --
1966.343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.218,2323.737,"If your case had an employment -- my employment contract with General Electric, you must --"
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2323.737,2334.443,"All right in my case I filled assets and those assets were located in number of the states, those assets were the lists of my customers."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2363.388,2365.706,Did the contract state law building?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2365.706,2368.442,No sir it did not.
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2368.442,2382.003,"Did it give the right that I understand that many contracts here in New York, order who made the contract to accept service on part of other people who lived in other states."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2382.003,2383.245,No sir it does not.
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2384.114,2406.83,"If that is kind of law in New York in order you have arbitration agreement followed thereafter and we tear it out having abandoned a new contract was made as a trainee in fact for a man located in the state of Washington, is that a part of the law of New York?"
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2406.83,2410.297,"Your Honor, I don't know, but I would hope it's not."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2410.297,2414.872,"Well, I think maybe you will find it here."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2414.872,2416.632,"However, however here --"
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2416.632,2431.777,"Except that some sense being provided for by the person to whom the contract was made, a person living in California or even in China, I won't say China, but other eastern countries."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2431.777,2441.349,"Well, Your Honor I believe you are referring to this National Equipment Rental case of this court two or three years ago."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2444.255,2446.955,But that is the Law of New York.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2446.955,2448.493,"Well, that was the law of this court --"
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2448.493,2451.978,Was that -- it was clearly not written by Judge Medina.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2451.978,2470.664,"The National Equipment Rental case Your Honor is a case of this court in 1964, where in a 5:4 decision, the court upheld a clause in a form contract where a Michigan Farmer authorized somebody in New York to accept service for him for a --"
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2470.664,2475.078,"And the relative of the President of the company, the contract was made excepted to serve."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2475.078,2478.661,"That's correct, that is a holding of this court in a five to four --"
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2478.661,2480.101,That is under arbitration law of New York.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2480.101,2487.185,"No sir, no sir that was not under arbitration law that was to avail oneself of the courts of New York."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2487.185,2490.193,"Of the courts –- but wasn't an arbitration, it was not an arbitration?"
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2490.193,2493.892,"Was not an arbitration, it was litigation."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2493.892,2501.056,But they have had arbitrations done in the same way it happened in New York under its law.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2501.056,2506.928,"I don't know of that Your Honor, I would say, I would say if they did, I wouldn't be happy with it."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2515.874,2525.086,"Why does he have to agree, why couldn't New York have the law that all occasions rising out of interstate commerce."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2528.998,2536.609,"Well, that would be taking away a person's right to, I think they would be denying a person a constitutional right to go to court."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2589.934,2601.238,They made pretty strong provisions in the law which get powers from the old doctrine that a person could not in advance of a law suit waive his right to have a trial in court.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2601.238,2616.667,"That is correct, that was the common law here, the common law for as far as I know from the ancient days before this republic had a hostility to arbitration on the theory that it divested the courts of its jurisdiction."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2616.667,2617.313,Which it does.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2617.313,2624.421,Which it does and the common law in the few states today which do not have arbitration statutes is still that way.
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2629.894,2635.117,Which was subjected to charges that was unconstitutional.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2635.117,2636.611,The statute—
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2636.611,2637.157,Wasn't it?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2637.157,2638.589,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2638.589,2640.388,Wasn't it in the Erie?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2640.388,2643.552,Erie did not speak to this statute to the arbitration.
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2643.552,2648.207,I am talking about the Congressional enactment.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2648.207,2649.613,The Congressional enactment.
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2649.613,2650.877,That arbitrational law.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2650.877,2659.418,That arbitration has to my knowledge which maybe incomplete as to my knowledge never been challenged as unconstitutional.
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2684.508,2692.005,You could think about that in event of the contract being made or a law suit having arisen.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2692.005,2708.43,"That is right, well, if you first have to wait for a dispute to arise before you agreed on whether or not you will arbitrate it is usually to the advantage of one party, not to arbitrate because he is in no hurry for a quick result."
1966.343,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2722.779,2725.127,Not any doubt about that --
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2725.127,2737.84,"And I do not believe that in this case we are challenging the Act as unconstitutional, petitioner argues that the Act runs up against Erie problems we don't believe it does."
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.642,2773.166,"Tell me Mr. Coleman, as you said earlier that you couldn't get into Federal Court really on the basis that the Act itself, I gather that's because of that phrase that is Section 4, say for such agreement."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2773.166,2774.166,Yes sir.
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2774.166,2776.52,"Well that, is that tied against your proposition?"
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2776.52,2778.403,"I don't believe, no I don't believe --"
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2778.403,2780.215,What does that clause mean?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2781.361,2781.87,We couldn't get into --
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2781.87,2785.901,The court without an agreement -- without an arbitration given to this context.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2785.901,2786.11,That's correct.
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2786.11,2788.25,In this context you can't get in without--
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2788.25,2801.673,"So you need to see any two things, you need the arbitration agreement or you need three things, you need the arbitration agreement, you need a contract in interstate commerce and you need diversity of citizenship to get into the Federal Court, without the diversity --"
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2801.673,2810.336,"Why would the Congress say, if this, if I think we have already -- we have positioned it that this creates a Federal right."
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2810.336,2811.222,That is correct.
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2811.222,2814.291,And that it's a right that has to be applied by state court.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2814.291,2815.137,Absolutely.
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2815.137,2823.767,And yet you conceive that because of this language you can't get into the Federal Court merely on that basis to enforce that Federal right.
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2823.767,2828.045,"Well, there you are Your Honor, you have with arbitration -- you have something--"
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2828.045,2828.557,Well I mean --
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2828.557,2829.469,Quite unique.
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2829.469,2832.046,Why did Congress do that?
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2843.341,2851.555,"Well, I don't, -- I frankly don't think the Congress when it passed this law gave – thought one way or the other as to its applications to the state."
1966.343,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2851.555,2854.919,"Is there any, is there any history why that's safe with agreement --?"
1966.343,1,35565,martin_a_coleman,,2854.919,2857.027,"No sir, I know of no reason."
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,2874.964,2876.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court."
1966.343,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2876.547,2878.283,Mr. Aksen.
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,2878.283,2879.791,Please the court.
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2924.591,2927.032,Is there an association favor.
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,2927.032,2929.952,"No sir, the arbitration--"
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2929.952,2936.148,Is your association the one that worked to get the original arbitration law for its members?
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,2936.148,2943.33,"No sir, the arbitration association was formed the year after the arbitration statute was passed."
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2950.7,2953.103,Had it not been an association before?
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,2953.103,2954.931,No sir.
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2954.931,2956.644,It was entirely new.
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,2956.644,2963.031,This was an entirely new association formed in 1926 after the enactment of the Federal Act.
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2982.763,2987.105,That was the organization (Inaudible) through the Congress.
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,2987.105,2989.274,That is correct Your Honor.
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2989.274,2995.861,It is supposed the business then and Chamber of Commerce to do business in interstate fashion.
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,2995.861,2997.506,Exactly correct.
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3042.005,3048.529,May I ask in your association what state law is set to govern in the form you provide –
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3048.529,3057.688,"The rules provide Your Honor at the moment in this case we're referring to the commercial arbitration rules, that unless the law provides for the contrary."
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3057.688,3058.916,The law provides for the contrary.
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3058.916,3063.261,"Right, that's what the rules specify, unless the law provides for the contrary."
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3083.664,3099.411,"Does it have anything to do with the provisions that appear in most of the large number of the arbitration contract, that the party agrees that the law of the state of the seller -- of the goods, shall govern?"
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3099.411,3100.601,Nothing whatsoever Your Honor.
1966.343,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3123.401,3145.632,"Referring to contract made in the state of New York by New York business who sell goods to people in districts, states and provide in the contrary that the arbitration governed by the laws of New York and be held at such place as a seller of the goods designate to try the case."
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3145.632,3149.171,This is not our preference or our clause in anyway.
1966.343,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3254.687,3260.86,"Mr. Aksen, can you enlighten us on how come they're saying for this agreement language in Section 4?"
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3260.86,3264.175,I can only recommend the alignment set forth by Judge Medina.
1966.343,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3264.175,3264.636,And that is?
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3264.636,3269.101,Who used it basically to bolster the substantive intent of the law.
1966.343,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3292.067,3318.918,"Your position is then that the Court around the country including the state courts should sanction a, fashioned law with respect to commercial arbitration without any particular legislative guidance or anything else except that the arbitration agreements are enforceable and the court should enforce them in accordance to the rule they make or what?"
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3318.918,3339.325,"Well, it's our position that the Federal Act clearly shows under Federal substantive law, what the attitude of the United States is with regard to arbitration agreements and if in fact, the Act was substantive the states will follow that, and this Court can settle the question now once and for all as it did Lincoln Mills case in 1957."
1966.343,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.325,3342.668,"So your answer is yes, you should take the same course?"
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3342.668,3347.123,"Yes, Mr. Justice White it is."
1966.343,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3373.438,3381.957,(Inaudible)
1966.343,2,24905,gerald_aksen,,3381.957,3387.396,No sir I have no figures on that.
1966.343,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3387.396,3391.984,"All right, we'll recess now."
