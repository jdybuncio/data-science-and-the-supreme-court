1967.59,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.052,"Number 59 Agnes M. Banks, etc., Petitioner versus Chicago Grain Trimmers Association Incorporation et al."
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,32.299,36.415,May it please Your Honor and Justices.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,367.69,368.621,Mr. Liebenson?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,368.621,369.145,Yes sir.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,369.145,374.852,"If you prevail do you have to cut at that $19,000 on --"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,374.852,375.911,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,377.997,386.273,"Yeah, well, I'm just, so that there's a possibility of recovery in this proceeding in excess of $19,000."
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,386.273,390.057,"Yes sir, it's about 70,000, I think in this proceeding total."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,390.057,398.018,"That -- is that, does 70 mean this is, the statute provides a computation which produces 70,000."
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,398.018,399.502,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,616.506,620.283,What you are telling us is that you could have not got hold of the copy of this report.
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,620.283,621.058,That's right sir.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.058,626.769,In their possession which you say reveled that there had been this additional incident on the 30th of January.
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,626.769,632.351,That's right sir and this widow would have no way of knowing it.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,635.819,648.098,"This Court matter in ordinary litigation and the same facts occurred, would you be able to maintain your second suit?"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,648.098,649.591,Yes sir.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,649.591,651.778,On what ground?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,651.778,659.478,Because my contention is that there are two separate causes of action and one --
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,659.478,664.792,"What are the two separate cause of action, you got cause of action here for wrongful death, haven't you?"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,664.792,665.297,"No, no"
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,665.297,666.652,In terms of litigation?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,666.652,676.822,That -- with due respect this kind of argument was submitted in the briefs in the Court of Appeals.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,700.522,702.888,And I have difficulty with that analogy?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,702.888,713.673,Well because of this reasoning; in number one instance the man had a separate cause of action going on January 26.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,713.673,715.482,What was that cause of action?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,715.482,718.803,Where he was allegedly hurt but there was no proof of it.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,718.803,722.865,"The widow here has brought an action for wrongful death, hasn't she?"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,722.865,724.229,Yes sir.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,724.229,731.014,"And she brought an action to us saying wrongful death because he was hit what by, piece of steel or something."
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,731.014,732.74,At January 26th.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,732.74,734.326,"By what, he was hit by --"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,734.326,736.078,By a piece of chain.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,736.078,737.802,"Alright, piece of chain."
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,756.366,757.484,Yes sir.
1967.59,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,757.484,773.739,And what you are saying is that those were two different cause of action and if this had been -- these had been actions brought in court of law that they would have been two different cause of actions?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,773.739,776.668,"Yes sir, because you have two separate incidents."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,788.11,798.574,"But I understand you are saying that even if you are wrong about that as applied to a lawsuit, you have a statutory provision here --"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,798.574,799.148,Yes I was going to get to that.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,799.148,807.259,"-- which permits you to do what you -- you don't have to rely on being right about in your answer to Mr. Justice Fortas, do you?"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,807.259,811.954,"No sir, but I had answer his questions."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,811.954,814.919,"Yeah, incidentally may I ask on discovery?"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,826.071,830.739,"Because of Section 22 no, no."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,945.103,949.135,Incidentally is there any copy of that form 202 in the appendix?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,949.135,950.295,No sir.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,950.295,951.475,None was filed?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,951.475,953.272,No sir.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,953.272,955.083,Well what's that supposed to say?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,955.083,958.594,Well that's supposed -- that's under the Section 30.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,967.047,970.543,"This is an obligation the statute imposes on the employer, is that it?"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,970.543,995.732,"Yes sir, within page 15 of our brief it set forth within 10 days from the date of any injury or death or from the date that the employer has knowledge of a disease or infection and so forth, he should give the name, address and business of the employer, the name, address, occupation of the employer, the cause and the nature of the injury and so forth."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1011.83,1016.845,How he finally get hold to this information that had been filed?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1016.845,1032.548,"Actually what had happened was some time afterward, the referring attorney came to me and said I heard there is a witness and we just went out and investigated and located a particular man who is not --"
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1032.548,1035.815,"And is that he say, that he had filed such a report?"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1035.815,1041.492,"Yes sir, that's how we found about it that he said, oh I gave the statement to them a long time ago."
1967.59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.977,1136.264,Would you say that if the state had provided for the trial of this kind of a claim in the ordinary courts that you would still be contending for the same rule or are you saying there is a different rule of preclusion or res judicata between the administrative determination and the courts --
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1136.264,1155.929,"No sir I'm saying that pick up, number one -- number Section 22 under -- because of Section 22 there is no res judicata and if otherwise I also say there is still isn't res judicata because they withheld the certain information that was all within their control and they didn't divulge it."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1290.154,1300.886,Does the jury finding -- is that res judicata against the employer as to happening on January 30?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1300.886,1303.098,I'd like -- that would interesting.
1967.59,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1306.065,1307.72,Your case was against the third party?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1307.72,1311.075,That was against the Norris --
1967.59,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.075,1314.632,The remedy court actually against the employer?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1314.632,1329.07,I would like to apply that as an estoppal but I actually felt that as long as -- frankly as long as the jury came in and I figured that so would the Deputy Commissioner go along and give him an award.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1329.07,1330.439,And this is what happened?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1330.439,1332.681,This is what happened sir.
1967.59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.681,1338.081,Now the Court of Appeal ever reached 33 G question?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1338.081,1343.139,"No they just stopped, they went to res judicata and stopped."
1967.59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.139,1345.931,But if they -- they assume they were wrong on that?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1345.931,1347.882,Yes sir.
1967.59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.882,1354.43,What if they were wrong with res judicata then they would have reached 33 G?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1354.43,1359.389,"Well, that would be one of the issues before them, but --"
1967.59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.389,1362.065,Are you -- do you ask us to decide that question here?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1362.065,1367.706,Yes sir and we bring it out in our brief the question we ask is whether or not a --
1967.59,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.706,1373.388,"We shouldn't, you say we shouldn't remand, assume the Court of Appeals is wrong on res judicata."
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1379.147,1385.002,Yes sir because we briefed all the other issues in the case as part of this case.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1389.053,1395.67,Is this issue of remittitur under 33 been litigated in any other case that you know?
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1395.67,1414.653,"No sir except in the case cited by counsel, there I find no other case other than one where there was a consent directed verdict by counsel, that is cited by counsel, but no other case that I could find."
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1414.653,1420.16,So the issue whether this is a compromise under the statute has not --
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1420.16,1420.741,Been decided.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1420.741,1422.176,Decided by any other court.
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1422.176,1424.114,That's right sir other than what's in the briefs.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1424.114,1427.176,"So there will be, well what in the briefs?"
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1427.176,1433.445,Well we have just a few cases and those are based on the New York case.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1433.445,1435.486,From which this statute was taken or something.
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1435.486,1437.487,Yes sir yes sir.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1437.487,1440.776,And the New York cases remitted to was not a compromise.
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1440.776,1441.89,That's right sir.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1441.89,1448.2,And you are asking that we -- that was an interpretation of the statute that Congress adopted from New York.
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1448.2,1448.555,Yes Your Honor.
1967.59,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1448.555,1451.395,And we should give the same interpretation New York Courts had given.
1967.59,0,27524,harold_a_liebenson,,1451.395,1459.033,Yes sir.
1967.59,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1459.033,1466.315,Mr. Braun.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1466.315,1472.375,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1728.644,1733.894,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1733.894,1763.254,"Section 22 and I'll get to that a little more detail Your Honor was strictly to give the Deputy Commissioner, the Administrative Agency, a vehicle by which they could exercise continuing supervision over the degree of disability and I think that the legislative history which we attempted to develop in our brief demonstrates that that is the purpose of Section 22 and the purpose is not to retry the issue of liability."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1763.254,1776.313,"I see, that's you mean if there is a finding of viability and an award of 10 percent [Inaudible]"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1776.313,1777.133,That is the purpose.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1777.133,1781.058,Will allow the [Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1781.058,1789.443,"Yes, award for the medical care or any other change in the amount of compensation as it's related to his physical condition."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1789.443,1791.387,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1791.387,1793.515,You do not.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1793.515,1798.176,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1798.176,1831.604,"The legislative history, I have cited the reports of the commission in my brief and I have not been able to find specific language in those reports, these are reports of the commission to the Congress with reference to amendments and they don't specifically say that, but when you look at the statutes of the States which preceded this Federal Statute, this was the restrictive meaning of the reopening provision."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1841.362,1845.189,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1845.189,1850.918,"No, New York, well, New York has a similar provision, it is not identical."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1850.918,1852.282,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1852.282,1856.952,But it similar in fact that it talks about a change of condition.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1861.471,1862.835,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1862.835,1866.538,"Yes, well and this is the question, what do they mean by that in this section."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1866.538,1887.984,[Inaudible] the progress of the condition.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1887.984,1890.971,"Yes, there would be a change of condition in both terms I use --"
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1890.971,1893.286,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1893.286,1894.952,"Well, this part of the question."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1897.257,1902.076,"Well, how do you meet your limitation into the word mistake?"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1902.076,1907.602,"By looking at, what I see -- well, this statute first of all started with change of condition only."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1925.437,1930.678,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1930.678,1939.685,"Yes, Your Honor, there are -- any of cases distributed with that."
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1943.031,1966.367,"Suppose a Deputy Commissioner made a finding that the deceased or claimant had not been on board to ship that day at all and then within one year, the Deputy Commissioner has reason to believe that he made a mistake and that the claimant was on ship."
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,1980.474,1982.181,I'd disagree with that.
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1998.109,2001.444,"Well, of course, getting close to this case."
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2025.372,2027.049,It is our position that he cannot.
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2027.049,2030.472,"But that's certainly it's not what the language says, is it?"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2030.472,2037.971,The language simply says he may review a determination.
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2037.971,2059.469,"Because of, he says upon his own initiatives or upon the application of any party in interest on the ground of -- no, because of a mistake in a determination of the fact by the Deputy Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner may accept or review a compensation case."
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2059.469,2060.408,That is what --
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2060.408,2072.321,"That sounds and reads is if it's very broad but you say reading, it can read mistake in a determination of fact to me what it says that's --"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2072.321,2099.826,"Only in, for the purpose of that section and this goes to the physical condition or the degree of disability and I suggest to the Court that that is the only purpose of that section because if we do not limit the purpose of Section 22 to a reexamination of the extent of the degree of disability then we have again destroyed the purpose of the whole statute to give a prompt and efficient, definite remedy."
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2123.762,2128.629,What is 919 of 33 U.S.C?
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2128.629,2135.822,919 is the Section which provides that compensation maybe awarded.
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2143.821,2172.484,"You read that, I won't probably going to the read the entire Section 22, but it does refer to reviewing a compensation case in a court with procedure prescribed in respect to claims in Section 919 of this title, then goes on to say and in accordance with such section issue a new compensation order which may terminate continue reinstate increase or decrease such compensation --"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2172.484,2173.239,"Yes, I think that --"
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2173.239,2175.291,Or award compensation.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2175.291,2176.062,That reference --
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2176.062,2180.638,So he could reopen for the purpose of awarding compensation?
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2180.638,2184.073,No question about it and I think we have to consider the nature of these --
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2184.073,2188.23,And now if you -- if you're saying no question about that then you square that with what you --
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2188.23,2198.397,"The reference to Section 19 and Section 22 is to suggest that he would use the same procedure that is the order hearing, ignorance and so forth."
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2198.397,2200.578,(Voice Overlap) Preference of awarding compensation.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2200.578,2210.613,"Yes, because in most of these cases Your Honor, not most of it, but in many cases you can have a determination of liability without an award of compensation."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2288.692,2315.417,"Well, are you telling under section 22 that the whole credit of what maybe done, is that there is already an outstanding or rather the employer has already paid compensation, whether he's paying it pursuant to award compensation or paying without an award compensation?"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2315.417,2331.815,"No, the prior payment, no Your Honor I did not say that, I say that that it may be utilized only when there has been a prior determination that an industrial injury occurred, now it doesn't have been a payment of compensation."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2331.815,2338.933,"Well what about the simply under ordinary state compensation, frequently employer is just paying --"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2338.933,2339.363,That is correct.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2339.363,2347.742,"Or actually compensation what they describe payment of statute requirement, there is no actual awards are running, is there any finding of liability [Inaudible]"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2347.742,2348.926,"That is correct, now if that --"
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2348.926,2351.643,That's how the best practice is called here.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2351.643,2352.935,Yes it is.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2356.989,2358.157,Without any award.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2358.157,2367.42,"Without any award if you have that circumstance and the employee then wants to get an award he doesn't file under 22, he files an initial claim."
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.956,2390.253,"There may be, there maybe a recent termination if there has already been, has been a determination of that liability."
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2390.253,2397.425,"This section that can be used only with reference to disability, this section I suggest doesn't apply at all to the --"
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.425,2407.317,But then you say it's not available at all there was a determination [Inaudible] that there was no compensable accident.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2407.317,2410.06,"Yes, exact determination has been made that that the --"
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.06,2411.63,It's never reviewed then.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2411.63,2416.53,"Except under Section 21, which in 30 days through the courts yes."
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.414,2434.446,And with more different hearings?
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2434.446,2437.228,"Yes, as in this case --"
1967.59,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2437.228,2440.355,Well ad infinitum within one year.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2440.355,2445.679,Well this is the thing where from the standpoint of the employee either is even a greater hardship.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2656.831,2665.009,Well how does that testify that the employer [Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2665.009,2670.884,Because at that time -- from here I will finish this one and I'll come right to that.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2684.467,2691.729,[Inaudible] your client has filed report that there had been another incident on the 30th.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2691.729,2700.151,I had a penciled memorandum from an investigator who said that one man had talked about a rope incident at that time.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2765.993,2774.858,What reward did the Deputy Commissioner have on [Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2774.858,2776.045,That man.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2776.045,2778.606,He had the eyewitness whose -- that you have.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2778.606,2782.486,Yes and he is the only witness.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2782.486,2788.833,"Did he tell a different story on the stand that he was a Deputy Commissioner, that information had given [Inaudible]"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2788.833,2791.991,"But not, not substantially no."
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.991,2796.661,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2796.661,2802.407,Well this is the point at the time of the first hearing the investigator had concluded there is absolutely nothing to this.
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.407,2808.466,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2808.466,2826.129,"Yes, he described rope-falling incident, but I would suggest to the Court with reference to that and it is outlined in more detail in the substantiality issue that even if you take mere modest testimony before the Deputy Commissioner, no member of this Court could believe that there ever was a rope-falling incident."
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.571,2863.185,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2863.185,2868.184,I don't know they did and this is part of the compromise for this reason Your Honor.
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.184,2870.279,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2870.279,2872.435,They did Your Honor and they did --
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.435,2875.381,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2875.381,2883.786,There was a resident -- for instruction in that case and I think that's why the judge in the jury case was ready to set it aside.
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.735,2892.4,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2892.4,2896.527,I think this is correct that something may have happened on that date.
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.527,2898.662,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2898.662,2909.516,"Yes then there was that jury verdict, but I would suggest that the -- certainly from the conduct of the first hearing there was no withholding."
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.128,2933.578,Well what about the obligation?
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2933.578,2934.774,On the employer.
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.774,2936.267,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2936.267,2969.617,"The obligation on the employer Your Honor is when they learn of an incident think of the time again, this man died on February 12, this statement was taken on April 8th five weeks before the trial when an application has already been filed and the only penalty is that the statute limitations has not run, but what's the penalty on the -- on an employee or a petitioner for not notifying the employer or not notifying the Deputy Commissioner, the claim is barred."
1967.59,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2988.344,2990.514,That came out of the trial.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,2990.514,2997.852,"Yes Your Honor the second trial it came out that they knew about this and withheld it, didn't mention it during the first trial."
1967.59,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2997.852,3008.392,"In view of that fact aren't we left to the question of whether this is res judicata, so that we can re-litigate that can we?"
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3008.392,3010.094,I think that is true yes Your Honor.
1967.59,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3010.094,3014.248,This is just to make way doesn't it?
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3014.248,3022.978,"Well, I talked about this because it was brought up for the reason that res judicata can apply if they were prevented from bringing it out."
1967.59,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3028.676,3031.24,Whether the question is res judicata.
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3031.24,3036.221,"Yes, there is a second full and complete question here Your Honor and that is compromise issue."
1967.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.221,3038.794,Do you think we should decided that?
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3038.794,3049.597,"I think -- well I wouldn't presume and tell what you should do, you have certainly have the right to one of the issue brought here as you do have the right to decide the substantiality issue."
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3049.597,3055.127,[Inaudible]
1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3055.127,3057.945,I don't think there is any dispute about what happened here Your Honor.

1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3060.355,3061.957,Not ordinarily no.

1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3064.525,3071.045,Yes I can make up a compensation case when you did.

1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3088.067,3094.271,"Well, this is why I suggest to the Court that it can't be hurt because it is not a complicated issue."

1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3109.501,3110.408,Yes Your Honor.

1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3112.702,3113.551,We do not.

1967.59,1,35539,mark_a_braun,,3118.9,3137.589,Of substantiality it's there yes and we suggest there that even if you believe the issue of substantiality goes to the point even if you believe that there was a rope incident there is no proof that that rope incident had anything to do with this man catapulting down the basement steps at home.
1967.59,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3198.279,3208.988,The fact that the New York courts have said that [Inaudible]
