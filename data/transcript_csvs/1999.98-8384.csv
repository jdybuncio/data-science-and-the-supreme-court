1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.327,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-8384, Terry Williams v. John Taylor."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,10.749,15.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.542,109.794,"Well, what about the seven experienced judges of the supreme court of Virginia?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,109.794,117.5,The seven experienced judges of the supreme court of Virginia committed legal error.
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,168.412,179.401,"Well, (d)(1) says, resulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,193.46,195.102,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.065,204.676,But how--
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,204.676,205.537,That's what courts do.
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.537,211.221,"--But the statute says, it has to have involved an unreasonable application."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,214.343,225.703,"Well, if unreasonable application means erroneous application in the view of five members of this Court, then the decision should not stand as a bar to habeas corpus relief."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.703,228.383,"--Well then, you say in effect that (d)(1) really did nothing."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,228.383,233.086,(d)(1) in effect codified the Teague standards.
1999.98-8384,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,233.086,245.655,"Mr. Gibbons, do you argue that in reading Strickland as modified generally by Lockhart that a legal error was made?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,245.655,246.456,"Yes, I do."
1999.98-8384,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,246.456,251.391,"Does that, then... let's assume that I agree with you there, assume for the sake of argument."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,264.739,265.881,"Yes, Justice Souter."
1999.98-8384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,297.119,301.794,"Now, suppose it chooses the right legal standard, but it misapplies it."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,307.627,318.203,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I read the clause as one whole clause dealing with legal error."
1999.98-8384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,343.962,351.875,"Well, I'm asking you, if the correct legal standard is incorrectly applied, you can say that that is contrary to law."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,351.875,352.346,Yes.
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.346,374.611,"How can you say... you might say it's contrary to law, but how can you say that it's contrary to clearly established Federal law where you have a... one Federal case, and your assertion is, you haven't applied it properly to another situation, or you've mixed up Strickland and Lockhart?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,381.707,396.025,"If you read the whole clause, Justice Scalia, it refers to contrary to clearly established law by the Supreme Court of the United States, and--"
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.025,399.979,"Ex ante, or ex post?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,406.113,406.394,--No.
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.184,437.365,But you don't have to say clearly established in order to achieve that.
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,448.464,487.998,"Well, if Congress meant that you can't decide the case because in the view of, say, one justice Strickland v. Washington didn't clearly establish something, that seems to me to put you right within City of Boerne against... whatever the name, the case where you have that RFRA was unconstitutional."
1999.98-8384,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,492.963,493.674,Mr. Gibbons--
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,493.674,494.924,--and Congress never intended that.
1999.98-8384,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.924,495.414,--Well--
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,530.207,533.809,"That is my position, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,543.216,544.566,So we get no--
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,544.566,553.003,"Now, of course, Virginia suggests that that's not what the supreme court of Virginia did, that it actually applied Strickland."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.867,580.319,--Why do you say it's a mixed question of fact and law?
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,580.319,594.837,"Well, if I'm right that Virginia simply chose the wrong governing standard, chose the rule against perpetuities instead of Strickland v. Washington, that ends the inquiry."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.837,595.979,But what if the--
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,595.979,596.75,But you'd have to go further--
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.75,605.407,"--What if the supreme court of Virginia... the supreme court of Virginia cited Strickland, and it seemed to me said the correct rule."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,610.733,619.339,"--Well, if... only if the majority of you agree that the supreme court of Virginia chose the right rule."
1999.98-8384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,636.848,645.754,"May I ask this question: isn't there a debate between the parties as to what the right rule is, whether Strickland is Strickland by itself, or Strickland as modified by Lockhart?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,645.754,659.003,"There is a debate between the parties on that, and I don't think it's much of a debate, because I don't think you can fairly read Lockhart as across-the-board modifying Strickland."
1999.98-8384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.003,664.809,"No, but if the Virginia supreme court did do that, then one could argue they applied the wrong rule."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,664.809,666.309,"Yes, and that's--"
1999.98-8384,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,666.309,666.629,Right.
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,666.629,668.302,--Let's assume they did--
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.302,672.024,Was it the supreme court of Virginia or the Fourth Circuit that relied on Lockhart?
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,672.024,676.666,--The supreme court of Virginia relied on Lockhart.
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.818,716.573,"Well, we can accept that and still say that if there is reasonable room for disagreement among judges."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,716.573,726.36,"Reasonable room for disagreement among judges with respect to a rule of law, or the application of a rule of law to undisputed facts."
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.926,769.999,"They're not telling us how to decide it, counsel, they are telling us not to decide it."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,805.696,813.551,"It means, Justice Scalia, what you said in Teague."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.18,824.39,But--
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,824.39,835.015,"New rules need not be, and the clearly established reference is simply to the old rule, new rule distinction."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.015,840.699,--But it would have been so easy for Congress to use the language of Teague if that's what it wanted to do.
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,843.213,886.85,"Well, the language chosen... reasonable application, and clearly established and so forth... you find in the Teague line of cases, and I'll grant you that this is not a model of clear statutory draftsmanship, but on the other hand, when the President looked at it, and in his signing statement interpreted it, he read it to mean what we suggest, that it did not affect the ability of this Court, or any Article III court, to decide a pure question of law or a mixed question of fact and law, all constitutional law."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.85,890.481,What deference do we give to signing statements by the President?
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,890.481,917.419,"Well, Your Honor, considering the amount of time and space that this Court has devoted to the Presentment Clause, it seems... it would seem to me to be surprising not to treat a presidential signing statement as a significant piece of legislative history."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.066,931.869,"Do any of our cases speak to that at all, one way or the other?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,931.869,939.545,"No, not... well, I take that back."
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.666,971.548,"The President gets these things after Congress has done, so I mean, that's sort of very... what if a congressional conference committee has said one thing, and then it comes to the President and he says just the opposite, I understand this statute to mean X--"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,971.548,972.048,--Well--
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.048,976.079,"--and the congressional conference committee had said, we understand it to mean Y?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,976.079,981.254,"--Well, that hypothetical, of course, is not this case, because there are no committee reports."
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.254,989.349,"Well, I understand, but it's sort of a dirty trick to come in at the end of the game and say that it means X when you know Congress thinks it's Y, which may have been the case here."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,989.349,995.704,"Well, there is no significant evidence that that was the case, and the signing--"
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.704,997.123,But we really don't know.
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,997.123,1000.595,--statement refers to the fact that some people make that contention--
1999.98-8384,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1000.595,1002.706,"Mr. Gibbons, wasn't there--"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1002.706,1003.096,"--and he said no, that's wrong."
1999.98-8384,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1003.096,1019.379,"--Mr. Gibbons, wasn't there a modification from the original language in AEDPA, that there was a standard calling for greater respect for the State court decision, and that was qualified in the final statement?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1019.379,1020.42,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-8384,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.382,1110.558,"Mr. Gibbons, they are not telling us how to decide a question of constitutional law, they are telling us not to decide particular cases."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1116.963,1126.589,"If you read this as a jurisdictional statute, you could reach that conclusion."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1165.899,1172.153,"Well, certainly Congress can limit the scope of review on habeas corpus in a way that perhaps it couldn't on direct review."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1173.555,1190.285,"If you mean, Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress can tell you to abandon your historic practice of deciding mixed questions of fact and law like plenary review, I suggest no."
1999.98-8384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.402,1201.634,Pretty strong hint.
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1201.634,1202.355,--you're wrong.
1999.98-8384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1204.816,1208.019,"Well, could Congress... could Congress--"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1208.019,1209.411,There are four things that courts do.
1999.98-8384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1209.411,1222.798,"--Could Congress make a statute codifying our successive writ jurisprudence, where you cannot bring successive writs?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1222.798,1225.271,"Yes, and--"
1999.98-8384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1225.271,1228.982,"Well, why isn't that telling us how to decide a case, under your view?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1228.982,1246.286,"--Well, for example, when Congress, or in this case a rule of court approved by Congress, tells you when a petition for certiorari is timely, Congress isn't telling you how to decide a case."
1999.98-8384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1250.609,1258.382,"Well, that's this statute in a way, because we could have taken this from State on review of the State collateral proceedings and reached the same issue."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1258.382,1288.023,"--You could have taken it on review of this... the Virginia decision, and if you had, under section 1257, at least I have no doubt that you would have reversed because Virginia misapplied the governing... chose the wrong governing precedent."
1999.98-8384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1312.098,1313.868,Could Congress get away--
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1324.617,1333.774,"Well, it has to some extent, but in this instance the issue is before you, you have jurisdiction to decide it, and you must."
1999.98-8384,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1333.774,1343.858,"Is it within the power of Congress to say that habeas relief will never be granted for an error of law alone, however clear that error may be?"
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1364.552,1377.801,"Well, if Congress added that to the present limitation on review of facts, that would be the equivalent, Justice Souter, of a repeal of habeas corpus, but that's not what Congress did."
1999.98-8384,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1377.801,1401.698,"Well, there's an argument here that when Congress uses the word decision, a decision that was contrary to clearly established law, what it was trying to get at was some kind of a, in effect a bottom-line review as distinct from a review in which a Federal court says, there was a clear error of law, habeas relief granted."
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1410.143,1413.746,"When Congress... well, there are two questions."
1999.98-8384,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1413.746,1414.257,Right.
1999.98-8384,0,30576,john_j_gibbons,,1414.257,1416.847,I'll address the last ones first.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1563.767,1567.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.98-8384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.928,1610.189,May I ask one general question about that history?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1620.213,1621.255,--Not specifically.
1999.98-8384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.255,1622.855,They didn't really focus on that.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1622.855,1638.105,Wright v. West was cited by the opponents of the reform that were suggested in this bill on the basis of Justice O'Connor's opinion that the Federal courts should be exercising independent judgment over the decisions raised in the Federal habeas petition.
1999.98-8384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1729.385,1731.488,What is your authority for that statement?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1731.488,1733.76,I do not recall the case off the top of my head.
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1767.54,1777.307,"The problem I have is that this is not usually how courts work, that this is a very different approach for the Congress to impose on this Court, is it not?"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1777.307,1785.133,"It is a different approach than Congress has chosen to impose in the past, certainly in the Federal habeas context, but it's not--"
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1785.133,1802.295,"In the Ornalis case, where we talked about mixed questions of law and fact in the probable cause for search area, we said that independent review is necessary if we are to maintain control and to clarify Federal principles."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1802.295,1819.476,"--And again, that is in the context of a direct review system, and the direct process of review between the trial, the probable cause determination, the trial, and the direct appeal, but this Court has recognized there are significant differences between the process of direct review and the process of collateral review."
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1819.476,1825.569,"Of course, competency cases usually occur on collateral review, State and Federal, do they not?"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1825.569,1848.935,"That is true, but we are now seeing in several States, as anticipated by the capital case provisions of the act, a process of unitary review, where now claims of ineffective assistance of counsel can be raised, in addition to the direct appeal claims, in one proceeding, but still, as a matter of course, most States would follow the practice of these competency claims being raised in State collateral proceedings, but still subject to this Court's review."
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.935,1855.85,"In effect, what Congress has done, is tell us, say it once, and then don't say it again, but that's not the way the law develops."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1855.85,1859.341,I'm not sure I understand the question.
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1859.341,1866.806,"Congress has said, once we announce the principle, we cannot refine it, apply it, explain it, expand it, contract it--"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1866.806,1872.69,"I don't think that's what this statute says, and I don't think that's what the proponents of the statute would have had this Court conclude."
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1895.337,1916.841,"--If I understand your argument, Mr. Harris, there could never be any determination that a State court misapplied Strickland, because on your view and the Fourth Circuit's view of what is contrary to clearly established Federal law, it must be a case that's on all fours."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1921.125,1921.685,That's correct.
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1921.685,1930.832,"The court announced a standard, so you could never have a case on all fours with Strickland that the petitioner could win, in your view of this."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1930.832,1935.775,I think that the contrary-to clause is not addressed to determining that issue.
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.809,1954.637,"Well, can you tell me if, in your view, a defendant, a petitioner for habeas corpus, Federal habeas corpus, could ever prevail on a Strickland claim given that Strickland himself did not prevail?"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1954.637,1964.044,"It would be contrary to Strickland, as the clearly established precedent of this Court, if the State court failed to recognize and apply Strickland."
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1973.19,1983.017,"Do you mean, then, that the Court would have had to say, Strickland doesn't govern, but we're not looking at Strickland, or what... I don't quite have a grasp on what you mean by--"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,1983.017,1986.508,"I think that would certainly satisfy it, if this... look back--"
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.508,2009.625,"--I think your opponent says that, if I understood the argument correctly, it doesn't matter what the Court says about Strickland, that this statute only applies to decisions contrary to Strickland, so even if you misdescribe what Strickland says, we don't really have to look to the opinion at all."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2009.625,2009.976,--I--
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.976,2010.957,We just look to the result.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2010.957,2017.171,"--I can understand that reading of the statute, and it... that certainly is implicit in focusing on the decision of the State."
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.171,2017.752,Do you agree with that reading?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2017.752,2019.365,I don't think you need to go that far in this case.
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.365,2019.966,Why?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2019.966,2020.597,You don't need to--
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.597,2022.23,It's not a matter of going that far.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2024.863,2029.325,"--Well, I think in the context of this case, the decision is the adjudication of the facts and the law of the case."
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.504,2046.57,"--What if it said something clearly contrary to Strickland, but the result... it might have been contrary to Strickland, might not have been contrary."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2056.42,2061.885,"--I cannot object to that rule, but I'm not sure that that's what Congress had in mind."
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.154,2096.726,"You would say that if the State court did not use Strickland, or misdescribed Strickland, that their decision would be covered by this provision, we could reverse them on habeas, even though the result, if you applied Strickland correctly, might have been missed or might not have."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2096.726,2099.569,"I understand that reading, but I'm not certain the Court needs to go to that point."
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2100.37,2102.911,Let's assume the Court does think it has to go that far.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2106.012,2107.654,--The strict reading of the statute is correct.
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2107.654,2107.844,--grant relief or not?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2108.605,2110.688,"The strict reading of the statute, Justice Scalia, is certainly correct."
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2119.644,2126.44,"--So on his hypothetical, on which the law is clearly wrong, the decision may or may not be right, we're not sure, no relief?"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2126.44,2128.533,--As a practical--
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2128.533,2128.904,That's your position?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2128.904,2132.025,"--As a practical matter, that will be the result, but because--"
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2132.025,2134.778,"Well, I want to know what your position is in answer to the legal question."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2138.19,2142.394,"--If the decision is not contrary, or an unreasonable application, no relief."
1999.98-8384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.394,2152.98,"Well, if you take that position, you leave the court, this Court and perhaps other Federal courts, to have to analyze intensively the facts of each case."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2177.025,2206.076,"Again, I don't think the Court needs to go as far as to reach Justice Scalia's question in this case, and again, as a practical result, if the State court decision affirmatively gives the Federal reviewing court reason to doubt seriously whether or not the State court correctly applied the correct law, or unreasonably applied the correct law, what the Court in effect is doing is a de novo review at that point, and trying... and that... you get to the same point as you would under 2254(d)'s contrary-to."
1999.98-8384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.548,2214.631,It seems to me this is kind of an unlikely hypothetical.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2244.671,2246.391,--I would agree the Fourth Circuit--
1999.98-8384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.391,2249.954,So is there ever a chance... this kind of goes back to Justice Ginsburg's case.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2258.309,2262.811,--That has not been this Court's treatment of the objectionable reasonableness component of Teague.
1999.98-8384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.045,2267.025,"No, but that's the Fourth Circuit's treatment of it, I think."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2267.025,2276.861,--The Fourth Circuit is identifying the precisely identical standard that was applied by this Court in Teague as far as objective reasonableness of a State court decision.
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2282.665,2302.288,"But Mr. Harris, the Fourth Circuit said it means reasonable jurists would all agree that the interpretation was unreasonable, so to apply that to this case you would have to say that the jurists on the Virginia supreme court were not reasonable."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2310.233,2318.997,"I think that is the same way of stating the Teague analysis of objective reasonableness, whether reasonable jurists can disagree, and as this Court made--"
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2318.997,2322.46,But reasonable jurists always disagree.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2337.821,2345.446,"--Well, I think that this Court's understanding of objective reasonableness through the Teague cases is not focusing on the particular jurists involved."
1999.98-8384,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2353.272,2379.191,"I began to think, after reading 11 briefs on this, that if we take this statute, which is clearly a compromise, and interpret it literally, we're going to have a system that's so complicated that virtually no trial judge is going to be able to administer it, and few appellate judges, so I wondered what you'd think of reading this statute as legislating a mood, rather like Universal Camera and the APA."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2403.716,2420.658,"I think Congress has taken an additional step beyond that, Justice Souter, by... that... your suggestion that there may be highly unusual particular cases outside the contrary-to, I would suggest that it's the unreasonable applications here that is going to provide the gist of the work for the Federal courts."
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2440.511,2443.553,Suppose the unreasonable application clause were not in the statute.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2456.902,2470.122,"Under my understanding of 2254(d), it looks like you're describing basically a Teague issue, where you're simply looking at the State court's choice of the legal rule that's going to control a claim."
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2470.122,2472.643,"The legal rule is right, they just got it wrong."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2477.648,2478.336,"Well, again--"
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2478.336,2480.738,"If the statute just had the phrase, contrary to law--"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2480.738,2487.203,"--If they got the legal rule wrong, what this statute allows is, the exception is met--"
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2487.203,2491.568,"--Let's say they get the legal rule right, a close case, we think they're wrong."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2495.36,2496.099,--Without--
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2496.099,2503.385,"And if just contrary-to is the operative phrase, and involved and unreasonable application is not in the statute at all, what result?"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2503.385,2513.413,"--Without the addition of unreasonable application, I think this Court would be left and Federal courts would be left with the authority to disagree with the application of the--"
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.413,2534.814,"Well, that depends on how literally you take the word decision, and I thought you were... you said earlier you were going to take decision quite literally, because the decision would be contrary to clearly established Federal law, if you apply the clearly established law incorrectly to the facts, so maybe you don't think decision really means decision."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2534.814,2538.067,--Decision clearly does mean decision.
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.067,2549.254,"Well then, it seems to me saying contrary-to would have been enough, because every decision involves applying the law to the facts."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2552.286,2560.193,"I think what we need to keep in mind is that Congress has given us both, because Congress intended both to have an operative effect in this statute."
1999.98-8384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.205,2617.962,"Well, that's not quite correct, because Teague prior to the statute was just a judge-made rule, and conceivably Congress might have wanted to include that in statutory law."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2617.962,2624.267,And I think clearly Congress has brought in what Teague would have given as a judge-made rule.
1999.98-8384,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.529,2631.402,So the statute is not a nullity even if you read it as just codifying Teague.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2631.402,2638.425,"--Well, Congress said they were reforming existing law, and it's a nullity in that sense, if you say it does no more than codify existing law."
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2675.3,2677.942,"Mr. Harris, may I ask you one question on that point."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2717.577,2726.121,"--Well, to the last point of that question, what the trial judge said in this case was to define reasonable probability in a way that is simply incorrect."
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2726.802,2726.902,Why?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2726.902,2733.387,"--Well, the trial judge said, in a capital case mitigating evidence is important, and if it's not offered, it is prejudice."
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2741.174,2742.713,I didn't see that in his opinion.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2755.382,2762.755,--Looking in the appendix at page 424--
1999.98-8384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2762.755,2763.846,Page what?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2763.846,2764.998,--424.
1999.98-8384,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2797.97,2806.776,"Well, of course, that was in a context when this defense counsel came up with no specific arguments on his behalf."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2825.187,2834.372,"Well, if I could look back, then, at those particular facts, what trial counsel did in this case is what this Court has recognized in Strickland and in Berger v. Kemp as what counsel do."
1999.98-8384,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2849.313,2857.517,"Mr. Harris, I thought we were to assume that there was... it was incompetent not to present this testimony, and the only question was prejudice."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2857.517,2866.585,"--Well, even if we assume that, then, the question is whether or not what he has shown is prejudicial to the... under the Strickland standard, I would say that the Virginia supreme court got it right."
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2921.27,2931.365,"Wasn't there a reference to the testimony that could have been brought in about the horrendous conditions in which Williams was brought up, and none of that was presented, I take it."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2931.365,2942.324,"The trial court made a reference to documents where trial counsel could have investigated those documents to determine if reasonable... to determine if reasonable... not reasonable, determine if mitigating evidence could be developed."
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2942.324,2944.275,Is it assumed--
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2944.275,2944.796,It's a given.
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2944.796,2948.378,--Is it assumed for the sake of argument that there was such mitigating evidence?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2948.378,2951.951,"It is assumed for the sake of this case, but records--"
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2951.951,2952.121,Okay.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,2994.977,3006.387,"--The courts... the Virginia supreme court and the Fourth Circuit reviewing this case... and, of course, the Fourth Circuit also agreed as a de novo decision in this case that he had not met the Strickland standard of prejudice."
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3006.387,3028.962,"Well, I know that's what they concluded, but I'm giving you a specific example of what would in fact be admissible mitigating evidence under the law as it is now, and I'm saying, isn't it reasonable to suppose that one juror could have heard that evidence and said, I'm not going to execute for that purpose, and if the answer is yes, isn't that a sufficient showing of Strickland prejudice?"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3028.962,3030.392,The answer to that is no.
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3030.392,3030.792,Why?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3030.792,3034.225,Strickland is not a standard that focuses on the views of one juror.
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3034.225,3038.538,"Well, I... that... I guess that gets us to the issue implicit in my question."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3084.718,3094.956,"Justice Souter, as I'm sure the Court is aware, you have never indicated that the Strickland standard is to address the hypothetical views of a single juror on a jury."
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.537,3110.416,"Mr. Harris, if we went that far, why shouldn't we go even a little further and acknowledge the reasonable probability that one of the 12 jurors is unreasonable?"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3110.416,3114.137,"--Well, again, the Strickland itself I think is designed--"
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3114.137,3128.977,"So that if you could sow that you had one of the 12, and maybe bring in evidence to show that one of the 12 was a bleeding heart and had an abused childhood himself or herself and would have given enormous undue weight to this... which you're allowed to."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3136.614,3136.732,--I--

1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3140.325,3140.875,--I--
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.875,3142.616,Do you want to talk about reasonable mercy?
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3142.616,3145.751,--I'm not trying to put this in terms of a reasonable mitigation.
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3157.658,3169.727,"We are making the assumption that the jurors are reasonable, and we are asking how a particular kind of mitigating evidence, admissible mitigating evidence could affect a reasonable juror."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3169.727,3172.709,"--Well, I think that Strickland's asking how it affects a reasonable jury."
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3172.709,3208.152,"And if you say, well, we're going to translate that into a scheme that demands unanimity of reasonableness, as Justice Ginsburg said a moment ago with respect to judges, reasonable judges are disagreeing all the time, and if you translate this into a hypothetical unanimity of 12 people in responding to a particular piece of evidence, as opposed simply looking to the question of what a reasonable juror might reasonably have done, it seems to me you're reading the practicality of the standard right out of the law."
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3208.152,3221.448,"Justice Souter, if we're talking about a reasonable juror in the sense of 12 reasonable jurors, all of whom are looking at this case conscientiously, impartially, and faithfully applying the law, then it's no difference looking at one as it is looking at 12."
1999.98-8384,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.448,3224.562,"Reasonably merciful jurors is what you're saying, right?"
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3224.562,3225.512,"No, I'm not saying that at all."
1999.98-8384,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3232.116,3232.476,Right.
1999.98-8384,1,39532,robert_q_harris,,3275.947,3285.324,"--I think it is in... Strickland speaks in terms of the jury reaching a decision on the issue of guilt or innocence, or sentence."

1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3354.976,3362.152,May it please the Court:
1999.98-8384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.682,3393.216,Whereabouts on the--
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3393.216,3395.156,--the Virginia trial court erred.
1999.98-8384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3395.937,3397.97,"--Whereabouts on the page are you reading from, Mr. Gibbons?"
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3397.97,3399.57,444.
1999.98-8384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3399.57,3401.052,444?
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3401.052,3403.313,"Yes, the end of the opinion."
1999.98-8384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3421.025,3429.009,"Well, in the penultimate paragraph starting, in conclusion, the court simply is quoting from language in Strickland."
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3429.009,3442.509,But the previous paragraph makes it perfectly clear that the error that it identified was the trial court's error in using the Strickland test.
1999.98-8384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3450.054,3466.074,"Well, turning back to 443, the beginning of the paragraph that you're referring to, the first sentence is... this is the supreme court of Virginia... unfortunately, the circuit court appears to have adopted a per se approach to the prejudice element."
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3475.251,3497.096,"Well, if you read that in the context of the trial court's decision, yes, it's wrong, because what the trial court looked at was the fact that the Virginia legislature had opted for a scheme in which the jury must be unanimous before it can impose death."
1999.98-8384,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3515.298,3518.921,"I read that differently, Judge Gibbons."
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3538.234,3542.067,"That's exactly what the Virginia court held, and that's legal error."
1999.98-8384,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3544.028,3545.488,I don't understand.
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3570.275,3570.716,"--No, that would be Fretwell."
1999.98-8384,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3571.835,3573.527,The outcome would be different.
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3576.789,3576.99,--No--
1999.98-8384,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.99,3582.235,--Outcome different as a result of the failure of adequate performance by counsel.
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3582.235,3593.441,--Failure of adequate performance by counsel in investigating and presenting something that the petitioner was legally entitled to--
1999.98-8384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3593.441,3594.293,"Thank you, Mr.--"
1999.98-8384,2,30576,john_j_gibbons,,3594.293,3595.293,--not something the petition--
1999.98-8384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3595.293,3596.376,"--I think you've answered the question, Mr. Gibbons."
