1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.219,"We'll hear arguments next in number 72-630, Hall against Cole."
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,19.725,23.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,403.645,409.104,What about the period between the time of his termination and time of the district court judgment?
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,409.104,410.75,"Everything he overwrites, Your Honor."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,410.75,411.782,I mean he was a --
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,411.782,414.692,"He was accorded every single right, and that's the court --"
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,414.692,418.295,Not good at back payments.
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,418.295,419.176,I don't understand.
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,419.176,422.794,I am trying to say he has been receiving a pension.
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,422.794,429.256,"He retired in 1967, and since 67 to date, he has been receiving a pension."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,430.983,435.73,"He would not have received that absent that district court judgment, is that correct?"
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,435.73,437.156,"No, he would have received in anyway."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,437.156,438.118,He would have received it any event?
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,438.118,440.101,"Yes, in any event he would have received it."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,448.202,451.429,"What do you say, the court's relief consisted of?"
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,451.429,456.526,The courts relief -- the court went on to make – if I say some very significant findings.
1972.72-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.714,534.918,This is the District Court --
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,534.918,538.557,"This is District Court Mr. Justice Rehnquist, yes."
1972.72-630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.729,564.789,"And I expect also pointing out that general provision, such relief is maybe appropriate sometimes."
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,564.789,566.058,He didn't say that.
1972.72-630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,566.058,567.091,"Oh, not the district court."
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,567.091,567.866,Not the district court.
1972.72-630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,567.866,569.026,That was the Court of Appeals.
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,569.026,576.334,"Court of Appeals fundamentally affirmed and said, as maybe appropriate, as you just said Mr. Justice Brennan."
1972.72-630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,842.356,846.331,"Mr. Schulman, did the Senator carry his argument to the Senate?"
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,846.331,848.159,"No, he did not carry it to the Senate."
1972.72-630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,848.159,849.395,Which was his own House?
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,849.395,850.262,Which was his own House.
1972.72-630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,851.1,854.869,Is there anything indicative in that part?
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,854.869,877.609,"No, there is -- I think the manner in which the debate occurred brought this about, because the Kuchel Amendment to 102 did not come out of a committee, it came right up on the floor over this problem of bureaucratic chaos, and we haven't enable to ascertain any discussion on the Senate side, relative to providing for attorney’s fees."
1972.72-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.373,924.741,Reduced by the House or--?
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,924.741,929.761,"The House Bill then contained four months, and then committee accept it as four months."
1972.72-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,929.761,934.099,Well you think Senator Goldwater’s vision perhaps was the fight having been lost in the Senate.
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,938.472,940.554,I think it was a combination of both Mr. Justice.
1972.72-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.229,984.424,So he is trying in fact to get the House to do something that the Senate was unwilling to do?
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,984.424,986.054,That's correct.
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,987.539,1017.634,"I got some impression Mr. Schulman of this record, and you perhaps can clarify it for me, that the legislative history suggests that one of the reasons why they did not affirmatively provide before attorney’s fees is that there were some thought that the statute without that explicit provision was broad enough to give a very broad relief."
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1017.634,1018.728,I would direct myself Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1018.728,1020.471,If you would.
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1022.316,1033.842,There is nothing at all by any contender of this Bill saying that broad language will encompass attorney’s fees.
1972.72-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.325,1131.283,"There had been an earlier draft in the House that specifically provided for attorney’s fees, but it failed and the Bill that came out of the House didn't --"
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1131.283,1132.917,That is not so Mr. Justice.
1972.72-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.635,1149.376,"Well, was there a difference between the Elliott draft and the ultimate Landrum-Griffin Bill?"
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1149.376,1153.379,"No, both accepted in substance the Kuchel Amendment."
1972.72-630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.379,1154.864,And neither dealt with attorney's fees?
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1154.864,1162.622,"And neither dealt with attorney’s fees, that is correct Mr. Justice, but there are equally significant issues in this matter."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1340.564,1341.776,If I may interrupt you again Mr. Schulman --
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1341.776,1342.875,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1342.875,1346.761,I think I have put my finger on what had raised this subject in my mind.
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1372.891,1381.631,"That language referred to, but at no time was there any mention at all with respect to attorney’s fees, and it rose within a context."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1381.631,1390.137,But wasn't that a response to a suggestion or in the general context of the debate about the inadequacies of the Bill?
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1390.137,1404.049,"No, it would appear to me that if I would make an objection that there are not provisions for attorney’s fees, and if that was intended as a reply, certainly the inference would be, “This has broad enough to cover everything including attorney’s fees."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1411.207,1421.109,"His views -- if any of these views carry any weight, his views would be of more utility than the views of the --"
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1421.109,1421.474,Sponsors.
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1421.474,1423.919,"-- people who were protesting, would they not?"
1972.72-630,0,28060,howard_schulman,,1423.919,1427.645,"No, because his Bill was never adopted."
1972.72-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.59,1626.665,Mr. Hall.
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,1626.665,1630.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.72-630,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1928.215,1932.851,Was Cole a -- he was not himself a Union officer or agent.
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,1933.676,1935.244,"He was rank and file member, that's right, Your Honor."
1972.72-630,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1935.244,1936.992,And employed as a seaman?
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,1936.992,1939.477,That's right.
1972.72-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2024.079,2025.042,Could you raise your voice a little Mr. Hall?
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2025.042,2028.358,"Oh, I am sorry, Your Honor."
1972.72-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.406,2115.855,And what was the source of the cause of action in the Mill’s case?
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2115.855,2119.949,I believe it was a suit to challenge a merger on the ground that the --
1972.72-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2119.949,2121.558,Equity action or --?
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2121.558,2122.453,I believe it was a --
1972.72-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2122.453,2124.606,Or was it statute?
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2124.606,2137.065,"It rose under the Security’s Exchange Act, under a guarantee of non misleading statements to be sent out in shareholder’s votes."
1972.72-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.065,2147.086,"But it wasn't part of the structured statutory scheme, or was it that it was provided for stockholder suits, and stockholder claims, and remedies?"
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2147.086,2154.293,"The statute did provide for suit in other Sections, and it provided specifically for attorney’s fees in other Sections."
1972.72-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.695,2182.749,"And wasn't that one of the reasons the court used to distinguish Mills from Fleischmann, where they have held attorney’s fees weren't permissible, was that in Fleischmann the statute had provided a private remedy, whereas in Mills, the Court had to imply the private remedy, and therefore was free to also imply attendant attributes of the remedy?"
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2182.749,2190.843,"I believe there are two distinctions, and were two distinctions in the Fleischmann case when they discussed -- they didn't request, Fleischmann did not discuss Mills."
1972.72-630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.179,2309.361,"Well, unless you take Mills where it didn't specify any private right at all, I mean, isn't -- this is really somewhere between Mills and Fleischmann, isn't it?"
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2309.361,2321.518,Somewhere in that sentence; I believe the Section -- and I don't have the Section as I see that clearly in my mind to answer very specifically.
1972.72-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2364.275,2369.264,Do you have any comment about Section 501(b) specific provision?
1972.72-630,1,17695,burton_h_hall,,2369.264,2389.46,"501(b) is a suit involving fiduciary -- it is a Section involving the -- no, 501(a) imposes a fiduciary duty on officials and 501(b) is a suit obtained for the benefit of the Union, relief for breach of the fiduciary duty."
1972.72-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2878.263,2879.08,Thank you Mr. Hall.
1972.72-630,2,28060,howard_schulman,,2880.517,2884.306,Just a few comments.
1972.72-630,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.405,2983.114,Thank you gentleman.
