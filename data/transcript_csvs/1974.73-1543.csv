1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.297,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1543, Johnson against Railway Express Agency."
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,74.579,77.333,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,481.182,488.873,Are you going to tell us a little bit about what administrative remedies were available if any under the Railway Act?
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,490.679,491.559,"No, Your Honor, that --"
1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,491.559,498.276,"I take the position that isn't the real, genuine meaning for remedy?"
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,498.276,504.253,We would take the position that there are independent remedies under Section 1981 and Title VII.
1974.73-1543,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,795.551,812.547,"Mrs. Greenberg, are you in any way restricting your application of your theory that is -- should the tolling effect for instance be limited to the charges raised in the EEOC complaint or should it be wide open?"
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,812.547,824.572,I think the tolling effect should be limited to the same extent that they would be limited in a Title VII case.
1974.73-1543,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,839.293,854.559,"Would it have been possible for Mr. Johnson to have filed his 1981 action before the period of limitation expired and then just kind of sit on it, he'd have to have the approval of court I suppose."
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,854.559,862.568,"Yes, that would have been possible but we've seen no reason for bargaining the court calendars with cases which are going to be sat on."
1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,862.568,876.388,"What if it takes as it does with some of the agencies Mrs. Greenberg, I won't mention any particular agency but some of them take four or five years or more."
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,878.248,879.958,This is a problem.
1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,915.014,925.089,We'll resume there right after lunch.
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,929.187,933.278,Yes.
1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,991.451,1000.466,"Now, are you arguing that the commencement of the first action itself told the statute?"
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1000.466,1004.179,Yes.
1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1007.444,1009.753,That question -- is that question here?
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1012.642,1017.367,That question is not here.
1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1028.242,1037.032,If you are arguing to sustain the judgment of the court you could use any argument you wanted probably or almost any argument.
1974.73-1543,0,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,1038.623,1064.672,"Oh, we could further argue that even if the commencement of the first action did not toll but running of the statute on the time for filing that action, that the second action was brought within a year after dismissal of the first action as allowed by the Tennessee saving statute which provides for bringing -- in the case of any action dismissed without a determination on the merits."
1974.73-1543,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1229.643,1233.544,Very well.
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,1235.598,1239.076,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.876,1389.121,I suppose that the acceptable matter is -- you could say that the statute would have to be satisfied within the time of the Title VII suit?
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,1389.121,1393.809,"Well, that is one alternative that may be open to this Court."
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.147,1409.694,(Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,1409.694,1411.182,That is correct.
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.926,1434.236,"Are you saying that even if -- even if your opponents are riding on the initial tolling -- they are really are cutout by the fact of Title VII suit, it can't be filed?"
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,1434.236,1439.373,That is correct Your Honor and I believe this Court has two courses open to it.
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.309,1458.717,"Do you say our limitation, (Inaudible) do you think was -- you almost decided it?"
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,1458.717,1461.817,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1974.73-1543,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2046.538,2062.723,Do you know of anything that would have prevented the Congress from providing that -- and actions could be brought within six months to one-year or some fixed period after some described cutoff point in the EEOC proceeding?
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2062.723,2069.888,That is in effect of what they did as far as the EEOC cases are concerned under Title VII.
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.822,2137.338,But you don't even get to that question --
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2137.338,2137.775,No you don't.
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.775,2142.089,"(Voice Overlap) if you're incorrect, the first suit was affirmative--"
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2142.089,2143.247,That's correct.
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.785,2157.076,"If -- but if you're wrong, if you're wrong on that and the first suit was filed at the time, wouldn't you say that the -- while that suit was pending, the statute was tolled?"
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2157.076,2165.287,"Except for the fact that it became the law of the case, that further proceedings --"
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.287,2175.716,"Let's assume that the first case was still pending and had never been decided yet, is that your (Inaudible)?"
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2175.716,2179.113,"Your Honor, I respectfully submit that the court's --"
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.113,2184.8,"No, no, expire and the suit become barred on it pending?"
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2184.8,2208.774,That may be Your Honor except I wish to draw the court's attention to the fact that the court in the first suit did specify a period of time in which further action should be brought and there was no appeal from that as the Court of Appeals pointed out at 107(a) of the record and that that was a final decision so that that would seem to be res judicata on the issue.
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.774,2209.646,That's another point.
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2209.646,2211.296,"Yes, it is."
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.296,2216.476,"And while it was pending, that statute was tolled."
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2216.476,2218.305,I think that one could infer that.
1974.73-1543,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.305,2219.668,It (Voice Overlap) in the first suit.
1974.73-1543,1,17200,arthur_m_wisehart,,2219.668,2221.115,Yes.
1974.73-1543,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2362.963,2364.727,Mr. Highsaw.
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2364.727,2368.905,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.416,2693.789,"So, I take it that a -- the 1981 action is separate and apart from the E -- from the Title VII suit that might eventuate?"
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2693.789,2697.761,"No, that's an alternative basis for jurisdiction, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2698.413,2707.677,I take it that the 1981 action will either be completely distinct or overlapped the Title VII suit.
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2707.677,2711.924,"Well, I have never seen a case that it wasn't just the same facts."
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2711.924,2717.78,That's what I -- what difference does it make it whether the 1981 action survives at all?
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2717.78,2717.966,Well --
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2717.966,2722.293,If the Title VII suit maybe broad within time?
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2722.293,2731.661,"Well, it requires the -- that requires the defendants among other things to be litigating."
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2734.071,2734.84,"Oh, I understand but (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2734.84,2736.241,"Yeah, yeah, in this --"
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2736.241,2745.253,"Let's assume that the -- that suit is timely brought and it says, there's two counts, one is the Title VII suit and one is the 1981 suit."
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2753.617,2762.375,It can reach other matters but usually it does not but it was -- does provide other remedies which can make a substantial --
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2762.375,2762.869,What's that?
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2763.679,2765.842,"-- substantial difference to a defendant, complete --"
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2765.842,2766.968,"Oh, that's what I want to know."
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2773.137,2777.291,"Well, punitive damages is one area, one very major area --"
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2777.291,2777.825,Punitive damages.
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2777.825,2781.191,Now that you feel threatened in.
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2807.099,2807.98,In some state?
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2807.98,2810.899,"In some states, yes."
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2827.311,2836.032,The filing of the EEOC complaint at least puts on notice that there may be eventually a Title VII suit.
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2836.032,2836.71,But there's another --
1974.73-1543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2836.71,2842.794,And it also use -- it said that what very frequently involved facts that could give 1981 relief.
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2842.794,2843.741,No.
1974.73-1543,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.854,2907.096,"Now you represent a union with quite a large membership, I take it."
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2907.096,2921.66,"Well, the union that these two local largest are in is -- that's right, it's a railroad union that has about 200,000 members, these two local largest at that time probably had maybe 75 members."
1974.73-1543,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2921.66,2939.019,"I don't know that its relevant here, but I wonder if you know any idea how many notices a year, how many complaints a year were filed with EEOC affecting people who were your members or are your members?"
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2939.019,2939.057,Well --
1974.73-1543,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2939.057,2940.848,Is it a very large number or very small number?
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2940.848,2944.214,It's a very large number.
1974.73-1543,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2980.431,2984.385,And I suppose this was something fairly common to any new mechanism of this kind.
1974.73-1543,2,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,2984.385,2988.306,"I think that's right, that's right."
1974.73-1543,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2988.306,2992.029,Thank you Mr. Highsaw.
1974.73-1543,3,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3003.776,3020.11,"In response to REA's contention that under the regulations, the petitioner's charge might still be pending before the EEOC and therefore this -- there would be tolling forever."
1974.73-1543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3078.51,3088.773,And do you think that it should be tolled during the time the compliant is pending and up until the time the right to sue letter is issued.
1974.73-1543,3,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3088.773,3089.184,Yes.
1974.73-1543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.184,3091.563,And then the state statute starts running with you.
1974.73-1543,3,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3091.563,3092.705,Yes.
1974.73-1543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.705,3094.472,"And the time begins when, not with the complaint --"
1974.73-1543,3,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3094.472,3094.846,With the timing --
1974.73-1543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.846,3096.652,"-- with the timing of a charge with the commission, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1543,3,20910,deborah_m_greenberg,,3096.652,3097.615,Yes.
