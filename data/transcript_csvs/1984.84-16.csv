1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.42,We will hear arguments next in Cory against Western Oil and Gas.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,78.766,82.654,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,170.443,185.936,Do you think the result would have been the same under the reasoning of the Court of Appeals if the measurement had not been related to traveling over California territory but simply a percentage of the volume of material taken out?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,185.936,193.791,"Well, of course, Your Honor, this is one fact that we would like to drive home to the maximum extent possible."
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,258.734,266.221,"May I ask, Mr. Eagan, is the rent calculated on the basis of volume of oil, is that it, in transit?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,266.221,271.208,"Well, another point, Your Honor, it is not limited to oil."
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,272.192,273.792,"Or whatever goods, generally yes."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,273.792,279.179,"In this case, given the Plaintiffs, we are talking about oil and petroleum products."
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,287.452,292.004,"Well, you didn't expressly mention the export/import clause, did you?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,292.004,293.105,"--Yes, I did, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,298.473,305.829,"Well, the considerations would be different whether that clause was violated from the consideration of if the commerce clause is violated."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,305.829,307.781,"--Well, certainly the import/export clause is different."
1984.84-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.368,379.961,"Mr. Eagan, would the situation be any different if the State of California either owned or controlled every parcel of land through which the products could enter to go to the refineries?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,379.961,383.179,"If, indeed, there was a monopoly."
1984.84-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.199,430.276,What percentage of this product annually coming into California passes through sources other than state land or does the record tell us?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,430.276,431.561,"--Well, it is not in the record, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,456.776,465.282,"Mr. Eagan, can I ask kind of a basic question here which is whether we should look at this as a tax case or property private rental case?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,473.655,475.088,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.722,504.007,"But here it pays a lot more than its own way, doesn't it?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,504.007,504.824,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,514.113,515.398,"Yes, and the Court of Appeals."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,515.398,516.798,Excuse me?
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.798,518.1,And the Court of Appeals.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,518.1,527.64,"Well, the Court of Appeals realized that really the issue was the form or mode of rent rather than amounts."
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.031,624.452,"In your view, does the Constitution oppose any limit on the amount you can charge even if you regard this rent?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,624.452,636.242,"--If the market participant clause is indeed applicable, Your Honor, no, the Constitution does not provide any limits."
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,640.079,642.013,Either form or amount?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,642.013,642.931,Excuse me?
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.931,647.9,"It would not pose any limit as to either form or amount, method of computation or amount."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,647.9,648.55,That is correct.
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.55,649.835,If you went on market participant.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,677.252,680.204,"There are a number of alternative responses to it, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,724.717,745.731,"Well, of course, what if the State of California owned all of the... owned a half-mile strip all the way around the coastline and all the way around the eastern border of state and northern border and southern border and said, you know, everybody that is bringing any goods in here, we are going to have to charge them a little rent to cross this land?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,754.586,764.294,"Well, the example used... It is hard to conceive a mere transit use being something that could generate a rent."
1984.84-16,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.448,800.4,What sort of scrutiny would be imposed--
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,800.4,813.977,"This Court very well might be reluctant to get into that thicket, because in the tax field it occasionally has demonstrated some reticence about getting into numbers, calculations."
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,861.874,870.73,"--Mr. Eagan, supposed a state owned a lot of land and part of it is cut up by a deep canyon and they built a bridge across that canyon."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,877.634,880.002,Well--
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,880.002,885.303,"No navigable stream involved, just a dry, great big dry hole."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,885.303,889.357,"--Well, one, they would be entitled to charge something for it, no question."
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.849,905.634,"Suppose they charged on the basis of tonnage, weight?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,905.634,908.086,That is not uncommon.
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,912.973,925.364,"You might charge an automobile that weighed about two tons at most, you charge one fee, but if a great big truck is going to cross that weighs 20 tons, you charge him a good deal more."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,928.114,936.57,"--Well, let's assume that we have analyzed the market participants... or at least the availability of other practical alternatives and the Court has found there are none."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.799,969.374,"Yes, but the Chief Justice's question was couldn't the state charge based on the amount of tonnage, in short, a charge commensurate to how the bridge was used?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,969.374,971.493,"Yes, Your Honor, I think they could."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.493,972.928,"There wouldn't be any problem about that, would there?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,972.928,973.461,I--
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.461,981.867,"But, that isn't in this case, is it, because it doesn't make any difference about wear and tear on the state's property, how much volume is carried."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,981.867,984.653,"--Well, there is volume, of course, depending on--"
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.653,995.858,"Yes, there is, but the state's property that is used in this case isn't going to deteriorate because twice as much volume is in one year than in another."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,995.858,997.876,"--Your Honor, that is true of any ground lease."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.876,998.476,Well--
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,998.476,999.662,"And, if you--"
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.662,1002.697,"--So it is true of this one, right?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1002.697,1005.732,--It is certainly true of this ground lease.
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1025.611,1034.066,"Mr. Eagan, do you recognize any constraints on rent by reason of the import/export clause?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1034.066,1042.072,"Not by reason of the import/export clause, no, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1042.072,1042.589,None at all?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1042.589,1049.428,It just is not applicable to rent if we are dealing in fact with a ground lease and indisputably that is what we are dealing with here.
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1049.428,1064.605,"Of course, that clause and the tonnage clause both were intended, weren't they, to prevent coastal states like California from exploiting their geographic positions at the expense of sister states, do they not?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1064.605,1068.889,"But, the corollary... It is true enough, Your Honor, but the corollary--"
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1068.889,1079.28,Yet you say there is no concern at all in measuring a propriety of the rent with that consideration?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1079.28,1091.088,--This concern of the framers of the Constitution finds expression in a number of clauses and three of them probably central are the commerce clause and the import/export clause.
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1100.444,1101.244,"Well, let me put it this way."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1107.531,1110.566,The analysis proceeds independently.
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.879,1134.265,"Well, do you think you could just refuse to lease at all?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1134.265,1135.867,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.069,1143.787,And whether it is commerce or import/export clause considerations.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1146.323,1150.543,"--There might be health and safety concerns, really governmental concerns that they want to lease--"
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.543,1153.428,--Just like off-shore oil drilling.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1153.428,1156.863,--I am not saying--
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.863,1159.065,"Which wouldn't be fencible, would it?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1159.065,1163.6,"--That is not in my section, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.6,1164.1,Yes.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1164.784,1174.592,"If there is a monopoly, which there clearly is not here, but if there were a monopoly, indeed, you may get into motivation."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.825,1204.094,How does the oil company use the state property?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1204.094,1209.296,"--Well, the prime example and obvious example would be Standard Oil's Longworth in Richmond."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.35,1251.491,"Well, does the property or leasing deteriorate from year to year because of the use that you permit the oil company to put it to?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1251.491,1254.277,"I don't think you can make that generalization, no, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.277,1256.027,"So, it is not like a highway, for instance?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1256.027,1257.06,"No, this is a ground lease."
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1265.633,1267.751,Who provides the police and fire protection?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1267.751,1275.357,"--Well, that particular example, probably the City of Richmond, California."
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1275.357,1276.873,It is public at any rate?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1276.873,1277.64,The public.
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1284.546,1292.2,Does the Commission take the position that it may charge any rent that is applicable there?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1292.2,1293.568,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1293.568,1296.77,What limits does it recognize?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1296.77,1304.258,"Well, again, it wants to lease its property, at least if it has a piece of ground that it thinks is appropriate for that use."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.123,1334.229,"But, what about... Do you think there are any federal constitutional limitations on the amount of the rent that the state may charge?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1334.229,1337.931,In a monopoly--
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1337.931,1338.714,Any at all.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1341.149,1342.583,--On the facts of this case--
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.583,1347.62,"You can charge anything you want to as far as the federal Constitution is concerned, isn't that your case?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1347.62,1353.357,"--There is no monopoly and, therefore, the constraints will be practical constraints, not constitutional constraints."
1984.84-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1353.357,1355.976,"Well, Mr. Eagan, you say there is no monopoly."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1358.927,1360.943,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1390.962,1406.324,I guess whether there is a monopoly depends on how you define the market and how you define the market is going to determine the answer to the question and how big a chunk of the coastline do we look at in defining the market?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1406.324,1413.312,"Well, we have cited in our briefs the shoreline mileage that is subject to local control."
1984.84-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1443.414,1447.116,What do you say is the relevant market for our purposes?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1447.116,1453.287,I am not sure it is confined to marine terminal sites.
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.902,1483.424,"But, from a well to a pipeline going ashore."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1483.424,1484.224,Yes.
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.224,1486.776,That would be crossing state property too.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1486.776,1488.343,"Not in all cases, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.343,1497.382,"Not in all cases, but it certainly... Some wells located in some positions are going to have to have to cross state property."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1497.382,1498.232,Not necessarily.
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1503.536,1508.071,"I know, but if a well is in a certain location, it won't be in any position to do that."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1508.071,1513.475,"--Well, as a practical matter, Your Honor, most of the offshore--"
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.475,1516.76,Unless you take a terrific detour.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1516.76,1525.549,--As a practical matter the OCS development in California is off the southern part of the coast and that is where many of the grants are that go out to the three mile limit.
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1525.549,1533.221,"The right-of-way on which the pipeline is located is how much area, how much on either side of the pipeline?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1533.221,1537.94,I don't know a precise--
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1537.94,1539.54,It is a substantial amount I would assume.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1539.54,1539.856,--It is.
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.01,1553.783,Does that have possible impact on real estate development if that land... assuming it is otherwise highly suitable for real estate development?
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1557.918,1567.625,"Well, in many instances where that pipeline crosses up on property, which in most cases is private land, that might very well present a problem."
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1576.915,1596.86,"Would the possible diminution, if it could be demonstrated, diminution in assessed valuation of land for residential purposes and, therefore, a lower tax revenue on the part of the states or local governments be a factor to be taken into account in fixing this rent or this charge?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1596.86,1604.232,We view taxes of whatever source or whatever type as really entirely independent.
1984.84-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1615.44,1623.962,"Well, Mr. Eagan, as I understand it, your position is that subject to only the commerce clause that there is a monopoly."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1638.306,1639.706,That is correct.
1984.84-16,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.289,1645.693,"So, we would have to remand to the courts below for that determination in your view?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1645.693,1646.443,"--No at all, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.129,1678.664,They expressly said to the contrary in the last sentence of their opinion.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1678.664,1679.597,Excuse me?
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.597,1682.699,They expressly said the contrary in the last sentence of their opinion.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1688.017,1691.888,"Your Honor, with deference to the Ninth Circuit, that seems to me to be a throw-away line."
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.988,1698.042,They also limited their holding to tide and submerged lands.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1700.175,1702.744,--Certainly the regulation is not so limited.
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.528,1704.545,"--No, but the holding is."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1704.545,1713.801,"--Well, the wording is so limited, but the principle, it seems to me, carries you back much farther than inland, than the tidelands."
1984.84-16,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1780.113,1783.898,"They said that was proportionate to the amount of use, but here you have got vacant land."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1783.898,1805.494,"Well, it seems to me if we are going to try to draw a distinction between improved property, where, say, the port provides the wharf, and the situation that usually obtains here, unimproved ground, all that goes to, it seems to me, Your Honor, is the amount that is likely to be negotiated for the charge."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.943,1832.962,I don't understand why you draw a difference between whether there is a monopoly or not.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1859.546,1869.67,"I assume you would interpret that, Your Honor, the monopoly statement or the must use is confined to the context the court has discussed there, the renewal situation, the refinery adjacent to the lease."
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.67,1870.07,Well--
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1870.07,1879.025,I think it is clear the court is not there talking about or implying that the state has a monopoly up and down the California coastline.
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.977,1890.916,"--I agree, but it doesn't have a monopoly over these particular sites because of the permanency of these facilities, refineries, etcetera."
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1890.916,1896.32,The critical consideration seems to us in deciding whether a monopoly exists--
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.32,1907.627,"Let's just assume that there was a monopoly, that we said that the state has a monopoly at least with respect to a lot of these sites, what are we supposed to do then under your view?"
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1907.627,1910.746,--It is a threshold response.
1984.84-16,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.085,1948.085,Thank you very much.
1984.84-16,0,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,1948.085,1949.204,We are not saying there is no scrutiny.
1984.84-16,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1953.323,1954.523,We will see.
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,1969.951,1973.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2229.284,2231.653,What is the percentage of private?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2231.653,2234.588,--Private ownership is on the order of two percent.
1984.84-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2234.588,2241.992,"What is the breakdown between the City of Los Angeles, say, and then the state in Southern California?"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2241.992,2246.229,The City of Los Angeles in general owns the tidelands.
1984.84-16,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2296.812,2300.68,How does it break down on the shore-line as such?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2300.68,2310.036,"--The shoreline, I won't quarrel... if you are just going along the beach, I would not quarrel with the figures that the Attorney General has given us."
1984.84-16,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2316.94,2318.273,That doesn't tell the whole story.
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2318.273,2318.856,"--No, it doesn't."
1984.84-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.856,2322.141,You have to look out in the ocean a little bit.
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2322.141,2332.347,You have to look out in the ocean and that is the reason for the difference between the 400 versus 1200 miles or more that they quote in the 92 versus 98 percent we quote.
1984.84-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2332.347,2337.735,"Well, Mr. Eagan, do you think the position that the state must grant a right-of-way."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2337.735,2341.536,"Mr. Verleger, but I don't mind."
1984.84-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2341.536,2343.452,"Excuse me, yes, Mr. Verleger."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2343.452,2353.927,"Your Honor, our position that certainly the state has discretion when it came to particular decisions as to where rights-of-ways would be taken."
1984.84-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2413.048,2422.571,"It is different for what reason in your view, Mr. Verleger, because of the connection with the coastline?"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2422.571,2440.716,The state's own decisions say that the state holds this property as trustee for purposes of commerce and navigation.
1984.84-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.857,2454.959,"Well, is that a state law point that--"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2454.959,2458.427,There is a state constitutional provision in addition that says the same thing.
1984.84-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.427,2462.213,--Is part of your argument based on state law?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2464.981,2477.741,"I would use that... Well, I guess it is accurate to say that that fragment of my argument mentions that proposition."
1984.84-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2498.321,2505.308,"--So, your reasoning that you submit to us is limited to tide and submerged lands?"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2505.308,2509.094,Our lawsuit relates only to tide and submerged lands.
1984.84-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.129,2512.096,That is all you are leasing from the state.
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2512.096,2515.331,At least it is all we are leasing in this case.
1984.84-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2520.783,2531.091,And those leases cover lands that are used to carry oil from somewhere else?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2531.091,2546.616,"Those leases cover basically lands that are used for pipelines to bring oil from ships that are anchored either by docks or in some instances out at sea in water that is two or three hundred feet deep, to bring that in to the refinery."
1984.84-16,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.903,2645.68,"Well, supposing that California had totally socialized real property, that only the state owned real property, and your clients wanted to lease a place from the state to have a service station and it was in Bakersfield, it had nothing to do with the coastline at all."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2659.374,2667.38,"When it comes to leasing land they owned in Bakersfield for a service station, I don't know of any barrier to their leasing whatever they want."
1984.84-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2695.78,2704.069,"Well, can the state, Mr. Verleger, charge a reasonable rent under your view?"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2704.069,2706.255,There is no question in my mind but that they can.
1984.84-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2707.488,2710.64,"Well, the state court said this was a reasonable rent."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2710.64,2727.584,"--Well, the state court was reviewing that in terms of its standard for the review of an administrative agency, its decision, which at least in California... and actually a legislative decision."
1984.84-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2746.763,2751.3,"Well, if a volumetric rent is a typical sort of a rent for pipeline use--"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2751.3,2751.984,It isn't.
1984.84-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2751.984,2753.902,--It is not?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2753.902,2754.519,No.
1984.84-16,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2754.519,2756.769,"If it were, would it be reasonable."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2756.769,2765.225,In this particular instance I would say not because the Constitution... take imports first.
1984.84-16,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2818.842,2822.496,"Counsel, what would you consider to be a reasonable rent?"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2822.496,2827.965,"--Well, I would consider... They fixed one before, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2870.06,2872.679,You consider the other more rental?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2872.679,2879.333,The other is more rent and the answer is since it is fixed on the basis of the commodity--
1984.84-16,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2879.333,2881.868,"And, it is unreasonable."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,2881.868,2884.451,--More than unreasonable.
1984.84-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3101.644,3109.88,"Mr. Verleger, I guess there is no doubt that Congress couldn't allow California by statute to charge these rents."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3109.88,3110.582,Congress could.
1984.84-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3110.582,3114.717,And there would be no commerce or--
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3114.717,3117.903,There would be no commerce clause problem clearly on import/export.
1984.84-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3117.903,3118.553,"--Oh, really?"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3118.553,3119.538,"Well, I--"
1984.84-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3119.538,3121.205,Did Congress authorize that?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3121.205,3126.609,"--Well, I hadn't thought since... The two are different, that is all I mean to say."
1984.84-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3129.794,3135.031,There is nothing the Submerged Lands Act or any other statute would suggest--
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3135.031,3137.083,I have found no congressional act.
1984.84-16,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3158.646,3163.134,"--Incidentally, suppose California sold this whole coastline to private interest."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3165.934,3171.038,The answer is I think I don't know.
1984.84-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.394,3184.463,You would probably find a right of immanent domain in a pipeline company.
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3184.463,3188.832,Some have it that might be used.
1984.84-16,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3190.867,3193.217,"Exactly, you don't."
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3193.217,3199.204,May I ask just one question on your theory?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3199.204,3199.387,Sure.
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.387,3206.858,"Are you taking the position that no matter how reasonable the level of the rent might be, they can never use the volumetric formula?"
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3206.858,3220.117,It is our sense that... particularly under the import/export clause that the volumetric formula applied on imports produces exactly the same result as a tariff in the same amount.
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.856,3262.027,"And, is it your understanding of the Ninth Circuit that that is what they held; that you cannot use this formula for the tidelands and the submerged lands on the border of the state."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3262.027,3264.396,I believe they so held.
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3264.396,3265.179,Regardless of amount?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3266.513,3271.233,Also I have found... I think their view was that the amount was unreasonable too.
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.233,3276.037,"--I understand, but I couldn't quite tell whether one would have done it without the other."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3276.037,3280.489,"One never knows for sure, but my view is--"
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.489,3283.441,But your view is that it is that on either ground independent of the other.
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3283.441,3303.354,"--I also urge, even though the cases I have to rely on are older, that a straight tariff, something that says you have got to pay fifty cents a bushel or a barrel to come into a state... into California from Nevada, for instance, unless justified under the rules of the user taxes, would be bad."
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3311.626,3317.178,You defend the lower court's commerce clause holding as well as the import/export?
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3317.178,3317.53,I do.
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.53,3319.497,"But, you would prefer a decision on the latter."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3319.497,3322.749,"Well, we are concerned with both because--"
1984.84-16,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3322.749,3333.79,"Well, I know, but in the commerce clause one... That argument wouldn't necessarily... You wouldn't necessarily win on that based on any volumetric no matter how small."
1984.84-16,1,38409,philip_k_verleger,,3333.79,3334.507,--No.
1984.84-16,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3498.413,3504.367,"You have two minutes remaining, Mr. Eagan."
1984.84-16,2,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,3504.367,3505.067,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3609.6,3611.368,"Mr. Eagan, can I ask just one question?"
1984.84-16,2,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,3621.842,3624.711,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-16,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3657.183,3657.683,Your time has expired now.
1984.84-16,2,20820,dennis_m_eagan,,3657.683,3658.299,Thank you.
1984.84-16,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3658.299,3659.566,"Thank you, gentlemen."
