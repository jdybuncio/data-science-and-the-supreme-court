2009.08-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.654,"We will hear argument next today in Case 08-1175, Florida v. Powell."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,7.904,24.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As courts have recognized, Miranda warnings protect Fifth Amendment rights and promote voluntary confessions, confessions important to seeking truth, solving crimes, and securing justice."
2009.08-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,66.292,76.148,But you agree that it -- suppose we accept your position and the case is remanded.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,95.076,0.0,"Your Honor, the Florida court theoretically could, but the Florida court would have to do that on State grounds, and in this case, they relied on Federal grounds to reach this decision--"
2009.08-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.517,0.0,"Yes, that's what I meant."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,107.683,108.267,--Theoretically.
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.395,125.478,Are the Florida Supreme Court elected?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,126.578,128.596,Your Honor--
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.596,130.981,"Are they elected judges, the Florida Supreme Court?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,130.981,136.452,"--Your Honor, the Florida Supreme Court members are first appointed, and then they are subsequently elected."
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.452,138.535,How -- how long is their term?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,140.57,141.037,Correct.
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.356,143.439,Every 4 years.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,151.909,155.247,"Well, Your Honor, they are elected."
2009.08-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.247,162.751,Has the -- has the Florida Supreme Court ever explicitly interpreted -- what is it?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,172.773,173.892,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,181.462,183.814,"Well, they did it in this case, didn't they?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,191.836,192.853,"--No, Justice--"
2009.08-1175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,192.853,194.288,So they did do it in this very case.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,194.288,195.572,"--No, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-1175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,199.859,202.811,"But it also cited the -- the Florida Constitution, did it not?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,202.811,204.928,It cited the Florida Constitution--
2009.08-1175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,204.928,209.548,"And did it not also say that this was a violation of the Federal -- I mean, of the Florida Constitution?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,209.548,212.666,"--Yes, Your Honor, it mentioned the Florida Constitution."
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,228.525,241.917,One of your amici -- one of the amici suggested that the Florida courts cannot read the Florida Constitution more expansively than the Federal requirements.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,245.054,246.687,"We do indeed, Your Honor."
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.827,255.76,And it's a different question.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,269.586,276.923,"Well, Your Honor, the past cases have said that the Florida court could, but they haven't."
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,279.375,283.846,"So this could be a first, if we were to start from the proposition that Justice Ginsburg did?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,283.846,295.82,"Well, Your Honor, under Michigan v. Long the test is to look at the clear face of the opinion, to look for a plain statement that this case relied on adequate -- adequate and independent State grounds, and that is not there."
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,295.82,314.381,Do -- do you see a conflict between the language of our decisions where we often say that Miranda rights have to be clear and those decisions that say that whatever is said has to reasonably convey the essence of the Miranda warnings?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,321.804,326.689,"Your Honor, in Miranda the Court did use the terms ""clearly inform""."
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,336.728,342.199,"So you would suggest that if something is not clear and it's ambiguous, that that's enough?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,352.405,363.778,"--No, Your Honor, I would say that this Court has said that clarity is judged by whether the warnings reasonably convey the rights under Miranda; that's the standard."
2009.08-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,363.778,377.788,"Did Miranda itself -- I mean, it set out the four requirements, but there was a charge -- I mean there was a warning involved, am I not right?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,390.18,394.898,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and that warning conveyed only the right to attorney."
2009.08-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.099,399.218,It also said you have a right to keep silent.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,399.218,400.501,--Correct.
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.953,432.257,"It told them: You are entitled to confer with counsel before answering questions, right?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,432.257,436.291,"What warning, Justice Scalia?"
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.291,438.926,Wasn't that -- wasn't that the warning given -- given in this case?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,442.211,447.263,"Yes, the warning in this case said you have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of our questions."
2009.08-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,448.346,451.148,"Now, ""any"" -- just to make sure; you've said two different things."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,452.965,455.433,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the warning said,"
2009.08-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,471.294,474.913,What about the right in Miranda that says -- in Miranda --
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,505.9,509.152,"Well, Your Honor, the standard being ""reasonably convey""--"
2009.08-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,509.152,509.703,Yes.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,509.703,512.371,--the warning lays out that you have the right--
2009.08-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,512.371,514.488,I'm just asking you to point to the words that tell him that.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,514.488,516.907,--The right to talk to a lawyer.
2009.08-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,516.907,518.692,Don't have you a right to talk to a lawyer at a grand jury?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,518.692,0.0,"Yes, but a -- Your Honor, a grand jury operates very differently than a criminal interrogation--"
2009.08-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,523.644,0.0,"Yes, correct."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,550.627,553.496,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I would have three responses to that."
2009.08-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.483,561.017,"It doesn't use the word ""present"", Miranda?"
2009.08-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,584.366,598.192,"It -- it used it in determining -- in -- in stating the obligation of the State, but it didn't use those words in setting out the warning that the FBI then gave."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,598.192,599.325,--Correct.
2009.08-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.325,607.548,"It said, this is what -- States, this is what your obligation is, what you must say to the defendant is."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,645.504,651.825,"Justice Ginsburg, let me be very clear and answer Justice Breyer with the three points I began."
2009.08-1175,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.866,691.385,"Well, what FBI are we talking about?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,723.254,725.854,"--Your Honor, the current FBI warning does have that."
2009.08-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,736.062,749.202,"The -- the warning that Justice Breyer has just referred to -- that's long after Miranda itself, and it was not the warning that the FBI gave at the time of Miranda."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,749.202,750.237,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,772.485,779.841,--I have a difficulty in terms of this argument about burdening law enforcement.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,784.476,785.51,--Correct.
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.51,796.45,So what's the added burden by making the form absolutely and abundantly clear or conforming the form to the statements in Miranda?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,806.341,812.895,"Your Honor, there are three reasons why the Florida Supreme Court's explicit standard is problematic."
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,838.543,847.816,"Well, there is a question about how much the subjective intent of the questioner should be involved in this process or not."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,891.993,893.578,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2009.08-1175,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,901.998,902.434,But why?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,908.236,915.991,"Well, Your Honor, we would claim that this warning falls within the 97 percent cited by amici because it has the word ""during"" in the warning."
2009.08-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,966.341,974.178,"What about the danger that Tampa, if you should prevail, will go back to the old way?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,990.806,998.395,"Your Honor, you are correct, in that Tampa has a new form now that does have the words ""present"" and ""during"" in a different formulation."
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.155,1021.741,"Well, once we say this is properly given, my goodness, here's -- here's an instruction approved specifically by this Court."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,1034.751,1042.222,"--Well, Your Honor, law enforcement agencies will look to courts for approval of this -- of their warnings."
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.007,0.0,"Well, you have to say it's okay."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,1059.517,1060.833,"--Well, Justice Scalia, as a--"
2009.08-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.833,1061.719,It's not your position?
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,1061.719,1068.122,"--Justice Scalia, they theoretically could, because the warning was reasonably conveyed."
2009.08-1175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.578,1079.244,Let me -- let me ask you one question.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,1103.926,1112.232,"--Well, Justice Stevens, it is not true that every jurisdiction in Florida uses this same warning."
2009.08-1175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.001,1119.803,"That's true, but if you -- if they all followed the Florida Supreme Court in this case, then they all would use the same warning?"
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,1119.803,1128.475,"Well, Justice Stevens, if they were all following the Florida Supreme Court here, they would have to explicitly state certain terms in their warning."
2009.08-1175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.475,1130.261,Which most of them do already.
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,1130.261,1131.879,"Well, not necessarily."
2009.08-1175,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.446,1133.263,"Not all, but some."
2009.08-1175,0,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,1133.263,1142.334,"--Some -- some do, some do not, and one of the fears in having an express advice standard is that you will have continuing terms that are required."
2009.08-1175,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1181.627,1182.311,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1192.684,1208.713,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to go directly to Justice Ginsburg's question about what would happen if this Court affirmed the warnings in this case, and I think Respondent's amici make the argument that it will somehow promote a race to the bottom."
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1240.415,1252.323,"Except that Justice Scalia just pointed out, if we approve the language of this, then -- of this particular warning, it becomes the new sort of floor."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1267.565,1268.767,"--Well, Justice--"
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1268.767,1269.9,Aren't we encouraging that?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1269.9,1280.325,"--Justice Sotomayor, I have two responses to that: The first is that this Court upheld the warning in Duckworth, which said, we have no way of providing you an attorney, but one will be provided if and when you go to court."
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1300.304,1301.322,How many after Duckworth?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1302.272,1311.127,"--I don't -- it doesn't indicate when they were adopted, but I think it's fair to say that, if police did have that incentive, that we would have seen at least some jurisdictions adopt that warning."
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1311.127,1312.06,So we don't know how many--
2009.08-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.06,1321.749,"But your case has to be that, if we adopt the Petitioner's petition, it's perfectly fine for every jurisdiction in the country to use this warning, right?"
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1321.749,1326.053,"We agree that this warning is adequate, and our position is--"
2009.08-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1326.053,1329.922,"And every jurisdiction in the country can use it, so we can -- we can talk about whether or not it's adequate."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1329.922,1341.147,"--They can, and we think that's unlikely, and if the concern here is that it will destroy the uniformity that the Federal government thinks is a good thing as a matter of policy, we think that that concern is simply not warranted."
2009.08-1175,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1345.848,1346.148,Excuse me.
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1347.883,1371.849,"--No, we think that affirming these warnings will not disrupt the uniformity that seems to be in place around the country, and -- for exactly the reason that I said, Justice Kennedy, because Justice Sotomayor mentioned general right to counsel warnings, that if we upheld a general right to counsel warning, that jurisdictions would begin to drop the more specific language that's contained, for example, in the FBI form."
2009.08-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1372.099,1372.849,Where -- where is that?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1379.019,1381.455,--I don't believe the FBI form is set out in full.
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1410.557,1428.436,"--What -- how do we deal with the fact that, if the purpose of Miranda is to give clear warnings, and your adversary says -- not your adversary -- your co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel says that means -- ""clear"" means does it reasonably convey?"
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1445.897,1447.363,"--No, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1454.919,1459.371,Are you calling the Florida State Supreme Court majority unreasonable jurists?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1459.371,1478.618,"No, I think -- I think the problem with a standard that permits of no ambiguity is that, as Florida just said, this standard will apply, not just to printed forms -- and it is easy enough to create a printed form in advance that includes more specific language -- but it will also apply to inadvertent departures from the standard forms as a result of mistake."
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1478.618,1489.074,"What happens now is that we are dealing with the exception rather than the rule, and -- but this was the rule, meaning this was the form that they were reading."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1504.936,1512.423,"Well, I think -- I think the exception is -- needs to be captured within the rule that this Court adopts as -- as the standard."
2009.08-1175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.449,1537.99,"Mr. O'Neil, isn't one of the problems here that Florida had two different printed forms before this case arose, and that Florida Supreme Court has said they'll all have the same one hereafter?"
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1537.99,1542.025,"--Justice Stevens, I'm not aware that Florida had two printed forms."
2009.08-1175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.827,1546.763,So at least two of them?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1546.763,1550.731,"--Well, every jurisdiction adopts a slightly--"
2009.08-1175,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.731,1554.35,And isn't it -- isn't it wiser generally to have the same form used throughout the State?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1554.35,1555.45,--It is.
2009.08-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.17,1563.289,"And the Constitution requires it, right?"
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1563.289,1566.658,"--Well, no, the Constitution does not require the precise words of Miranda."
2009.08-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.658,1578.215,"Well, Miranda supposedly says the Constitution requires this warning, and if the warning must be in a standard form that everybody uses, the Constitution must require a standard form that everybody uses."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1578.215,1584.285,"Nowhere in Miranda does it say that a -- a standard form is necessary, and this Court summarily rejected exactly that argument."
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1584.285,1584.585,Excuse me.
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1585.969,1586.452,Yes.
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1586.452,1588.504,--to the question of why these are adequate?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1593.558,1596.427,"Justice Breyer, these warnings state three rights: The right--"
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1596.427,1596.943,But there were four.
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1607.299,1607.985,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1607.985,1609.301,"Now, that's one of the four."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1620.458,1634.135,"Justice Breyer, there is no reason to think that a suspect who hears that he can talk to an attorney before answering any questions and during this interview would infer the unstated restriction that he can talk to an attorney but only by phone or only remotely--"
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1634.135,1634.402,Really?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1642.139,0.0,--But for the same reason we don't ask whether the suspect has sufficient knowledge to supplement the information he needs.
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.812,0.0,"No, no, no."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1654.43,1655.899,"Well, it--"
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1655.899,1662.453,"Now, you then repeat, you can assert that right whenever you want, to talk to him before questioning."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1662.453,1662.886,--Well--
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1662.886,1685.418,"And my question is, how does that tell him he has a right to have a lawyer with him during questioning, that the questioning he has a right to have take place from beginning to end in the presence of a lawyer, a matter that the Miranda Court repeated three times in the summary and wrote eight full paragraphs about why that was important?"
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1685.418,1691.639,"--Well, first, as Justice Ginsburg noted, Miranda went out of its way to -- to specifically approve an FBI warning that said, quote--"
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.639,1693.122,Where does it say it approves that?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1693.122,1697.543,--It said this pattern of warnings is consistent with the decision that we announced today.
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.143,1698.876,"It wasn't though, actually."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1698.876,1698.959,--it couldn't have been clearer.
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.959,1700.559,It isn't -- it isn't consistent with it.
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1701.326,1705.196,"Well, that argument was made by Justice Clark in dissent, and the Court did not agree with that."
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1708.065,1709.715,They didn't say anything about during.
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1709.715,1711.35,"--Well, no, they didn't."
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.35,1722.907,"So anyway -- then they don't need to mention FBI warning at that time, J. Edgar Hoover's letter or whatever it was, just talked about telling you, you have a right to counsel."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1724.474,1729.811,"Well, I think that's exactly the point, that you don't assume that a suspect is only capable of understanding--"
2009.08-1175,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1729.811,1735.529,"So then you think that, in fact, going by that warning, that there is no constitutional right to have them say a word about during."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1737.815,1748.356,"--I think a -- a -- advice of the right to counsel or, as the Court put it in a different place in the Miranda opinion, the right to obtain the services of an attorney of his choice, that would be constitutionally adequate."
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1787.414,1793.385,"Just so I get the bottom line -- if all this warning had said was, you have a right to a lawyer before questioning--"
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1793.385,1795.42,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1795.42,1797.956,--You have a right to a lawyer before questioning--
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1797.956,1798.556,"Well, we think that--"
2009.08-1175,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1798.556,1802.074,--it would be your position that standing alone that would be enough?
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1802.074,1817.083,"--We think that -- that -- that was the warning that this Court confronted in Bridgers, and we think that would be a much closer and more difficult case, but we think that, yes, we -- we agree with the decision cited in our brief that a suspect would not assume that that attorney will become unavailable the minute the first question is asked."
2009.08-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1817.9,1818.369,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1175,1,21324,david_oneil,,1818.369,1818.702,--Thank you.
2009.08-1175,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1818.702,1837.83,Ms. Brueckheimer.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1837.83,1860.362,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Clearly, Miranda could not have been more specific when it said an individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation."
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1860.962,1861.462,So the--
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1861.462,1862.412,--at 471.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1862.412,1867.783,--So the FBI warning that was specifically approved in Miranda was inconsistent with Miranda?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1867.783,1872.17,I disagree with that representation that it was approved of.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.42,1877.122,It says consistent -- consistent with the procedure which we delineate today.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1877.122,1878.657,--Consistent with is not the same.
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1889.964,1890.13,Could you tell us where that is?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1893.082,1893.366,--Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.82,1903.105,It set forth the substance of what had to be conveyed--
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1903.105,1903.755,--Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.755,1911.393,"--but it set forth, on page 484, its belief that the FBI warning adequately conveyed that substance."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1917.047,1920.333,"Yes, I have the warning."
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.749,1921.599,--You want to read it?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1921.599,1922.601,"Yes, I can read it."
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.601,1923.035,Good.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1923.035,1940.73,"The -- the warning says that -- let's see -- at the -- at the outset of the interview that he is not required to make a statement, that any statement may be used against him in court, and that the individual may obtain the services of an attorney of his own choice."
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.765,1947.717,"Well, I mean, that's so much worse than -- than--"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1947.717,1948.884,"--Yes, and the purpose of--"
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.884,1949.436,--what you have here.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1949.436,1960.541,"--of saying this was because the question was, is this going to be burdensome to the government, to the police to issue these warden -- these warnings?"
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1967.195,1967.795,What page are you on now?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,1967.795,1969.128,--We are still on 483.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1992.541,1999.497,"Well, maybe, but it says -- it says the -- what the FBI -- the pattern of warning -- well, let me make sure I get it exact."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2014.323,2015.823,--Consistent with but not identical.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2015.823,2016.839,"Well, okay."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2021.893,2029.297,"No, I -- in all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that this Court went a little further and required the presence of counsel."
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2030.081,2036.218,Then how is the FBI warning consistent with the procedure the Court delineated in Miranda?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2036.218,2041.288,--It doesn't say that the -- the attorney has to be present with--
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2041.288,2042.473,"No, I said how is it--"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2042.473,2043.573,--How is it consistent?
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2043.573,2043.99,--Yes.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2043.99,2060.0,"It -- because it -- it gave three of the basic -- you know, you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, the services of an attorney; and that you have the right to -- or any -- any statement you make will be used against you."
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2063.285,2066.154,So I would say that it's not consistent with Miranda.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2066.154,2069.856,"It's -- it's consistent to a point, but it--"
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2069.856,2070.422,Okay.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2070.422,2075.54,"--And just as if -- and -- and they have added in, more recently, the right to free counsel."
2009.08-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.54,2085.412,"Well, while you're looking at whether it would be an undue burden on law enforcement, it was -- it has a burden that's consistent with the ones that Miranda required expressly."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2085.412,2086.962,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.348,2094.602,"I say when you were inquiring, as you were at that part of the opinion, into how burdensome it would be on law enforcement to give these warnings--"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2094.602,2095.202,--Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.202,2100.403,--you are saying the burden would be consistent under the new warnings with those previously given by the FBI.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2100.403,2100.886,Correct.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2107.175,2114.913,What it says is that the respect for the rights of the individual followed in the FBI is consistent with.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2114.913,2117.381,Uh-huh.
2009.08-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2136.576,2149.418,"The bottom line in my mind -- the question is, whether these warnings are substantively or otherwise different than the FBI warnings that some believe were approved in Miranda."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2152.87,2164.678,I don't -- I believe that -- that requiring the presence of counsel during the interrogation goes a little bit -- a lot further.
2009.08-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2167.63,2169.23,"I don't disagree with you, but that wasn't my question."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2174.034,2175.384,At issue in Miranda?
2009.08-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2175.384,2177.736,--Not at issue because it wasn't at issue.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2177.736,2178.702,It wasn't.
2009.08-1175,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2178.702,2182.889,"But that was reviewed and approved in Miranda, did it give that--"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2182.889,2183.955,"No, it did not."
2009.08-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.495,2207.338,"Is -- is there since then -- I mean, as I read it now I see that, as I said, it seems very clear that they intend you to have to say that the counsel has to be -- is present with you."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2213.825,2214.359,"No, they don't."
2009.08-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.359,2214.861,They don't.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2214.861,2215.461,They do not.
2009.08-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.461,2215.861,Okay.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2242.844,2248.915,"No, the case law has always referred to both, both by this Court and then -- and then the circuit courts."
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.248,2250.682,This Court said in Miranda--
2009.08-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.682,2251.784,"--This Court has referred to ""during""."
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.784,2252.267,--Yes.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2252.267,2259.104,"--Has -- has -- in many opinions, it talked about before interrogation and during interrogation the right to have counsel present."
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.104,2263.322,But I must say I -- this is -- this is angels dancing on the head of a pin.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2294.308,2299.995,"No, Your Honor, especially not with a reasonable suspect that's being questioned."

2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2347.943,2351.845,--never -- never asked him did you knowingly waive; did you intelligently waive?
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2379.912,2381.464,--Was she asking her client a legal question?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2388.201,2389.001,Yes.
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2398.423,2407.079,Do you think that the average person hearing this warning would envision the sort of procedure that occurs before a grand jury?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2407.079,2407.681,I don't--
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2407.681,2408.614,That's what it would be taken to mean?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2408.614,2415.101,"--I -- I don't think most -- most people have been in front of a grand jury, so I don't envision that they would have that kind of reaction."
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2415.101,2415.934,But do--
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2415.934,2416.951,"I think they would focus on the ""before""."

2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2445.453,2451.624,And a right -- but they never told him that he'd have the ability to talk to a lawyer during the interrogation.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2451.624,2460.13,Is there -- is there any -- I'm not sure this is pertinent -- but is there any malevolent reason Tampa police would adopt this warning?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2477.424,2482.828,It's -- it's hard for us to be able to delve into the minds of the Tampa Police Department and the people who create these forms.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2517.198,2520.649,--So -- and you can't think of any bad reason they might have done it.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2520.649,2544.598,"Well, Professor Leo could, and there is a memo he attaches at the end of his appendix in the amicus brief, but I -- I would just say that it doesn't really matter what the motives are, and that it all depends on how the defendant or the person in custody is -- is perceiving these warnings and whether he's getting the information he or she needs to be--"
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2544.598,2563.826,What do you do with the -- the Court's decisions in Prysock and Duckworth that dealt with the right to appointed counsel and the suspect was not explicitly told that he had a right to appointed counsel at the pre-arraignment stage.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2565.761,2566.294,--Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2583.07,2590.243,"--You wouldn't have to have any additional information; you just tell them, you have a right to have a -- have counsel now."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2591.326,2599.432,"--Well, they -- in Prysock it was a matter of the order, but in Duckworth it was, we can't get one for you at this moment kind of thing."
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2605.669,2610.971,"Didn't one of them say ""court"", and the suspect was not in court at the time?"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2610.971,2612.923,Was not in court?
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2612.923,2613.423,Yes.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2616.608,2617.025,Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2633.301,2644.959,"If this warning is read the way we might -- lawyers might read a statute or a contract or something like that, then I don't know why saying,"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2656.85,2658.785,No.
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2658.785,2659.835,Would you agree with that?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2659.835,2665.705,"Except for that -- that catch-all phrase that they used at the bottom, which is you have the right to use any of these at any time."
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2665.705,2667.074,"Do you think that is defective, too?"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2667.074,2681.75,"Well, I think that it -- it's probably okay as far as reinforcing the right to remain silent and informing him that any of your answers can be used against you, but I don't think it salvages a right that's not there, which is the right to presence during interrogation."
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2681.75,2692.44,"So once you break your -- you have the right to remain silent, but once you break that right, the fact that you have that right to use that right to remain silent in the future doesn't mean you can stop answering questions."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2692.44,2705.265,"Well, the -- the catch-all phrase might inform them that they could stop, but, clearly, if they had the right to presence of counsel with them, that might--"
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2705.265,2706.149,We could write that down.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2707.532,2708.134,--Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.679,2806.279,"Well, they are -- they are free to do that."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2820.022,2820.455,--Correct.
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2822.324,2824.759,"Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that's the case."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2838.75,2839.185,Well--
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2839.185,2840.252,--in that case.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2840.252,2847.356,"--the Florida Supreme Court must have referred to its constitutional provision, Article I, section 9, at least five times."
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2847.356,2850.458,"And in each time, it said that it was by extension from Miranda."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2854.278,2854.912,Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2855.595,2856.462,--that it certified.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2856.462,2862.032,"--It's almost like Miranda is being used as a generic concept for warnings -- you know, we're complying with Miranda--"
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.032,2870.704,"That's the whole reason we have jurisdiction, so that Miranda will not be confused, and so that it won't be a hazard on the landscape when people say ""Miranda"" and they mean something else."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2870.704,2872.073,"--Right, but -- you know--"
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2872.073,2879.81,And it's not at all clear that the Washington -- that the Florida Supreme Court could in this case go back to the Constitution.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2882.279,2887.499,"--You can't go lower than the Federal Constitution, but they can give more rights."
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2887.499,2889.515,It's -- maybe in some other case.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2893.134,2909.995,"Well, in -- in Traylor, which is the court that -- it's the case that the -- the Florida Supreme Court and the decision below relied heavily upon, they said that we are the ceiling and the court is the bottom, and--"
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2909.995,2922.22,"But you have no case in which the Florida Supreme Court has explicitly said that we have a warning that is more strict, more rigorous than what Miranda requires?"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2922.922,2940.817,"--No, and they -- they didn't feel like they had to -- to deviate, because they felt like their definition of presence of counsel, which was the right to consult with an attorney before and the right to have counsel present during the interrogation, was consistent with the holdings in Miranda."
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.137,2952.105,"I'm curious: When this goes back to them, do you think they can deviate?"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2977.054,2983.308,"--I believe they can, because as long as they are not going below what this Court mandates--"
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.308,2984.308,"Well, but that--"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2984.308,2985.493,--if they provide more protections.
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.493,2987.16,--But that wasn't the question asked of them.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2990.563,2991.397,Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.18,2997.217,"That's really not -- that's really not quite accurate, because they used the term ""Miranda warnings"" generically--"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,2997.217,2998.25,"--Generically, and--"
2009.08-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.25,3007.156,"--as opposed to a category of warnings which are required by both the Federal Constitution and the State constitution, and they said it violated the State constitution."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3007.156,3007.973,"--Yes, they did."
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3023.733,3032.438,"Well, except the words that it quoted from the lower court opinion -- that is, we are talking about the -- the Fifth Amendment, and by extension, Article I, section 9."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3032.438,3033.254,--Right.
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3033.254,3037.908,"So that seems to me to indicate that it's incorporating, not going further."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3037.908,3038.825,"Well, if -- if--"
2009.08-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.825,3041.694,That's not in the question they -- they took.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3041.694,3042.644,--No.
2009.08-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3065.56,3065.91,I think the opposite.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3068.944,3083.687,"Well -- and, again, I would say that they -- they agree that we are traveling along the same road, but they have -- they have -- they are stressing the fact that they have set a line in the sand as far as what they're interpreting the right to presence--"
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3083.687,3084.387,I think--
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.387,3094.495,"Well, the question asked: Does the failure to provide express advice of the right to the presence of counsel during questioning vitiate Miranda warnings?"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3109.088,3118.21,"--And, of course, if they did violate the baseline, the minimum standard set forth in Miranda--"
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.21,3118.51,Right.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3118.51,3120.646,--then it would be unconstitutional.
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.646,3120.996,Absolutely.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3120.996,3135.906,"So -- which is why Traylor and the Florida constitution kept making -- because they didn't have to really get to what the bottom or the baseline or the minimum standard was, as long as Florida had set forth a standard--"
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.906,3152.498,"Well, that's true, but -- but if they -- if they felt the authority to go beyond Miranda, wouldn't they have had to say no to this question, if we find that way, and then go on to say: But it does violate our own?"
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3156.616,3162.02,--And I believe the idea that they didn't think it was deviating from the Miranda case.
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.02,3162.604,Right.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3162.987,3173.661,"But if this Court finds that it does, then they -- they will probably -- and I feel confident that they would fall back on the constitution -- of the Florida constitution."
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3173.661,3195.825,"--But they did say over and over again -- one was the certified question; another was the issue before the court is whether the failure to provide express advice of the right to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation violates the principles espoused in Miranda, with the citation."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3207.566,3233.031,"Well, they do have a section in looking at, you know, other circuit courts in the Federal system, and all -- what our Florida courts are doing, and -- which is when they get into the concept of -- well, they start out talking about Traylor and our constitution at the beginning, and they -- they repeat it at the end because they believe it is consistent with."
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3245.672,3252.761,I think you would have had a much weightier argument if it hadn't been for Michigan v. Long.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3254.444,3255.544,It -- it would have been nice.
2009.08-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3256.179,3264.901,--We could have then remanded to ask the Florida Supreme Court: Was it independently ruling under its constitution?
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3264.901,3267.603,I -- I will keep that in mind.
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3357.44,3363.344,"Well, you said that the average person wouldn't take this warning to mean -- to -- wouldn't envision a procedure like the grand jury procedure."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3366.463,3386.542,"--That he -- that once questioning starts, that he -- he has no right to consult with a lawyer anymore, and it certainly doesn't -- and tell him that he has the right to the presence of an attorney with him in an interrogation room, where the coercion takes on a highly new meaning."
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3390.511,3392.53,But the latter part of that is the grand jury question.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3396.398,3402.886,--I don't -- I don't believe -- any -- any of the normal reasonable suspects are -- would probably be even aware of what the grand jury proceeding was about.
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3402.886,3403.119,Okay.
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3416.145,3417.945,"Correct, and I'm not the only one."
2009.08-1175,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3443.213,3449.367,"Well, all of those people are lawyers, and lawyers are known to read legal documents very precisely."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3451.417,3453.419,"--Correct, and in this case--"
2009.08-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3453.419,3455.02,"--Sometimes, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3455.636,3456.803,--Yes.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3485.29,3492.294,"You -- you think it's a good thing, though, that they changed their forms to track the FBI form after -- after this litigation started."
2009.08-1175,2,20522,deborah_k_brueckheimer,,3492.294,3492.61,--I -- I -- yes.
2009.08-1175,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3520.213,3521.479,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1175,3,31193,joseph_w_jacquot,,3525.265,3530.835,"Mr. Chief Justice, let me make three brief points, after responding to a question that Justice Stevens asked."
