2014.13-435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.141,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 13435, Omnicare, Incorporated v. the Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,14.158,16.443,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,71.946,90.074,"So if I say or the company says in a prospectus, we believe that we have 3.5 million units of inventory in our secret inventory warehouse, so long as they say we believe, they can't 11 you know, it turns out they have none, that's all right?"
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,90.758,98.847,"I think that that would probably be a statement of opinion, but it is much closer to the line between statements of opinion and statements of fact."
2014.13-435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,99.43,111.154,"Really, you think it's an open question if they say it's a very precise number for something that only they know anything about, and it's wildly off, you think they're protected or may be simply by saying “ We believe ”?"
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,111.154,131.651,"--Well, I -- I -- think that -- the reason why I think it's a close question as to whether or not that would be a statement of opinion is simply because the second restatement's definition of what constitutes a statement of opinion, which we think is a useful guide, includes not just statements on matters of judgment, like the statements we have at issue here, but also statements that express uncertainty about factual matters."
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,151.631,167.758,"But suppose it is actually disputed, an expert -- expert -- a museum expert on an archaeological mission says, it is my opinion that those bones in that mountain are of a diplodocus and not a Trisopterus."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,193.541,197.593,"So, Justice Breyer, first, that would be clearly a statement of opinion 2--"
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,197.593,197.862,Yes.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,197.862,199.795,--because it's a statement on a matter of judgment.
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,199.795,200.079,Yes.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,200.079,209.168,"Our view is that where the speaker does not say anything about the basis for its opinion, the only fact that is being conveyed is the fact of the speaker's belief."
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,209.837,210.387,Yes.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,232.766,233.968,--And so what I would 19--
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,233.968,239.189,"And that's now, that's the point I want you to address yourself to, why is that statement I just made wrong?"
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,239.189,239.739,--Sure.
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,239.739,240.939,It is my opinion it is right.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,240.939,247.276,"So notwithstanding so notwithstanding the fact that it in our view, Justice Breyer, there is no implied statement of fact there."
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,250.412,252.247,"There is an implied statement, I think."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,256.818,263.222,--Well and I think that we may end up ultimately getting to the same place because let me explain how we think the analysis would work in that situation.
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,263.222,263.505,Yeah.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,263.505,269.308,"In a situation like that, we believe that the ultimate legal inquiry is whether the speaker did not possess the stated belief."
2014.13-435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,289.289,303.53,"So you're saying that this evidence, what we're we're talking about, the evidence that the speaker didn't believe what he said, that could be proved by showing he made no investigation at all."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,303.53,304.381,--Yes.
2014.13-435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,304.699,317.289,So so you're saying that the whether there was any investigation or whether it was reasonable will factor into whether the belief was honestly held.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,317.289,318.439,"--Yes, that is correct."
2014.13-435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.891,322.76,But why and we're dealing with a registration statement.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,338.12,365.953,"--Well, we don't believe that there is any necessary implication from the statement, and we think that that is true regardless of whether or not it appears in a registration statement because, after all, in Section 11, while Congress certainly imposed a heightened obligation on issuers and did so by relaxing other elements of liability, Congress included exactly the same falsity element as it did in a variety of other provisions of the Federal securities law laws."
2014.13-435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,388.968,401.376,"Well, that may be true, but do you deny the fact that there can be situations in which a person makes a makes a statement of belief and believes that to be true, but lacks a reasonable basis for stating the belief?"
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,404.58,410.132,"I think there is a difference between those two situations, and I think this illustrates an important conceptual distinction."
2014.13-435,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,462.6,463.35,What's wrong with that?
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,491.369,493.805,"--So two points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.267,540.483,"Well, what about on a factual basis?"
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,540.483,542.052,I'm sorry?
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,542.052,543.285,Factual basis.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,545.421,547.273,"Well, again, I think there's a meaningful difference."
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,548.423,549.023,"--No, no."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,558.578,570.052,"--Well, as a practical matter, I think that where you have no factual basis whatsoever and where a plaintiff is able to so allege, that will be sufficient to allow the plaintiff to go forward even under our legal standard."
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,570.052,573.69,"The person did have the opinion about the diplodocus, it was his opinion."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,584.879,585.481,And as I--
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,585.481,587.848,"A registration statement, you ought to have looked into it."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,587.848,594.603,"--And as I indicated earlier, Justice Breyer, I'm really not aware of any cases that involve that precise fact pattern."
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.419,597.038,I'm sure there are none involving the diplodocus.
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,597.471,601.923,--Or any other case where the speaker has no factual basis for the statement.
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,601.923,602.39,"--Well, don't say no."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,620.987,638.346,"And as a practical matter, Justice Breyer, I really do think that our legal standard takes care of that situation because in a situation where the plaintiff is able to make that allegation -- and I would note parenthetically that the plaintiffs certainly haven't made that allegation here -- it would likely be sufficient to surmount the pleading for--"
2014.13-435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,638.346,638.762,"Well, Mr. Shanmugam, suppose--"
2014.13-435,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.762,638.996,Do you think that--
2014.13-435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,638.996,640.012,Justice Scalia.
2014.13-435,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.012,646.6,--Do you think there's a difference between a factual basis and a reasonable factual basis?
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,653.356,657.324,"--Well, I think that really depends on what the reasonable basis stated in the standard actually means."
2014.13-435,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.324,661.292,"I mean, I think it's -- it's just the same rule in -- in disguise really."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,661.292,671.317,"Well, I think that in the context of legal compliance, if statements of the sort that we have at issue here, I think that that that context in many ways illustrates the potential difference."
2014.13-435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.568,712.476,"I think Justice Scalia is right there, and there would be something like that, but -- and so your point is a -- is a good point, that it isn't so easy to figure this out exactly what the standard is."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,738.976,740.895,"Well, I would say this, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.219,769.664,"You say that about Bankshares, which contains the statement that the Government refers to; conclusory opinions in a commercial context are reasonably understood to rest on a factual basis that justifies them as accurate."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,769.664,771.08,--Yes.
2014.13-435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,821.593,853.712,"If we adopt your position, which I take it to be that the lack of reasonable basis for a statement can be evidence that the belief was not sincerely held, in this case do we still have to remand or did I understand you to say that the plaintiffs below did not specifically allege that there was no reasonable basis at all for the statement?"
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,853.712,854.23,So two things.
2014.13-435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.732,898.843,"Mr. Shanmugam, I thought that the complaint alleged that the defendants had no 3 that no defendant had a reasonable ground to believe that Omni shares arrangements were lawful."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,898.843,901.378,"--Yes, and that was going to be my second point, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-435,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,978.126,987.315,"If the test is subjective as you claim, with respect to the issuer, whose subjective state of mind should -- must the Court look at?"
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,996.088,1005.194,"So I think that the inquiry would be much the same as the inquiry with regard to claims that have a scienter requirement, such as claims under Section 10(b)."
2014.13-435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1020.472,1035.648,"--Mr. Shanmugam, suppose that in a particular registration statement there was a statement that said a particular kind of transaction was lawful, all right, and the person who makes that statement, whoever it is, really believes it."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1070.905,1088.532,"So we don't think that there is an omission under that circumstance because we think that the only fact that is being disclosed by the statement is the fact of the speaker's belief, and if you look at the relevant language on which respondents and the Government really focus, it is that language concerning omissions."
2014.13-435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1110.713,1113.498,"Well, it just says statements therein."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1116.534,1134.311,"--I think that's most naturally a reference back to the language a couple volumes earlier about statements of material fact, and I think this all just underscores the fact that Congress in this provision did not impose a broad affirmative duty to speak, nor did it impose liability on untrue or misleading statements."
2014.13-435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1134.311,1146.553,"Well, it didn't it didn't impose an obligation to speak, but once you speak, it said that you're that you can't make omissions that make your speech your statements misleading."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1172.62,1179.107,"Well, in your hypothetical, Justice Kagan, you know, I think -- there are two points I would make about it."
2014.13-435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1209.11,1224.736,"But don't you think a reasonable reader would look at that statement and say two things actually: Both, he's done something to try to check as to whether the transaction is legal, and he doesn't know anything that's very dispositive going the other way."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1229.473,1247.769,"--I think where a speaker says nothing about the basis for the opinion, there are obviously a spectrum of potential bases for the opinion that the speaker could have, and so, again, we don't think that there is any necessary implication about the scope of the basis for the opinion."
2014.13-435,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1316.246,1321.733,"But I don't think, Mr. Shanmugam, that the fact that the statue has is a strict liability statute might cut the other way."
2014.13-435,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1334.207,1346.867,"Well, Congress dealt with the context of registration statements precisely by relaxing the other elements of liability that of course exist under other provisions of the securities laws."
2014.13-435,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1396.967,1398.183,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1402.019,1404.204,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1494.896,1503.402,"The Sixth Circuit held that once a false statement has been made, a defendant's knowledge is not relevant to a strict liability claim."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1504.069,1512.592,It is true with respect to the factual representations that are expressed or implied.
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1551.399,1557.903,"Since that's the holding of the Sixth Circuit, don't we at a minimum have an obligation to vacate and remand?"
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1564.307,1567.842,"--Well, Your Honor, the judge -- as a purely technical matter, I think that's not correct."
2014.13-435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1584.201,1598.877,"But assuming they're wrong about this, they said the Section 11 does not require a plaintiff to plead a defendant's state of mind, and a statement of opinion is actionable when it is ultimately found to be false."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1667.021,1674.961,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, you have described what the Government has articulated as the rule, and that is the reasonable basis standard."
2014.13-435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1710.182,1713.467,That doesn't make much sense to me.
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1718.102,1718.602,Yes.
2014.13-435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1718.602,1721.97,So how can you rely on evidence of what happened later?
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1730.24,1736.31,"Fair enough, and that is, Justice Breyer's hypothetical happened to be about what would happen in the future, and that would--"
2014.13-435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.31,1736.56,No--
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1736.56,1744.08,Should I give you a hypothetical that I think will avoid your problem but still raise the hard case for us?
2014.13-435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.917,1781.117,"No, no, I don't see how that could be."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1802.864,1816.023,"--This is a problem that the common law confronted, and it's addressed in the restatement first of contracts and of torts in 474 of the Restatement of Contracts and in 542 of the Restatement of Torts."
2014.13-435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.61,1853.043,Okay.
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1854.21,1854.776,Okay.
2014.13-435,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1871.422,1876.056,"Mr. Goldstein, can I just clarify what seems to be your point."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1905.576,1906.195,--Two things.
2014.13-435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1930.71,1931.86,Isn't that exactly what you have here?
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1969.501,1970.118,--Right.
2014.13-435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1970.118,1971.853,--with this and it could go the other way.
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1971.853,1973.553,I think this is a really important point.
2014.13-435,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2141.625,2143.661,"Could I just make sure I understand, Mr. Goldstein?"
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2169.792,2171.827,That is not quite correct.
2014.13-435,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2233.402,2242.005,"Well, there in that case of Virginia Banks, it was a given, it was stipulated or proven already by the jury verdict that they didn't believe what they said."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2242.005,2245.04,And I think that's a really important thing about Virginia Bankshares.
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2393.37,2397.255,"Well, if it's not purely subjective, if it's the reasonable basis test, what does that mean?"
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2404.51,2409.395,"Well, this is something that the common law has employed and utilized for well over a hundred years."
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2429.058,2434.362,But to what degree must the person let's just take the CEO who signs on behalf of the corporation.
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2441.366,2449.622,"--If you are making if you go out of your way to say what we're doing is legal, then you're going to have to undertake a reasonable investigation."
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2451.322,2451.907,"Well, what does that mean?"
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2451.907,2452.524,--It means--
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2452.524,2458.428,"Now, I believe it's I belive the CES says, I believe that nobody in this company is paying bribes."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2458.428,2458.728,--Yes.
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2458.728,2469.967,"And the CEO says no one from it's a true statement of belief, and he's received information from certain corporate compliance officers that no bribes are being paid."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2469.967,2470.402,Yes.
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2470.402,2474.704,"How much investigation does he have to go on, does he have to do?"
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2482.376,2484.11,It depends on whether he has information.
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2517.381,2518.233,"Well, I understand that."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2526.32,2537.194,"--Right, and the middle ground is that when he makes that statement in the registration statement, he is trying to induce me to believe, at the very least, I wouldn't say this if I didn't have a reasonable basis."
2014.13-435,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2550.768,2551.318,But you're not really helping me.
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2557.608,2559.841,"--I'm sorry, it's just very context-dependent."
2014.13-435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2589.577,2602.653,"Yeah, well, that's your your case, but I gather your answer to Justice Alito is that the CEO doesn't know about anything, and his lawyer comes in and says, Nope, I don't know about anything, then that cannot be the basis for a suit?"
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2602.653,2609.641,"In your hypothetical in which there is no question about the reasonableness, I think that they will have an excellent--"
2014.13-435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2609.641,2612.259,"No, I'm asking you, is it reasonable for--"
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2612.259,2612.693,--Yes.
2014.13-435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2612.693,2615.21,"--him to say, I don't know anything about any bribes."
2014.13-435,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2622.966,2627.851,"If that is true across the company, because it's not just the CEO that signs the registration statement, then yes."
2014.13-435,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2627.851,2628.953,Okay.
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2644.963,2646.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-435,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2703.399,2713.772,"Well, it seem it seems to me that you're not in the middle, that you're almost 90 percent with the respondent because you if very little weight to the subjective belief component."
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2713.772,2719.676,--We think that the you could establish liability either way.
2014.13-435,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2732.719,2737.138,But you I I are you disavowing Virginia Bankers?
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2752.313,2758.301,"--Well, with respect, we don't think that the court in Virginia Bankshares held that both were required because as you pointed out before the jury--"
2014.13-435,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2758.301,2758.553,"No, you're right."
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2771.627,2772.027,--That's right.
2014.13-435,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2776.947,2777.231,How do we--
2014.13-435,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2777.231,2782.116,"You were asking, in Justice Kennedy's, you said it was right and wrong, and then you got the part out about it being right."
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2783.901,2798.994,"--The way in which the Sixth Circuit decision was wrong is because it suggested this idea of liability by hindsight, that if there is something that you give an opinion on about legality and it's later proven or later later established to be false by a untrue by a court, that you could be found liable by hindsight, and we think that's not true."
2014.13-435,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2834.851,2841.571,But this is always going to come up after it's been shown that the statement turned out the statement of belief turned out to be incorrect.
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2862.168,2866.72,"Well, with respect, I'm not sure that that's true because of the stringent pleading standards that are in place."
2014.13-435,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2902.312,2913.351,"They say, someone pleads that they said we believe there were no bribes paid, and then later it's discovered that lots of bribes were being paid off someplace."
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2925.625,2928.127,"--Well, again, I think it depends on the case."
2014.13-435,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2952.575,2955.777,Do you think that there are specific omissions in this case?
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2955.777,2976.541,"Well, the case wasn't really pleaded the way that we conceive of it in terms of the lack of a reasonable basis, so we do think the appropriate thing for the Court to do would be to provide appropriate instructions to the lower courts, send this case back, and potentially allow this case to be repleaded because of the fact that we do think there was a kernel of this lack of reasonable basis idea in two places in the complaint in this case."
2014.13-435,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3008.412,3015.833,"Well, do you think that Twombly in this in this context requires the plaintiff to allege what kind of investigation was conducted before there is discovery?"
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3015.833,3026.974,"I think that that would be a case-specific determination, but I don't think that that under Twombly and Iqbal, that the that the plaintiff could just come in and give a very generic, a very conclusory allegation."
2014.13-435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3054.791,3071.085,"Well, why wouldn't they just say, Look, the statement turned out to be false, we don't doubt that he did hold that opinion as his opinion, he was sincere, but he had no basis for that whatsoever, period."
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3075.973,3083.06,"--Well, I think the plaintiff has the burden to to allege specific omitted facts that should have been given in the registration--"
2014.13-435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3083.06,3083.943,He never looked into it.
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3094.551,3100.022,"--Well, I think it depends in the context of the entire complaint, whether there's sufficient factual matter there or not."
2014.13-435,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3133.993,3136.445,Why can't that be submitted to the jury?
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3147.92,3149.153,"Well, Congress made--"
2014.13-435,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3149.153,3160.727,"If someone comes in, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, and there's no basis at all and says, “ I believe that this ”, and the evidence shows he had no basis at all, a jury can easily determine, we don't think he really believed it."
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3160.727,3163.262,--You're right that that's probative evidence.
2014.13-435,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3189.644,3192.078,"Ms. Saharsky, does this affect not only the private right of action?"
2014.13-435,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3209.04,3209.656,Yes.
2014.13-435,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3249.149,3249.966,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-435,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3252.234,3255.02,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-435,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3330.835,3339.524,"But there might be omitted facts, such as I didn't check with any of my lawyers, or I checked with my lawyers and they told me the opposite."
2014.13-435,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3347.78,3363.04,"--And so the only point I would add is the point that I think I made in my opening argument, which is that the statement of material fact here is still the statement of the opinion, and there is nothing misleading about that statement as to that stated fact."
2014.13-435,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3369.796,3389.023,"But I think what Ms. Saharsky is saying, maybe not Mr. Goldstein, is that there's another part of the statute which is omissions, and that those omissions of facts I didn't check with anybody or I checked with everybody and they said the exact opposite that's the thing that makes my own statement misleading, and that's why it fits within the statute."
2014.13-435,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3389.023,3391.825,"--Right, but it still has to be an omission that is, in the words of the statute,"
2014.13-435,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3642.667,3651.838,What would be your position if those qualifying statements that do appear just before and just after the belief statement were omitted?
2014.13-435,3,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3651.838,3665.163,"--Well, our view would be the same in the sense that we certainly think that subjective disbelief would still be required, and of course we believe that that is the holding of this Court's decision in Virginia Bankshares as it has been understood."
2014.13-435,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3679.823,3680.673,"Thank you, counsel."
