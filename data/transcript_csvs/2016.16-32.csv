2016.16-32,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.69,"We'll hear argument today in Case 16-32, Kindred Nursing Centers v. Clark. Mr. Pincus."
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,7.69,35.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To determine whether a power of attorney confers authority to enter into an arbitration agreement, Kentucky applies the rule different and more demanding than the rule for determining whether a power of attorney confers authority to enter into contracts generally. The question in this case is whether the Federal Arbitration Act precludes Kentucky from erecting the special obstacle to enforce arbitration agreements signed by an attorney-in-fact."
2016.16-32,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,47.45,72.06,"Suppose Kentucky had a statute providing that an attorney-in-fact lacks authority to do a -- a -- a number of things: Convey real property, move the principal's residence out of state, invest in foreign real estate, a few more examples like that, or sign an arbitration clause -- arbitration contract."
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,84.115,85.93,"At some point they can, Your Honor."
2016.16-32,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,168.205,181.8,"So how about a different example, but more related in my mind right now. Under Kentucky law, let's say, the power of attorney requirements are strictly construed."
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,205.55,262.33,"Well, let me distinguish between those -- those two general principles, Your Honor, if I may. I think a principle of strict construction, fairly applied across a wide category of contracts probably is something; in other words, if it applied to all powers of attorney probably is something that would pass muster under the FAA, again, recognizing that a court would have to take care that that notwithstanding the general rule, there wasn't some discrimination-in-fact against arbitration. I think the question about a fundamental rights line, let me answer that in two ways. First of all, in this case, we don't believe that that's in fact what happened because we think there are a number of fundamental rights that are not categorized in the group that the State court mentioned. And, in fact, what the State court did was identify four or five especially onerous examples of intrusion on fundamental rights and say they -- these are all like arbitration."
2016.16-32,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,319.59,350.695,"What about if the category were fundamental rights that implicate the -- the individual's life or health, so that you would have to have an express provision giving the attorney-in-fact authorization to consent to various procedures that a terminally ill person might undergo, and if this were put in that category?"
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,350.695,355.49,"Well, I -- I -- I just want to make sure I understand your hypothetical, Your Honor."
2016.16-32,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,355.49,383.95,"Well, in this case, what's involved here is care for a -- a person who is unable to look after that -- that person's own care, an elderly person, a disabled person in a -- in a nursing facility. So what if that were lumped together with consent to surgery, consent to terminate feeding, or -- or breathing for a terminally-ill patient."
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,389.274,391.33,They could.
2016.16-32,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.55,434.93,"Well, in Justice Alito's example, just to take it a little further, suppose the nursing home said you cannot enter here unless you sign the arbitration agreement, and this is the -- this is the only place where this person can go for care."
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,443.38,463.38,"Well, interestingly, what the -- the Kentucky court held in another case, Ping, that -- that actually a -- the power to make health decisions would be interpreted to include the power to enter into an arbitration agreement if arbitration were a condition of admission."
2016.16-32,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,507.2,507.43,But the --
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,507.43,508.86,"Again, not in this case."
2016.16-32,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,508.86,514.25,But the context here seems different from the arbitration cases that we've had in recent years.
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,584.705,588.47,"Well, respectfully, I don't -- I don't think so, Your Honor."
2016.16-32,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.03,660.655,What do you do with the argument that this doesn't have to do with the enforcement of an arbitration agreement? It goes to the question of whether the agreement was ever formed or made.
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,674.65,691.565,"Well, two answers, Your Honor. I -- I -- I think it does go to enforcement because really the question here is what the Kentucky court said: We are interpreting the power of attorney document in a way that renders the arbitration agreement unenforceable."
2016.16-32,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,736.57,740.11,"Well, what about the Wellner -- the Wellner documents."
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,757.32,768.945,"I think Wellner is closer to the -- to the issue that the court confronted in Imburgia, whether that really was an ordinary contract interpretation."
2016.16-32,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,797.805,814.77,"Well, do you think every time a State court incorrectly interprets a power of attorney relating to -- as it relates to arbitration, that that raises an FAA preemption issue?"
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,814.77,824.275,"I think the question is whether the State court's decision fails to put an arbitration agreement on an equal footing, as the -- as the Court has said."
2016.16-32,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,865.38,865.86,Mr. --
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,865.86,867.255,-- bringing Federal lawsuits.
2016.16-32,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,867.255,887.5,"Following up on Justice Alito's question, and I know Ping is not before us, but applying your arguments to Ping, because the author of Ping dissented in these two cases, do you think Ping is closer to the neutral application of a contract interpretation?"
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,887.5,907.13,"I do, because the -- what the court relied on in Ping was the absence of any general authority to contract and the fact that the broader -- all -- what Ping provided for was the ability to -- to invest funds, the ability to make health decisions, and -- and the ability to essentially administer real property."
2016.16-32,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,913.1,913.47,I see --
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,913.47,915.11,"There was some -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2016.16-32,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,915.11,915.23,"No, no."
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,917.665,918.53,Wellner is --
2016.16-32,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,918.53,919.1,But it seems to me that --
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,919.1,926.02,The difference in Wellner is that Wellner does have a very broad clause that provides for the making of contracts with respect to personal property.
2016.16-32,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,964.33,965.03,That's a pretty powerful --
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,965.03,965.83,-- explaining what's going on.
2016.16-32,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,965.83,973.995,That's a pretty weak argument that they've automatically made a special rule for arbitration.
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,998.925,1014.015,"Well, let me take a little bit of issue with -- with your -- with the predicate of your question, because the Wellner power does say to make, execute, deliver deeds, releases, conveyances, and contracts of every nature in relation to both real and personal property."
2016.16-32,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1019.495,1035.59,"And, Mr. Pincus, may I ask you a question about the wrongful death action, which everyone agrees does not belong to the patient; it belongs to -- to the survivors."
2016.16-32,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1067.29,1072.715,"I guess that, in the first instance, would be a question of Kentucky law, Your Honor."
2016.16-32,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1172.435,1180.205,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Salyer."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1180.205,1205.04,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Kentucky is a common law State in the development of its power of attorney interpretive law. It is not a uniform power of attorney act State. Therefore, over time, the Kentucky Supreme Court and the lower courts of Kentucky developed Kentucky's interpretive rules regarding powers of attorney case by case, again, over time."
2016.16-32,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1223.87,1233.039,Is -- is there such an explicit reference in the power of attorney with respect to anything other than arbitration agreements?
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1233.039,1235.79,Is -- is there anything?
2016.16-32,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.79,1263.81,"Is there an explicit reference -- to be effective, you've just told us, the power of attorney has to explicitly state the -- that disputes will be settled by an arbitration. My question is whether there is any other contract that in order to be made effectively in Kentucky, it must be an explicit reference in the power of attorney."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1263.81,1295.25,"Oh, I -- I understand your -- your question, Justice Ginsburg. From -- this is the announcing of this particular rule, but logically, from here on out, any such actions taken by an -- a -- an attorney-in-fact that might restrict the principal's free speech rights, say, by entering into a contract with a non-disparagement clause or some sort of confidentiality clause, that would necessarily have to be spelled out in a power of attorney."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1295.25,1295.79,In other words --
2016.16-32,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.79,1307.79,"In other words -- in other words, for a number of years Kentucky had allowed powers of attorney and the first time that one was called into question under this theory was with reference to the arbitration."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1307.79,1312.21,"Well, Your Honor, here -- here's the thing about Kentucky powers of attorney."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1369.79,1381.775,"So in Kentucky, I issue a power of attorney to Jones and say, you have full power to protect, defend and maximize the value of all my property."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1383.52,1384.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1384.98,1395.66,And someone claims that this piece of land over here that we thought belonged to Smith belongs to him under various deeds.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1396.645,1397.68,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.68,1404.454,"Now, the -- the attorney says, in my opinion, I want this tried before a judge because I think I'll get a fairer shake."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1407.25,1409.98,"Are you making the distinction, Your Honor, between --"
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1409.98,1416.775,"Well, you just said anything that waives the right to a jury is illegal unless it's explicitly there."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1437.31,1438.05,"No, Your Honor."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1438.4,1439.28,"Oh, that's not right."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1455.8,1456.68,"Well, Your Honor --"
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.68,1468.435,"So what's the difference between that and the case we have, where we're not going to have a mediator, we're not going to have settlement, we're not going to have a judge trial, we're going to have an arbitrator."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1468.435,1477.645,"Your Honor, the -- the interpretive rule that the Kentucky Supreme Court enunciated was the power to waive generally fundamental constitutional rights."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1487.72,1496.91,"All he did was say that in the attorney's judgment, if he wants to go to arbitration and thinks that's best, he can do it."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1549.33,1550.15,"Well, Your Honor --"
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1550.15,1551.84,Unless you can find some difference.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1551.84,1570.66,It seems to me that the analogue to what you're -- you're proposing would be an instance where the -- the attorney engaged with another party never to have a jury trial with that party pre-dispute just for a -- for from now on.
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1574.13,1575.635,"No, that isn't this."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1644.055,1676.855,"Thank you, Your Honor. I -- I think that the -- the -- the distinction that -- that would be made there is that we're -- we're talking about an agreement that's pre-dispute and waives a -- this particular right vis-à-vis the nursing home resident and the nursing home potentially in perpetuity. And I guess the analogue to -- to a -- coming to an agreement to settle pre-dispute would be a liquidated damages clause."
2016.16-32,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1740.24,1742.785,And maybe I missed your -- missed your point.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1746.73,1750.26,Agreements to -- beyond agreements to arbitrate and --
2016.16-32,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1750.26,1761.72,"Interpret -- interpreting them or anything with respect to them? For example, you're not arguing that if Kentucky had a law saying you can't have agreements to arbitrate, that would certainly be covered by the FAA."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1761.72,1765.82,"Yes, Your Honor, that -- that -- well, we believe, would be covered by the FAA."
2016.16-32,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.82,1772.895,"So -- and if that was a decision of a court that said, under our common law you can't have agreements to arbitrate, that would also?"
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1772.895,1773.66,Totally not.
2016.16-32,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.675,1786.18,"Well, since we're talking about laws that have an impact on agreements to arbitrate, I guess I don't understand the effect of your principle."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1786.18,1799.47,"Well, we're looking at the black letter of Section 2, which provides that agreements to arbitrate shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract."
2016.16-32,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1799.47,1800.335,Right.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1800.335,1805.035,That pertains specifically to arbitration agreements.
2016.16-32,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1870.24,1886.265,"So -- and your reasoning, I take it, that Kentucky could adopt a law that says agents lack authority to enter into arbitration on behalf of the principal."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,1886.265,1889.92,"Well, technically, Your Honor, that's correct."
2016.16-32,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2080.29,2083.705,Can I talk about -- focus a little bit on -- on Wellner.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2095.52,2114.84,"Well, the -- my response to that, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the Kentucky Supreme Court certainly engaged in trying to understand the intentions of the words that the principals meant."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2301.3,2306.44,"We give the power of attorney to manage my patent, general."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2330.515,2335.13,"Your Honor, Mr. Justice Breyer, I think that's correct."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.13,2343.18,Can't -- can't give a power -- general power of attorney that will allow a person to settle a patent case on perfectly ordinary terms.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2343.18,2344.92,"Well, it doesn't make a difference --"
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.92,2349.925,"Is there any case that suggests that -- except this case, which happens to deal with arbitration."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2349.925,2351.57,"Well, it does have to --"
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2351.57,2367.31,"You see, I don't know how to -- the part I don't know how to deal with your argument is, is you say every time I think of examples that would be very weird, which is what I'm trying to do, then -- then you say, oh, well, yeah, that's right. You can't do that anymore in Kentucky."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2380.385,2385.4,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the interpretive rule is -- is rather explicit."
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2385.4,2393.155,Now -- now we say that you cannot enter into a power of attorney giving the power of attorney the power to enter into normal patent settlements.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2393.155,2394.24,To --
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.24,2406.53,"Well, what about business settlements? What about business settlements where, you know, there is a perfectly normal thing where a person agrees not to compete, and in agreeing not to compete, you're agreeing not to go to certain places?"
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2406.53,2407.06,Well --
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.06,2411.43,"For that business anyway, a lot of constitutional rights that might infringe."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2413.995,2419.99,"Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, that -- again, that's a -- that's a question of what constitutes a fundamental -- constitute --"
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2419.99,2420.07,Yeah.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2420.07,2421.705,-- fundamental constitutional right.
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.39,2425.025,What do you say about the competing product?
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2425.025,2426.14,Right.
2016.16-32,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.76,2438.41,"Right, right."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2488.09,2522.66,"Well, Your Honor, if I could use a -- a comparative example from the -- the UCC, we know that in ongoing transactions between commercial parties under the UCC, whether a -- a contract clause is incorporated into the contract, if and when it is incorporated, may turn on whether or not that clause is considered material. Now, whether or not it's -- it's considered material is a question of State law."
2016.16-32,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.04,2615.175,But what about the principle that making an arbitration agreement harder to form than other agreements violates the Federal Arbitration Act.
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2644.06,2674.41,"Perhaps it does, Your Honor. But, again, our -- our position is that the Federal Arbitration Act does not extend beyond agreements to arbitrate, such that in the -- the instance of the -- the UCC example that I just used where a State decision as to whether or not arbitration clauses are considered material might make that -- might make it harder to form the arbitration agreement as part of the larger commercial contract."
2016.16-32,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2755.255,2775.73,"Well, you say you're distinguishing formation from enforcement, but we have two separate agreements that both been formed the power of attorney that's been concluded, the agent has signed the arbitration agreement."
2016.16-32,1,62814,robert_e_salyer,,2787.15,2788.69,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.16-32,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2911.48,2916.155,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have ten minutes."
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2916.155,2970.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a couple of quick points. With respect to the -- the question about whether the FAA is limited to arbitration agreements, I think it's important to note that the text of the FAA says that arbitration agreements shall be valid irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. So it's true the focus of the FAA is on whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable or not, but there's nothing in the FAA that prohibits its application to an antecedent agreement if that antecedent agreement prohibits the enforcement of the arbitration agreement on a ground that's specific to arbitration. And I think that's not only true of the text of the statutes; it's true because the implications of that rule would be quite dramatic."
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2991.14,2992.41,"Now, the State could also --"
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2992.41,2992.6,-- that would --
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2992.6,3000.38,The State could also enact a statute that says powers of attorney can't waive -- can't waive fundamental rights.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3004.115,3008.24,I -- I think it would present a more difficult question than this case.
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3028.635,3028.79,Yeah.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3037.34,3040.195,"Well, I think the question would be just how inclusive is it."
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3043.92,3055.42,"It -- it says it embodies the rule that the supreme -- Kentucky Supreme Court adopted, which is that you can't -- you can't waive fundamental rights, and like a lot of statutes, it's going to require some interpretation."
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3065.56,3080.33,And -- and I -- I -- I think our answer to that question would be -- although the Court doesn't have to reach it here -- that lumping arbitration agreements into that category of fundamental rights is a judgment that the FAA precludes the State from making because the judgment --
2016.16-32,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3080.33,3102.045,"But that -- that suggests that the arbitration is a preferred right, and I thought that the idea of the FAA was to say it can't be -- whatever, dis-preferred, un-preferred, you know -- but not to put it on its own separate plane, like you can't deal with this in the same way that you could deal with any other fundamental right."
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3102.045,3128.45,"Well, that's why I say it would be a harder question, Your Honor, but -- but I think the -- the critical thing is here, it's quite clear from the State court's own opinion that that isn't the rule of decision here because the State court, as the dissent points out, the -- the express authorization requirement doesn't apply to jury waivers in a host of different circumstances, as Justice Breyer's opinions pointed out, and it also doesn't apply to lots of fundamental -- other kinds of fundamental rights."
2016.16-32,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3128.45,3138.025,But how do we really know? Are -- are you saying that a court can never announce a generally applicable rule first in an arbitration case?
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3138.025,3142.67,"Well, I think it -- it certainly is something that should raise a lot of suspicion."
2016.16-32,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3167.94,3168.71,"Suppose -- well, suppose --"
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3168.71,3172.03,"-- expressly says, the question is how broad is it singling out."
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3172.03,3174.78,It doesn't single out arbitration.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3205.78,3210.97,I -- I think it -- it depends on the circumstances and it depends on -- on how badly --
2016.16-32,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3210.97,3216.36,Suppose -- suppose we send this back and we say we don't really believe you.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3246.715,3249.1,"Well, I -- I guess a couple of things."
2016.16-32,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3262.08,3263.54,"Well, I know, but I want --"
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3263.54,3264.07,-- premised on --
2016.16-32,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3264.07,3295.72,"-- what I want to hear you talk about, usually we don't presume that State courts are acting in ways that are not in accordance with law. Actually, we usually give them the benefit of a kind of good faith presumption. So if you're saying, well, no, they have to prove it first in five other cases before we'll believe them that they really do mean all constitutional rights, that seems, you know, an unusual rule to apply to State supreme courts who we usually think are acting in good faith and in accordance with law."
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3295.72,3298.35,"Well, I don't -- I don't know that they have to prove it."
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3319.35,3319.76,So you --
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3319.76,3321.465,-- onerous -- I'm sorry.
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3321.465,3323.33,You have to look at what's going on in the case.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3330.97,3338.43,I -- I think the question in that case would not be whether it's going to be applied to the category of fundamental rights.
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3349.62,3351.16,There's no talk about arbitration.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3351.87,3352.49,"No, I understand --"
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.49,3353.02,-- doesn't come up.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3353.02,3354.72,"-- but -- but there still is a question, I think."
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.6,3372.87,We understand that. But I'm talking about a legislative proposition.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3381.3,3383.98,I -- I think it would be a much harder case.
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3384.83,3396.775,"Well, I know, but the problem is -- is that it is, in terms of the law-making authority, Kentucky would say to the supreme court, you know, we make these rules through the courts as we did in this case."
2016.16-32,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3410.52,3415.12,So isn't it that -- that your answer is there's nothing wrong with that statute?
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3415.12,3416.3,"Well, I think -- I think --"
2016.16-32,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3416.3,3440.16,"And that, in fact, what the statutes does, whether it covers arbitration or not, if a court holds that it does cover arbitration, you have to look to see whether the other things in there are like arbitration sufficiently or there are other things that aren't covered that are like arbitration sufficiently, so that you could, at the end, draw a conclusion that this is or is not discriminatory."
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3440.16,3441.9,There's nothing else in there.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3443.1,3443.62,That's exactly --
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.62,3448.25,"The first time the statute is applied, it happens to be to an arbitration case."
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3454.18,3457.27,"Well, I -- I -- I guess two answers."
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3467.64,3474.16,"Mr. Pincus, you understand that when your first answer is, let's go to this case, that's not the most compelling response."
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3474.16,3499.16,"I understand, Your Honor, but -- but I -- I -- and to answer the question more broadly, I -- I do think there's a -- there's a question that the Court would have to answer in that circumstance, whether, as Justice Breyer put it more eloquently than I did, that the -- that arbitration is being included in that category not because of some special characteristic of arbitration, but because arbitration agreements have the same characteristics as all of those other things --"
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3499.16,3499.33,All right.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3512.405,3532.115,"Well, and -- I would say, as an advocate at least, that the problem with that judgment is that what Congress said in the FAA is, in fact, you can't say that arbitration agreements should be treated like some special category of contracts just because of a characteristic of arbitration."
2016.16-32,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3555.73,3584.3,"If -- so the -- as I -- as I understand the question better, one, of course the legislature could enact such a statute. Two, if we have our first case arbitration and they say arbitration is included among it, then what we're job is is to read the opinion. Now, sometimes courts don't write enough in the opinion for us to make the decision as to whether or not it is being discriminated against, in which case we send it back and ask them to write more."
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3586.72,3589.45,"Yes or no, and your time is expired."
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3589.45,3590.76,No. (Laughter.)
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3590.76,3592.225,I think you have enough here.
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3592.225,3592.52,No.
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3594.0,3604.66,"I -- I think the answer is no because I -- I think there's enough in this opinion. I -- I think for the reasons indicated in Justice Breyer's question, the -- the category here doesn't apply to all jury waivers."
2016.16-32,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3613.89,3614.1,He cheated --
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3614.1,3616.43,-- of contracts you can imagine. (Laughter.)
2016.16-32,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3616.43,3616.955,Sorry.
2016.16-32,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3616.955,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
