1999.99-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.882,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-244, Mobil Oil Exploration and Producing v. United States, Marathon Oil Company v. United States."
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,17.173,35.46,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a contract case in which my clients have paid more than $156 million for the right, as it said in... at Pet."
1999.99-244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.23,164.834,"Mr. Phillips, may I ask, this is a case with some complex provisions, and is it the case that under the lease the Government had the power at least to suspend the lease?"
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,164.834,179.034,"Well, it certainly had the power to suspend the lease under certain conditions in section 5 of the lease that said that if there is a threat of irreparable injury to the environment, irreparable and significant injury, there was certainly the opportunity to do that."
1999.99-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,202.068,203.1,I may not understand this.
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,249.456,250.859,"Right, and part of that's because--"
1999.99-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,250.859,253.831,"Now, is the suspension of the lease... did they have a right under this reg?"
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,268.237,284.296,"--My guess is that under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, if they had made the specific kinds of findings that are provided for in section 5, they could bring all of this to a halt, including their obligation under the 30-day requirement, but of course prior to the time--"
1999.99-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.296,285.865,But those findings are environmental findings?
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,285.865,287.556,"--Yes, under the--"
1999.99-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.556,288.465,Serious risk?
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,288.465,289.125,"--Serious harm, yes."
1999.99-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.125,293.129,"And contrary to that they had a 2,000-page report that said there wasn't one, isn't that--"
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,293.129,314.656,"They said there was no significant risk created as a consequence of that, and while the Government has made the effort in this Court to suggest that there's no materiality in this context because the Outer Banks Protection Act basically supplies the findings that could have otherwise been supplied under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, it is absolutely clear to me that that cannot be the case."
1999.99-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.777,375.196,"--Mr. Phillips, it seems to me there are some factual issues here."
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,393.689,394.72,Absolutely.
1999.99-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.72,400.021,--do you have to argue for some factual determination here different from that made by the claims court?
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,400.021,400.36,No.
1999.99-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.136,446.667,"But the Government says you waived the acceptance of the repudiation, if that's the right phrase, by continued performance."
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,450.903,457.674,"That was... one aspect of that was raised in the claims court, and the claims court I think viewed it as sufficiently insubstantial."
1999.99-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.908,528.467,Mr.--
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,528.467,530.696,We didn't even know if there was a breach of this contract--
1999.99-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.696,532.804,--Can I ask you one question?
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,546.3,547.786,--That case is still alive.
1999.99-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,547.786,559.94,"Now, the thing I want you to explain to me, and I'm sure you have an answer to this, if you filed that case seeking to protect your rights under the whole program, and if that's still pending, how can you simultaneously say that the whole deal is off?"
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,559.94,564.216,"Essentially for the reasons I was just explaining to you, Justice Stevens."
1999.99-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.326,579.737,But let me ask you this.
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,590.305,600.132,"Well, at that point we would be able to go to the plan of exploration, but we would still have... well, at this stage now the Outer Banks Protection Act has been repealed, but--"
1999.99-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,600.132,601.079,Is it not--
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,601.079,603.847,"--assuming the Outer Banks Protection Act was still in place, we would still have the same objection."
1999.99-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.847,612.43,"--I guess the ultimate question I'm trying to ask, is it not conceivable that you could lose this case and still develop the properties by winning that case and get your approvals later?"
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,612.43,630.718,"I mean, in reality, and if you're asking for a practical answer as opposed to a theoretical answer, as a practical answer, no, because all of the other leases surrounding us have all been turned in because all of the other leasehold owners had caved years ago, rather than try to litigate this matter, so that the Manteo Unit no longer exists as a unit."
1999.99-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.401,636.662,But you would have the legal right to develop it if you won that case?
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,636.662,643.161,"Well, we would have the legal right now to have the Secretary approve our plan of exploration."
1999.99-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.161,646.321,"And if they approved it, then you'd have the legal right to go out and drill the wells."
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,649.665,654.745,"Well, we would have to get... we would still have to get permits, and we would have to go through all of the approvals of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, that's true."
1999.99-244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,683.102,683.352,So--
1999.99-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.352,683.774,--Mr. Phillips--
1999.99-244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,683.774,698.213,"--is your answer, then, that by attempting to preserve your ability to perform, you do not foreclose yourself from seeking restitution when the other party has repudiated the contract?"
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,698.213,703.702,"--That is exactly our position, that in the ordinary course it's an election of remedies issue which comes much later in the process."
1999.99-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,712.618,741.597,"May I take you back to where Justice Stevens was, because you mentioned very quickly that there's a statute in this picture, the CZMA, and as far as I understand your argument, you are not in any way suggesting that the States couldn't... subject to the override of the Secretary of Commerce, the States couldn't say, even if you had every approval from Interior promptly, the State could still say, North Carolina could still say, no go, no exploration."
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,746.51,746.832,Right.
1999.99-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,776.975,778.954,"Here he didn't, at least in the first round."
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,781.266,783.784,"Did not in 1994, however."
1999.99-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.784,793.443,"--And there's one peculiar feature of this case that follows on to your answer that yes, North Carolina could do this subject to the override of the Secretary of Commerce."
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,807.811,808.57,Right.
1999.99-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.57,813.755,--you could get everything you wanted from Interior and North Carolina could still say no.
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,823.414,825.151,"No, seek restitution."
1999.99-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,825.151,826.015,--restitution.
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,826.015,827.501,There are two answers to that.
1999.99-244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,921.124,922.321,Is it part of--
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,922.321,923.436,--they would have preferred to be able to drill.
1999.99-244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,923.436,942.755,"--Is it part of your submission that had the POE been approved, you then would have been in a stronger legal position to insist upon obtaining permits, or of overruling the North... North Carolina's objections in a subsequent court action?"
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,944.324,945.523,I'm not sure if it--
1999.99-244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,945.523,946.842,"--I didn't see that in the briefs, and I--"
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,946.842,949.238,--I'm not sure it's so much in the subsequent court action.
1999.99-244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,973.674,977.845,"--Well, at least your legal position with the Secretary would have been enhanced but for what you allege to be the repudiation."
1999.99-244,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,977.845,978.688,--Yes.
1999.99-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.859,1035.346,"Very well, Mr. Phillips."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1036.377,1056.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At page 118 of the joint appendix, Mobil tells us that the leases involved in this case encompass what may be the largest hydrocarbon deposit discovered in the United States since the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska in the 1960's."
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.22,1093.675,That's okay.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1098.876,1099.908,Well--
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1099.908,1101.561,But the issue before us is whether they get their money back.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1101.561,1125.543,"--Well, that is an issue before us, and under the leases, under the terms of the leases that are applicable to us as well as to the lessee, the United States has the absolute right to suspend all operations on the lease, including consideration of these kinds of exploration plans, whenever the United States determines that there is a threatened harm to the environment, or that economic... I'm sorry, environmental studies--"
1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1125.543,1126.946,"Right, but his argument is that you've never determined it."
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.946,1128.886,You never made that determination.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1128.886,1132.601,"--Well, no... I'm sorry, but I disagree with both of those."
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.372,1140.199,I don't have that in your brief.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.199,1140.692,No--
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.692,1148.494,"--That is, what I have in my... in the statute is that it says, regulation... and here I gather there was no regulation."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1153.695,1153.945,--Yes.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1153.945,1162.201,"--if there is, and these are the key words, a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm to the environment, among other things."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1169.465,1170.292,I'm sorry--
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.292,1177.267,"I take it there is no regulation by the Secretary that says that, or that provides for... that makes that finding."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1177.267,1178.753,--You mean a finding by the Secretary.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1178.753,1179.124,No.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1180.073,1180.694,There is a regulation.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1180.694,1181.892,--But not that has a finding.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1181.892,1189.155,"There is a regulation that says we can suspend whenever... to do an environmental study, or to investigate threatened environmental harms."
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.155,1190.454,That... I'm sorry.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1190.454,1191.218,That's what the regulation says.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.218,1191.961,That--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1191.961,1198.815,"What the OBPA, what Congress found in enacting the OBPA was that there were both threatened environmental harms--"
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.815,1212.85,"--Why don't you say... let me pose a question, though I may not do it perfectly, then you'll see what... I thought the statute says there has to be a regulation, and it says if there is a threat of serious, irreparable or immediate harm."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1231.88,1232.457,--There's--
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1232.457,1240.259,"--My question is, it doesn't sound to me like a finding that it would be a reasonable thing to do to have the suspension."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1247.484,1248.144,--If you--
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.144,1248.765,"Now, that's my question."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1248.765,1249.425,--Okay.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.404,1261.769,These were in the statute?
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1261.769,1264.369,--They're part of the Outer Banks Protection Act.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.633,1273.946,"Where are you... what page are you reading from, Mr.--"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1273.946,1275.636,--159a of the Marathon petition.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1275.636,1276.008,--Yes.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1277.372,1279.519,159a.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1279.519,1280.466,15... thank you.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1280.466,1283.688,The petition number is 99-253.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.32,1299.868,That isn't the same finding as the statute calls for.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1299.868,1303.583,"--It is, because what the statute... and that's the confusion that I need to clear up."
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1338.219,1338.962,Where... where--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1338.962,1340.159,--environmental determination.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1340.159,1341.395,--Where are you reading from?
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1341.934,1344.367,Page 102a of the Marathon petition--
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1344.367,1344.906,--Yes.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1344.906,1347.628,"--appendix, at the bottom, item--"
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.628,1348.621,Human environment?
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1348.621,1349.652,--Human environment.
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.324,1418.754,But the need to make further investigation does not equate with a finding of immediate or serious danger.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1418.754,1420.983,"--Well, there was a--"
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1420.983,1423.584,"That's what you have to get to, and I keep listening for--"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1423.584,1424.866,--Immediate or serious.
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.866,1425.526,--where that finding is.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1425.526,1435.64,"Yes, immediate or serious, and one of... and what I quoted to you from the findings of the OBPA says that a major industry is subject to potentially significant disruption."
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1435.64,1440.219,"You tell me where you discuss that in your brief, because I didn't... I didn't really have that one."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1446.247,1447.445,"Well, we only--"
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1447.445,1448.271,--totally not up to speed--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1448.271,1448.931,--Right.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1448.931,1449.59,--on what you just read me.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1451.365,1453.883,I can't... I'm not sure that we discussed that finding in the brief.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.883,1457.969,"Well, if that... if that finding is so obvious, then why didn't you discuss it in your brief?"

1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.127,1530.499,Okay.

1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1600.14,1606.0,"This issue, the effect of development on the human environment, was in the statute, OCSLA."

1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1664.7,1665.239,I'm saying it--
1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1665.239,1665.982,--because it was unauthorized?
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1665.982,1668.332,"--Well, it's not binding."

1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1754.236,1756.465,--That was not the Government's position.
1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1765.67,1768.271,And you're saying it may not be considered as evidence for any purpose.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1770.417,1771.986,--Certainly not... it is certainly incorrect.
1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1800.965,1803.732,"Sure it can, but it can't amend the terms of the lease."

1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1904.496,1905.444,That's--
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.444,1907.673,--and I take it that it's also... yes.

1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1912.465,1913.784,We did.

1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1914.527,1916.218,--in our brief.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.218,1925.135,"--the key point I think, if I'm right, is that was there a finding of a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm, and now we're back where we started, is that right?"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1925.135,1936.38,"I hope not, because I hope that it is as apparent on your further review of this material as it was to me that that's exactly what Congress said it was concerned about."
1999.99-244,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1949.162,1961.051,"Before we leave this point, is it your position that, had Congress made this finding at the... as you call it, at the time the lease was negotiated, that it's quite likely the oil companies still would have entered the lease?"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1961.051,1969.346,"--I have... I... the only... yes, because all that Congress said is, make a realistic review of these environmental issues."
1999.99-244,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1970.339,1973.311,"No, but you earlier said that it's a finding that absolutely forecloses--"

1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.253,2093.143,"--Well, I mean, you know, true, time is normally not of the essence, but that phrase means, you know, if you're 1-minute late it's no big deal."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2101.318,2101.689,I--
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.689,2112.092,"Reasonable time is of the essence, and if you have not approved these operations within the reasonable time that the contract envisioned, it seems to me you're in breach of the contract."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2112.092,2128.15,"--Like all other issues of materiality, ultimately you're looking at a question that requires you to look at all the facts and circumstances, and my point is simply that the facts and circumstances of this lease are plainly that these kinds of suspensions are contemplated."
1999.99-244,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2132.321,2132.98,"Well, it was--"
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.98,2145.157,"--Known that Congress is going to pass a new statute making a finding that under the contract is supposed to be made by an executive official which could be reviewed by a court, as I assume a congressional finding cannot be?"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2145.157,2151.927,--I don't understand that... Congress in the OBPA didn't usurp authority from the Secretary of the Interior.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.015,2182.326,"Well, the claims court judge... I'm reading from 71a... it said, clearly the old... he said, clearly the OBPA imposed severe, burdensome new conditions upon the Department of Interior's obligations under OCSLA to approve POE's offshore North Carolina."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2184.417,2184.91,Yes.
1999.99-244,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2206.458,2207.201,Are you saying that--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2207.201,2207.861,--supervisory.
1999.99-244,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2207.861,2228.666,"--if we had nothing but the outer continental shelf, that the Secretary, who was on the verge of giving approval to beginning exploration, on the verge of that when the second act passed, that the Secretary was out of compliance with the Outer Continental Shelf Act at the time the next act intervened?"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2230.607,2240.638,"Well, I'm saying that Congress had a justifiable concern about the inadequacy of the environmental, including human environmental analyses that had been conducted thus far."
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.269,2254.384,What did it buy?
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2268.38,2269.245,"Well, that's the question."
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.245,2269.445,Yes.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2274.901,2275.439,"I mean, that's--"
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.439,2275.932,--but we'll take a risk.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2275.932,2276.654,--That's the question.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2278.244,2279.154,"No... oh, well--"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2279.154,2280.473,--and the answer is no--
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.473,2280.845,--I--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2280.845,2285.47,--because the Secretary had not yet been in the position to make the determination that he was required to make.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.47,2289.351,"--Obviously, if that's so you're going to win on those grounds, et cetera, if all that's relevant."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2291.952,2292.612,Okay.
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.612,2301.24,"I'd say on that question, what are they buying if they're not at least buying a promise that, look at this law."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2319.528,2332.364,"Well, that, of course, is an assumption that I can't follow along on your hypothetical with, because plainly there was no compliance with the OCSLA ultimately, and I think, however, the answer--"
1999.99-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.364,2334.101,Did they buy the promise?
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2342.562,2350.736,"--I think that what they probably bought was a right to pursue the procedures that are established in order for them to obtain this and that, of course, is where we are."
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.033,2421.529,"Mr. Jones, you're essentially saying that these savvy businessmen bought a commitment from the Government that was dependent upon not just a finding by some expert board, or by some Secretary, but that was ultimately dependent upon whatever finding Congress... that, you know--"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2421.529,2422.439,"--No, I'm not saying that."
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.439,2424.751,--that scientifically precise body--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2424.751,2425.161,Again--
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2425.161,2426.98,--was likely to make in the future?
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2426.98,2429.431,"--Again, what we're deciding is that what--"
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.431,2429.991,This is a crazy contract--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2429.991,2430.613,"--No, it's not--"
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.613,2435.935,"--if they really said, so long as Congress thinks further study should be done, further studies will be done, and that's what we're buying."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2435.935,2441.22,--Congress simply said that there's enough information for it to conclude that further studies need to be done.
1999.99-244,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2444.109,2444.83,"Well, but Congress--"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2444.83,2445.473,All--
1999.99-244,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2445.473,2450.136,--in the act also suspended everything for an indefinite period of time.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2452.737,2464.542,"--It is... I think it might be a reasonable time, because what Congress actually suspended... it was until the Secretary could certify that he had the information required to make the findings that he needed to make under the OCSLA."
1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2568.901,2570.137,"That I... no, please."
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.137,2574.306,I'm just not aware of the principle of contract law you're appealing to.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2583.883,2585.452,You can press the--

1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2592.139,2593.792,--The key difference is that they didn't just press.
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.455,2599.032,What performance--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2599.032,2599.57,--They--
1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.57,2600.313,--from the Government?
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2600.313,2609.518,--They obtained... the United States spent 2 years doing the environmental reviews that were needed to put it in the position to determine whether to approve the exploration plans.

1999.99-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2616.334,2616.744,That's not the performance under the contract.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2616.744,2619.882,--That was the additional performance by the United States.

1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2661.781,2663.35,"--Well, what you're describing as--"
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2663.35,2664.299,--come back and say the contract is at an end.
1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2664.299,2667.354,--imperfect performance as I understand it is the suspension of the lease payment.

1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2690.676,2691.874,To do what it had to do--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2691.874,2692.617,--To do what it--
1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2692.617,2694.27,--presumably to perform its side of the contract.
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2694.27,2694.846,--That's my--

1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2715.651,2719.616,"Well, in every frustration case it's going to be an answer to rescission to say, gee, I tried."

1999.99-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2726.221,2727.418,And that's a benefit to--
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2727.418,2729.314,"--It's not that they're losing a remedy, Justice Souter."
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.282,2743.432,"--Well, but you can get rescission lots of times when you can't get damages, just when there's an early repudiation."
1999.99-244,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2743.432,2743.782,--Yes.
1999.99-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.805,2802.92,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."

1999.99-244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.592,2872.598,"Well, but I take it his argument, which I really didn't understand till I heard it... now I think his argument... I don't blame him for this, but I think his argument--"
1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2872.598,2872.97,"I might, but--"
1999.99-244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2872.97,2873.63,--is the following.
1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2887.087,2887.542,--Right.
1999.99-244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.542,2888.74,Now look at the reg.
1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2888.74,2889.566,Right.
1999.99-244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2889.566,2900.091,And what the reg says is that there shall be... the regulations shall provide for suspension if there is a threat of serious harm to the environment.

1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2924.118,2924.611,--Right.
1999.99-244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.271,2926.097,"--But anyway, that's his argument."
1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2926.097,2928.615,"And it's subject essentially, I think, to three answers."
1999.99-244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.76,2949.586,"Well, whatever about the case--"
1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2949.586,2951.443,--to future statutory change and regulation change.
1999.99-244,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2951.443,2959.329,"--Whatever about the case... whatever the case said, why isn't this a finding... maybe it was in the brief, too."
1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2967.047,2977.162,"Well, in part because the definition... and we, of course, have not had an opportunity to brief what it means to be in the human environment, but recall finding number 3 is tourism."

1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3090.308,3097.906,"Well, I think it's not uncommon in some of these cases to have Interior and Commerce disagree about the right way to proceed."
1999.99-244,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3099.513,3112.888,"But why would Congress assign the supervising role, the control role to Interior under the Outer Continental Shelf Act, and then under the CZMA give the control to the Commerce Department?"
1999.99-244,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3112.888,3129.689,"Justice Ginsburg, I think the theory there is that there may be instances in which the Secretary of Interior might be too wedded to environmental concerns, and that there are other commercial issues that are of greater importance, and in the appropriate balance... which is what he's supposed to do, because he's supposed to analyze it independently--"
1999.99-244,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3129.689,3131.464,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
