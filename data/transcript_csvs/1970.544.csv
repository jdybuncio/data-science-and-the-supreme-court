1970.544,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.284,We’ll hear arguments next in number 544 Commissioner of Internal Revenue against Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
1970.544,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,35.27,38.281,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,173.834,176.299,Does is it have to be one or the other?
1970.544,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,176.299,177.463,"No, Mr. Justice."
1970.544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.463,182.284,Either an ordinary and necessary business expense or a capital expenditure?
1970.544,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,189.594,192.144,"Mr. Justice, let me deal first with the capital expenditure --"
1970.544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.144,197.691,"Then, we don’t have to decide this case, but I wondered if those are the only two possible facts."
1970.544,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,197.691,200.304,The term cap -- let me start with capital expenditure.
1970.544,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.208,210.339,And it doesn’t fit that definition.
1970.544,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,210.339,230.244,"Right, but that issue has been dealt with explicitly by Mr. Justice Blackmun, when he sat on the Eighth Circuit in a case called General Bancshares Corporation, which is not cited in either of the briefs, but was cited below and which is reported at 326 F.2d."
1970.544,1,15477,adam_y_bennion,,1515.269,1519.741,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.544,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.611,1808.832,"Mr. Bennion, are you then making an ad hoc approach to the taxpayers concerned?"
1970.544,1,15477,adam_y_bennion,,1827.84,1831.136,"That’s true, Your Honor, because there would be no payment due."
1970.544,1,15477,adam_y_bennion,,1856.183,1863.618,"Let me carry on one more, what then is the statutory purpose in setting out both 404 (b) and 404 (d)?"
1970.544,1,15477,adam_y_bennion,,1866.806,1879.409,"This will have to be my own personal opinion, because I cannot climb into the minds of Congress, but I think it was primarily a device to bring about fairness."
1970.544,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2013.812,2027.238,"As I understood as you say, and as I understand the law, Section 404 (d) payments are to be made only by institutions, whose deposits are increasing."
1970.544,1,15477,adam_y_bennion,,2027.238,2027.792,That’s correct.
1970.544,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.792,2031.383,"If they're not increasing, there are no 404 (d) payments to be made."
1970.544,1,15477,adam_y_bennion,,2031.383,2035.369,That’s correct.
1970.544,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2900.35,2903.552,"Yes, thank you Mr. Chief Justice."
