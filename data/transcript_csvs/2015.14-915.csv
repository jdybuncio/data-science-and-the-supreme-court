2015.14-915,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.665,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 14-915, Friedrichs v. The California Teachers Association, et al. Mr. Carvin."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,9.665,22.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Every year, Petitioners are required to provide significant support to a group that advocates an ideological viewpoint which they oppose and do not wish to subsidize."
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,37.36,48.89,"Mr. Carvin, is it permissible, in your view, to allow the union to be the exclusive representative so that nobody else is at the bargaining table?"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,48.89,50.48,"Yes, that's fine with us."
2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,99.5,105.925,"Mr. Carvin, is -- is it okay to force somebody to contribute to a cause that he does believe in?"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,105.925,109.57,"I wouldn't think, Your Honor, that you could force Republicans to give contributions."
2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.57,109.73,Yes.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,122.955,123.42,No.
2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.42,124.31,Is that okay?
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,124.31,131.72,"No, it's not, and that's because the bedrock principle, as Harris made clear, is not whether or not you vividly oppose what they're saying --"
2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,131.72,132.17,Right.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,132.17,134.66,-- it's because you don't wish to subsidize it.
2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.66,135.13,Exactly.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,141.4,141.75,No.
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.52,164.905,"If -- if you were to prevail, what would happen with private employers in a State which said that there should be an -- a union shop?"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,164.905,166.315,"Nothing, Your Honor."
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.315,166.6,What --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,166.6,167.16,For two --
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,167.16,168.52,And -- and because?
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,168.52,179.63,"Because the First Amendment doesn't apply to private employers, and because in Beck the Court established the rules for agency shops based on the statute without any First Amendment --"
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.63,181.65,I think that's correct as a basic distinction.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,198.77,210.56,"Well, I don't, in candor, think that that would create State action under the Court's modern jurisprudence, such as Moose Lodge, where it turns on who is making the decision that is being objected to."
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.165,234.47,What about the Railway Labor --
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,234.47,234.955,What is the --
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.955,237.065,What about the Railway Labor Act?
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,237.065,237.99,I apologize.
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,237.99,239.235,The Railway Labor Act.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,239.235,239.87,Yes.
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.87,247.82,"You -- you answered Justice Kennedy that, in the private sector, this -- this is all right, you can have an agency shop."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,250.44,265.89,"Well, as you know from Street, you can have agency shops but the agency fees can only go to things that are germane to collective bargaining. In other words, they impose the Abood rule in the private sector as a matter of statutory interpretation, and nothing the Court says about --"
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.89,273.27,"But you don't have any First Amendment argument about that, about the -- either the private sector or railroads."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,273.27,274.28,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,283.82,335.28,"Well, one of the points of your public employee cases generally, Mr. Carvin, is essentially to ensure that when the government acts as an employer, that the government be put in the same position as a private employer; in other words, that the various constraints that would constrain the government when it's acting as sovereign fall away and a different and lesser set of constraints apply that are meant essentially to ensure that the government doesn't use its position as leverage over things it oughtn't to be able to control, but that the government can do the same things that a private employer can. And so why doesn't this fall within that category of things? In other words, you've just said private employer can decide to do this."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,339.555,356.985,"For two reasons, Justice Kagan. First, I must respectfully disagree with the premise. None of the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence quite says public employers have the same rights as private employers. Private employers under the Constitution can discriminate on the basis of political affiliation. They can even discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation."
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,369.115,370.5,"As I said, Mr. Carvin --"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,370.5,370.62,Sorry.
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,370.62,372.81,But there's a lesser set of constraints.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,395.845,418.48,"The Court's government-as-employer speech and First Amendment draw a clear distinction between restricting employee speech, like under the Pickering line of cases where there is deferential review, and circumstances such as this where they do leverage the employment relationship to coerce the employee to subsidize or associate with an outside group. That's obviously --"
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,418.48,419.09,How is that different --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,419.09,427.01,"-- for example, Rutan is subject to strict scrutiny because they are leveraging the employment relationship to force you to associate with a political party."
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,427.01,427.67,"Well, that sounds --"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,427.67,428.105,Similarly --
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,428.105,432.4,-- like you're drawing a distinction between restricting speech and subsidizing speech.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,443.53,443.95,Yes.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,541.5,568.98,"Well, why are we treating the government differently than a private employer? You just earlier said, and I think our -- our cases are replete with the point that as employer, the government can already restrict speech which is, I think, a higher problem than subsidization. We've already permitted subsidization of bar associations, of government programs."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,584.6,585.33,No.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,585.33,586.14,Oh --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,586.14,586.61,I'm sorry.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,586.61,588.72,"-- I -- I beg to differ. Hold on, Mr. Carvin."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,589.975,590.72,Sure.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,590.72,638.515,"It says, ""When recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative, a union assumes an official position in the operational structure of a school."" So it seems to me that -- and California tells the union what topics it can negotiate on, it requires them to do training, and in the end it accepts their recommendations with respect to -- to the issues of employment at its own will, meaning the State is creating the union as part of the employment training and other responsibilities."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,638.515,642.94,"Justice Sotomayor, I think it's important to draw a distinction between having an official position -- they certainly do."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,654.41,656.42,"Oh, in fact, it might be able to do that."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,656.42,657.19,I don't --
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,657.19,664.5,If it -- it tells them what they can -- they give -- the State legislature has given them the right to do that.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,664.5,665.17,Right.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,665.17,672.85,"But what would take away from their right to say, no, you can't bargain on these particular topics?"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,672.85,673.81,The First Amendment.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,681.45,682.365,Absolutely.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,682.365,684.44,"Well -- well, then, that's my point."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,694.085,706.415,"Well, they wouldn't say, don't advocate this with respect to the State legislature, but they could say that's not going to be the subject of discussion at the bargaining table. Those are two different things altogether."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,706.415,709.53,"Well, again, we need to distinguish between collective bargaining and lobbying."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,709.53,710.51,Exactly.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,710.51,711.07,Exactly.
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.0,728.62,"Well, even -- even with --"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,728.62,729.08,What --
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,729.08,738.24,-- even -- aren't charges -- suppose the union has an article or a public relations campaign to protest merit pay.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,740.82,742.285,"Yes, under Lehnert."
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,743.09,760.985,So -- so collective bargaining in -- in this instance subsumes -- includes this wide-ranging effort on the part of the union to have a public relations campaign in favor of principles that some of its members -- that some teachers strongly object to.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,760.985,762.14,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,811.78,811.96,If we --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,811.96,820.61,"So the distinction is between what public officials have to meet and negotiate on, but that doesn't translate into any ability to tell the union what to say or do."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,821.02,821.72,In terms of --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,821.72,823.795,-- the Respondents will agreed with that.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,823.795,825.58,But the teachers can lobby.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,828.535,830.7,And that's the whole point. The teachers can lobby.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,832.22,832.42,Uh-huh.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,833.75,839.2,"Just like the union can. And yet, they can't be forced to subsidize the union's lobbying --"
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,839.2,840.53,But what does your lobbying do --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,840.53,844.215,"However -- so with respect to collective bargaining, they can't negotiate."
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,863.16,865.92,"Mr. Carvin, you come here, of course, with a heavy burden."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,890.435,893.0,"There are two special justifications, Justice Kagan."
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,910.27,910.83,You say this a lot in your --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,910.83,911.57,The second --
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,911.57,912.02,Excuse me.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,912.02,912.13,Sure.
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,912.13,913.79,You say this a lot in your briefs.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,936.035,941.58,"But -- but you are asking what -- if the Court concludes that Abood was erroneous, what special justification is there?"
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,941.58,941.77,Yes.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,952.23,952.57,Right.
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,952.57,964.37,"I guess I'm saying that I find that an extremely difficult concept to understand. It would take away stare decisis effect from numerous -- I mean, just hundreds, thousands of our decisions."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,964.37,966.77,"But Justice Kagan, with respect, I think the proof is in the pudding."
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,971.17,974.29,"And you think all the Fourth Amendment cases, in your opinion, are correct."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1002.96,1003.4,That --
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.4,1008.95,There should be no rule that stops any incidents from coming in.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1024.49,1025.47,"No, no."
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1037.62,1037.8,"Well, wait."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1055.11,1071.05,"If the Court was convinced that capital punishment was clearly outlawed by the Constitution, I think it would be very strange to tell people who were being executed in the future that even though this is an unconstitutional execution, we are bound by our erroneous prior decisions."
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1071.05,1076.75,"Well, Mr. Carvin, let's -- let's -- let's assume that stare decisis is an important consideration for the Court."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1078.015,1078.74,Sure.
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1078.74,1092.08,"What about the answer to Justice Kagan's questions about the many contracts, perhaps thousands of contracts? Would they suddenly be endangered? Would they all be void? Could you address that?"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1092.08,1099.73,"There is no reliance interest. These contracts will operate precisely the same, the day after Abood is overruled, as they would before."
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1099.73,1101.06,But what would happen then?
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1101.06,1101.32,Sorry.
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1101.32,1107.415,What would happen to the employee who said now Abood is off the books?
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1107.415,1107.66,Right.
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.66,1113.65,I want back the agency fee that I was compelled to pay.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1125.055,1125.74,When you --
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.74,1127.28,-- have a right to get it back?
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1127.28,1127.93,No.
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1159.32,1159.85,"Well, Mr. Carvin --"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1159.85,1159.97,Do you --
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1159.97,1175.63,"-- remember, one, you're assuming that these provisions are completely severable, which I imagine depends on the contract. But number two, even suppose that they are severable, these provisions are bargained for benefits. The contracts would read differently."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1194.355,1194.75,No.
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1206.76,1207.64,The unions have --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1207.64,1208.53,-- but they're not -- sorry.
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1208.53,1218.59,-- for -- for -- for -- many ways of dealing with their need for adequate funding in order to perform their collective responsibilities -- collective bargaining responsibilities.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1231.5,1237.08,"Well again, they didn't negotiate with the employer for funding because they don't get any funding from the employer; they get it from their members."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1242.58,1250.93,"Ah, but that's the question, isn't it? Would it be illegal for the government, as employer or government, to fund the union?"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1250.93,1253.54,"That's a -- I thought about that, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1273.59,1294.505,"So if the union had a way, or something to negotiate, which was right now, the union participates in the grievance procedure and it pays certain expenses for that, it could have said to the employer, we're no longer getting enough money to be the exclusive representative of every employee --"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1294.505,1295.06,Right.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1295.06,1298.01,-- so now we want you to fund certain things.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1298.01,1298.38,Well --
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1298.38,1301.5,That could very well have been part of the negotiation.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1301.5,1303.29,"Not in California, for two reasons."

2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1312.39,1312.51,Prior --
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1312.51,1314.99,I'm not assuming the state of the law as it exists now.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1322.775,1323.415,Right.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1323.415,1326.445,All right? California's going to have to respond somehow.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1330.255,1330.86,It's --
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1330.86,1334.435,They're going to have to come to some sort of accommodation.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1334.435,1334.76,Right.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1337.49,1342.055,"Even if they did, could they then decide to fund the union?"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1342.055,1342.64,Oh.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.725,1343.86,Well --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1343.86,1348.56,"If -- if they wanted to go ahead and fund the union, as I said, they've got some discretion to do it."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1357.93,1358.68,Let's -- let's take that aside.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1361.83,1362.79,"Oh, okay."
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1370.07,1370.38,Mm-hmm.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1370.38,1373.29,"I think they might be able to, but of course no State --"
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1373.29,1373.45,All right.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1386.065,1386.39,Right.
2015.14-915,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1397.4,1398.61,I'm a little --
2015.14-915,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1398.61,1413.17,"Is there any history in American labor management relations, at least going back, I don't know what, 75, 80 years of employers paying for unions? I thought the union movement was against this long ago."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1413.17,1415.82,Your -- your recollection of history is correct.
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1422.255,1424.62,"There -- there were company unions, but regardless --"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1424.62,1424.88,But --
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1424.88,1426.28,-- I'd like two minutes to --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1426.28,1426.84,But if I --
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.84,1427.91,"Sir, go ahead."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1428.98,1429.6,Before you --
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.6,1429.82,Finish.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1430.43,1440.16,"Just one more sentence. Under the NLRA, it's a felony for the employer to give the unions money because it would influence the unions, and contrary to the entire structure of collective bargaining."
2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.16,1441.74,Is it a bargainable subject?
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1441.74,1442.21,Excuse me --
2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.21,1445.49,"Is it a bargainable subject? I mean, it's a political subject."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1454.72,1482.295,"It doesn't exist, it's never existed in American society, and there's no way the public employer, particularly because agency fees as a matter of statute, could all of a sudden say, sure, we're going to take our taxpayer dollars and start giving money to unions, because they've always been funded through voluntary contributions. If they did become recipients of Federal or State funds, that would impose all kinds of restrictions on their speech and other activities that the unions presumably would never have asked for wholly apart from any funding shortfall."
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.295,1491.095,"I have a different -- somewhat different subject, but it -- and I don't know how to get you to focus on this exactly."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1539.46,1540.03,It certainly is.
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1540.03,1566.46,"And so -- so what is it, in your mind, that you can say from the point of view of this Court's role in this society in that if, of course, we can overrule a compromise that was worked out over 40 years and has lasted reasonably well -- not perfectly. I guess people could overrule our decisions just as easily."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1584.525,1585.04,Justice Breyer --
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1585.04,1597.61,"And you -- you start overruling things, what happens to the country thinking of us as a kind of stability in -- in a world that is tough because it changes a lot."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1597.61,1601.31,And I think you put your finger on precisely the same question.
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1685.905,1686.67,Mr. Carvin --
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1686.67,1689.575,-- because everyone recognizes there's some First Amendment protection.
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1689.575,1702.3,"I mean, it seems to me -- I guess we have one disagreement, which is how well Abood fits with all of our other employee speech cases, because I think Abood fits pretty well."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1790.75,1792.28,"Again, I must respectfully disagree."
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.83,1831.43,"Well, I -- I --"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1831.43,1832.275,This doesn't -- this --
2015.14-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.275,1833.99,I'll accept that.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1931.17,1931.44,Sure.
2015.14-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1971.73,1977.89,"Mr. Carvin, do I take it -- it was something that Justice Breyer said; you didn't respond directly to it."
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1991.58,1992.12,"Well, no."
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2004.85,2005.4,Those cases --

2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2015.775,2018.69,"A lot of cases cite cases, but the question is --"
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2018.69,2019.25,It's not a cite.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2023.455,2025.42,"Again, I must respectfully disagree."
2015.14-915,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2051.67,2054.81,Bar associations do things all the time that lawyers disagree with.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2067.98,2077.52,"Keller struck down those kinds of activities by bar associations, taking positions on Federal jurisdiction, taking position on gun control. It said they could only spend money --"

2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.85,2114.69,I think that we're talking about two kinds of bar associations.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2115.78,2115.81,Oh --
2015.14-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.81,2127.15,-- associations get into a lot of those other things. You're -- you're just saying that those bar associations that you're compelled to join as a condition of your practice do not get into those things.
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2127.15,2128.28,"Oh, absolutely."
2015.14-915,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2136.52,2153.16,"Mr. Carvin -- Mr. -- Mr. Carvin, I see -- I see your -- I -- I -- I see your -- your time is running. Could you address briefly the opt-in/opt-out requirement, an issue which, I take it, is in the case, regardless of -- of -- of the -- the way we rule on the issue we've been discussing?"
2015.14-915,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,2153.16,2154.4,"It -- it certainly is, Your Honor."

But the State also has critical interests in being free to manage the public workplace, much like a private employer, unless we are improperly leveraging the employment role to coerce or suppress citizens' speech. So let me try to briefly address why I think, if we are going to have collective bargaining in the public sector, mandatory agency fees can serve important State interests without unduly burdening citizens' speech."
2015.14-915,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2253.51,2254.44,Before you get --

2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.51,2306.89,But it's not --
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2306.89,2308.26,-- we can't take it over. Excuse me.
2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2308.26,2308.42,No.
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2309.225,2317.665,"Well, which is why it's very important that we not fund it directly, and that we not be perceived as controlling the speech of that representative."
2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2317.665,2335.975,"It's -- it's hard to visualize this in a pure employer-employee relationship, when the collective bargaining agreement, itself, has to be submitted for public review and public comment. That -- that suggests that you're doing more than simply regulating the employment relationship."
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2335.975,2342.36,"Well, the public employment context is certainly different from the private context, and that's one of the important ways."

2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2374.93,2384.91,"If your employees have shown overwhelmingly that they want collective bargaining, then it seems to me the free-rider concern that's been raised is -- is really insignificant."
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2384.91,2387.22,"With respect, I disagree with that."
2015.14-915,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2437.32,2439.495,But it's -- it's almost axiomatic.
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2512.025,2543.63,"And let me -- what I'd like to do is to separate out the important public policy issues, which we do not deny cross-cut between the public's fear and the -- the realm of citizens' speech and the -- the isolated collective bargaining realm. They -- they do cross-cut, but that -- that does not mean that the two spheres are the same. So in the collective bargaining context, what the employer needs is to get one agreement with one group of employees, which we do by having one union. It's a democratic process."
2015.14-915,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2585.07,2607.72,"Do union -- do unions have public relations programs of -- or newspaper articles, media programs to talk about things like merit pay, protecting underperforming teachers and so forth?

2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2607.72,2609.89,The union is engaged in a variety of speech.
2015.14-915,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.4,2614.72,Some of the ones I've mentioned are chargeable?
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2614.72,2616.39,I believe under current law they are.
2015.14-915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.42,2631.63,"Well, if it --"

2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2685.11,2685.17,Why?

2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.08,2710.714,"If you disagree with that, what is -- what is your best example of something that is negotiated over in a collective bargaining agreement with a public employer that does not present a public policy question?"
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2710.714,2715.085,Mileage reimbursement rates or how you're going to have public safety.
2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2715.085,2716.435,It's all money. That's money.
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2732.97,2754.16,"Which is why I would say I would not try to draw the line by saying that some part of this speech is not a matter of public concern or whatever term you want to use. What I would say is that they -- when we're trying to run the public workplace, we need to have some flexibility because for -- as employers, we're trying to reach workable agreements to govern particular workplaces for particular periods of time."
2015.14-915,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2764.87,2793.895,"Where does the -- where does the State of California think the line should be drawn? A provision of California law -- this is Section 3546(b) of the -- of the California Government Code -- says that agency fees may be used for, quote, ""the cost of lobbying activities designed to secure advantages in wages, hours, and other conditions of employment, in addition to those secured through meeting and negotiating with the employer."" Is that constitutional?"
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2793.895,2796.31,I don't know the answer to that question.
2015.14-915,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2813.91,2818.79,"Well, one of the questions is whether the -- whether Abood is workable."
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2826.015,2831.6,I think there are arguments about why that kind of thing could be considered germane to bargaining.

2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2871.87,2873.65,"Well, we have -- I'm trying to sort out."
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2886.1,2890.76,I don't think there's necessarily any fundamental disagreement.
2015.14-915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.55,2960.64,"General DuMont, you -- you are arguing that -- and I sympathize with -- with the need of the State to have an efficient system for dealing with its employees, and I can agree that dealing with just one union makes everybody's life easier. Why do you think that the union would not survive without these -- these fees charged to nonmembers of the union? Federal employee unions do -- do not charge agency fees to nonmembers, and they seem to survive; indeed, they prosper."
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2964.01,2966.16,The Federal situation is different.

2015.14-915,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2989.44,2996.08,"Because you -- you've pointed out the membership is low in the Federal sector. But there is no bargaining about pay, right?"
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2996.08,2998.81,There is no bargaining about pay; that's correct.
2015.14-915,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2998.81,3005.38,"General, there was no fact-finding below on this assumption, factual assumption of whether --"

2015.14-915,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3007.065,3015.74,"No factual development. So there's a presumption in the question posed which is that it can survive, but we don't know that factually."
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3015.74,3021.07,"We don't know that factually. The State would prefer not to take that risk, and I don't think the Constitution requires us --"
2015.14-915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.07,3022.81,You're the one making the argument.

2015.14-915,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3037.45,3038.99,You have a compelling interest.
2015.14-915,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3038.99,3044.55,"With respect, Your Honor, I don't believe that what we need to show is that the union would not survive without this."
2015.14-915,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3072.04,3085.97,"It's odd to say that if X is required to pay $500 for someone to espouse a belief that he doesn't share, that he is now free to go out and -- and argue against it."

2015.14-915,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3106.73,3115.28,The whole idea of Southworth was a public forum. Are you saying that the whole purpose of agency fees is to have an open public forum?

2015.14-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3127.04,3133.895,"Thank you, General. Mr. Frederick."
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3133.895,3150.21,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Abood correctly held that States may reasonably insist that nonmembers pay their share of costs for the services provided by a union to the government and to all employees as their exclusive representative."
2015.14-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3223.55,3228.04,"Well, I suppose, if that's so convincing, the union can convince teachers to join the union."
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3228.04,3243.41,"Well -- and, in fact, in California, the overwhelming majority of the teachers are in the union, and it's only a small percentage that have opted not to. But I would go further, Justice Kennedy, in saying that what we are talking about here are a range of services that they're providing."
2015.14-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3277.6,3283.99,"But -- but -- but philosophically, if you use Pickering in this case, you're committing error of composition."
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3297.43,3318.015,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think that it is fair to suppose that the government, in deciding whether it's going to establish a relationship with its workers and were to get input, is necessarily going to be dealt with a cacophony of views unless it comes up with a reasonable system of management to get those views collected and have them represented by an exclusive representative."
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.69,3395.415,"And all of that would still survive if the Petitioners prevail, unless your basic argument that if you do away with agency's -- agency fees, the unions are going to collapse and not be in a position to negotiate those safety requirements."

2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3432.24,3432.88,That's right.

2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3489.445,3489.72,Sure.
2015.14-915,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3489.72,3491.79,"I think it's important, and I'd like you to explain it."

2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3526.34,3536.045,Because it enables all of the workers to know they are making a shared sacrifice for the purpose of working together to establish a coherent position with their employer.
2015.14-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3536.64,3538.83,"You say that, but I -- it doesn't mean anything to me."

2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3552.28,3552.45,Well --
2015.14-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3552.45,3558.01,-- what the city is willing to -- to give in collective bargaining and whether you have agency fees.
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3558.01,3566.57,"Justice Scalia, all I can report on in the absence of a factual record -- because this was basically brought as a facial challenge -- is what is in the amicus briefs."
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.65,3577.82,"Well, I --"

2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3582.01,3583.5,-- through the collective bargaining process.
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3583.5,3595.01,It sounds to me like your argument cuts exactly the opposite way. The -- the problem that's before us is whether or not individuals can be compelled to support political views that they disagree with.

2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3740.664,3748.54,"Well, Justice Breyer, I guess the question is, are you going to decide a case of this constitutional significance on the basis of a hypothesis based on --"
2015.14-915,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3748.54,3748.76,All right.

2015.14-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3761.17,3772.839,"Mr. Fredericks, we -- I suppose, Mr. Fredericks, we could assume that a State is always benefitted and -- and is more efficient if it can suppress speech."
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3772.839,3781.78,"And your decision in Garcetti, Justice Kennedy, allowed for the suppression of the speech by the prosecutor who objected --"
2015.14-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3781.78,3784.45,That was in the workplace. It doesn't apply to merit pay.
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3793.06,3796.18,Those are all classic workplace situations.

2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3832.315,3833.35,That's correct.
2015.14-915,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3834.1,3842.855,"And what burden do you have, or is it your adversary who has to show no reliance interests that the foundation is wrong, et cetera?"
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3842.855,3856.285,"We submit that, given the four-decade history, they have the burden to demonstrate that the way the system has worked would be unworkable if it were to be -- if it were to be sustained. And -- and Justice Kennedy, back to your point."

2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3883.715,3884.38,Well --
2015.14-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3884.38,3885.01,Big difference.
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3885.01,3886.64,-- their speech isn't silenced.
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3926.92,3933.095,"Mr. Frederick, your -- your -- I think you would at least agree we're dealing with some sensitive and important constitutional issues."
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3951.79,3968.9,"On the second question presented, we think that the decision ought to be affirmed because Abood correctly recognized that here, where there was basically no burden on the person who wanted to opt out, that that was in itself a core question."
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3968.9,3972.83,"And what you're saying, it's easy for the person to check a box saying I opt out."
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3975.505,3999.285,"It's administratively -- actually, in a system where the overwhelming majority -- and we're talking about more than 90 percent of the people are paying the fees, even those that are nonchargeable fees under the Lehnert line to support political activities, it's administratively much easier to count a smaller number. And the question is whether the suppression of their constitutional rights is such as to rise to the level of compulsion."
2015.14-915,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4018.41,4022.15,"Well, opt-in is -- opt-out is not always as easy as you -- as you say."
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,4038.025,4044.435,"Well, let me just say that the perpetual opt out is not an issue in this case."
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4073.485,4079.405,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.14-915,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,4079.405,4091.94,Thank you.
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4091.94,4095.195,General Verrilli.
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4095.195,4171.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin by summarizing the three fundamental reasons why Abood should be reaffirmed. First, in the four decades that Abood has been the law, this Court's jurisprudence in the area of -- of employment relations, First Amendment jurisprudence in the area of employment relations has converged with Abood in a way that fortifies its foundations and does not erode them, because what those cases have recognized is when the government is acting as employer managing the workforce, it should receive reasonableness review in order to give it the latitude comparable to that of a private employer to manage its workforce, and not exacting scrutiny that applies when government is a sovereign regulating the citizens. Second, in those four decades, more than 20 States have enacted and enforced laws that allow the public employers in those States to have the same latitude that Congress gave private employers to decide, based on workplace needs and local conditions, whether agency fee requirements will help them achieve the purposes for which they -- for which they adopt collective bargaining. And the reliance goes far deeper than those 20 State laws and the thousands of contracts affecting millions of people that are based on those laws."
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4316.48,4328.64,"The -- the fact that Abood has been around for 40 years, does it affect your point at all that the main justification for Abood that's being advanced today is one that Abood did not adopt?"
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4328.64,4336.505,"Pickering justification, that's what I hear most prominently in the presentations, and yet Abood did not even cite Pickering."
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4336.505,4340.97,I -- I respectfully disagree with that as a technical matter.
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4348.34,4354.41,"In -- in -- in terms of that, but in terms of the substantive analysis, it can't really seriously be called a Pickering case."
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4354.41,4354.82,No.
2015.14-915,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4378.52,4389.39,"Well, Pickering is -- Pickering is the heart of your argument, so I -- I do want to ask you a couple of questions about it. Is it different from the situation here in several respects? One was brought out."
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4423.8,4424.05,Let me take --
2015.14-915,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4424.05,4426.505,So as to the -- as to the latter --
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4426.505,4426.93,Yeah.
2015.14-915,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4426.93,4444.785,"-- there are circumstances, are there not, in which the Department of Justice could terminate or take an adverse employment action against a DOJ employee for something that that employee says as a citizen on a question of public concern."
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4446.38,4447.285,Yes.
2015.14-915,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4447.285,4454.37,Are there any circumstances in which the Department of Justice could compel an employee to make a statement --
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4454.37,4454.57,I can't --
2015.14-915,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4454.57,4454.66,-- as a --
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4454.66,4456.05,"I -- I can't think of one, specifically."
2015.14-915,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4456.05,4457.1,-- as a -- as a private citizen?
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4457.1,4485.685,"I can't think of one, but that goes right to the difference, right to the difference between government acting as employer, managing the workplace, and government acting as sovereign, regulating the citizenry. In the latter situation, what this Court's cases would say is that that is not government acting to manage the workplace; that is government leveraging its -- its control over the employee, acting as sovereign, affecting that person in his role as citizen, and that would get exacting scrutiny. And that -- so that -- I think that's the key."
2015.14-915,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4521.54,4534.85,"Well, I -- when -- when -- when a union is bargaining about a matter of -- of public concern, you're saying that that's -- that is not the same as commenting on a matter of public concern?"
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4534.85,4535.17,No.
2015.14-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4560.02,4562.37,All of that is true. Nobody -- nobody denies that.
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4595.3,4611.74,"But I guess what I would say about that, Justice Scalia, what I read this Court's cases as saying in the employee speech context, in the employee petitioning context, in the political affiliation context, is that you -- yes, it's not wholly free of First Amendment scrutiny."
2015.14-915,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4622.97,4644.605,"I guess -- isn't it -- is -- you may know -- the case in which government as employer is most likely to want to control what the employee says and where he has the right to do that is likely to be a case that involves the institution's job, i.e., the public interest."
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4644.605,4645.405,Yes.
2015.14-915,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4690.03,4697.185,"General, you seem -- and everybody seems to equate government subsidy with government speech."
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4708.565,4710.285,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4710.285,4710.86,Sure.
2015.14-915,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4710.86,4731.935,"What I would say about that, Justice Sotomayor, is that in this context, the subsidy goes to the process of contract formation and contract administration within that collective bargaining context that I described earlier, that of necessity, a different First Amendment standard has to apply to. Thank you."
2015.14-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4731.935,4735.28,"Thank you, General. Three minutes, Mr. Carvin."
2015.14-915,3,35611,michael_a_carvin,,4735.28,4760.27,"Thank -- thank you. As to the absence of a factual record here, it's important to point out that we gave them an amended answer where they could make any allegation they wanted. And at page 4 of their so-called opposition, it said, to quote, ""The unions do not oppose the entry of a judgment on the pleadings."" Why is that? Because they certainly -- it's their burden to argue, for example, that agency fees will lead to the demise of the union."
