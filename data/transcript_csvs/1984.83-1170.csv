1984.83-1170,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.946,We'll hear arguments next in United States against 50 Acres of Land.
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,63.122,67.525,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.016,593.1,"Mr. Schwartz, you say that in the case of sewers and water lines, fair market value simply doesn't exist."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,604.347,611.591,"--Well, our question... a value could be placed on it, but our... the problem is what would the right kind of testimony be?"
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.323,631.105,At least there haven't been any sales.
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,631.105,643.233,"--There haven't been any sales, there's no income from the property to capitalize, so that the... to say that a jury properly... a trier of fact properly instructed with the proper evidence is to beg the question."
1984.83-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.035,652.699,"Well, but you know, in cases where there are no comparable sales, you can go to sometimes to reproduction cost."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,655.261,657.852,"--Your Honor, I don't think I disagree with what you said."
1984.83-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.914,698.42,But why not say that is one form of fair market value rather than saying where fair market value can't be ascertained you resort to substitute facilities.
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,703.182,710.639,"--It's a fair value, and I don't... I think it's... I'm not sure it makes all that much difference."
1984.83-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.693,819.251,"Well, Mr. Schwartz, I guess there is language in our cases that something other than fair market value can be used in two instances: one, if you don't have a fair market value, which you have been discussing; or secondly, where it is manifestly unjust to the owner or the public to apply a fair market value principle."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,831.678,832.77,No.
1984.83-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.052,854.054,"Could, could a case like this, where you are taking a landfill, for example, or some other public facility that must be replaced, would it ever be appropriate to analyze it in terms of that manifestly unjust standard?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,855.654,874.979,"--Your Honor, I hesitate to say no, never, but I think the pertinent question that needs to be answered is why would it be... try to understand why it might be manifestly unjust in a particular case, and neither the Court of Appeals nor Respondent has explained why it might be manifestly unjust."
1984.83-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,878.78,906.818,"Well, okay, would it include the fact that inevitably this local government is going to have to acquire a substitute because it is under an obligation to dispose of trash and garbage; and secondly, because it is going to have to make a substantial additional expenditure to do it over and above acquiring the land, if those were the facts?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,906.818,920.385,"--We are not satisfied that either of those would establish the kind of manifest injustice, and I would like to... that the Court has in mind, to the best of my understanding, and I would like to explain why that is so."
1984.83-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1017.672,1020.932,"Well, it may have a more immediate necessity."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1038.794,1039.315,The homeowner has an equal--
1984.83-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1039.315,1042.167,The homeowner can go rent something temporarily.
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1055.346,1058.088,--It still seems to me that you need something else.
1984.83-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1122.86,1129.605,"Well, what if the cost of the substitute was significantly less?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1140.682,1145.584,"--We are aware of that, and in our brief we have made our choice."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.219,1243.151,"Well, how did the jury come in with $750,000?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1243.151,1246.863,"--The truth is, Your Honor, we don't have any way of knowing."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.494,1326.416,"Well, wouldn't the Court of Appeals adjustments take care of that?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1326.416,1330.727,"Well, that on... on that we have several difficulties."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.707,1335.03,"Well, wasn't it aimed at that?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1335.03,1337.602,--The Court of Appeals said that--
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1337.602,1345.256,"If the substitute facility is obviously twice as big, or lasts twice as long, I would suppose the adjustments would take care of that."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1345.256,1348.048,"--Well, there is some possibility of that."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.322,1384.202,But it did vacate the--
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1384.202,1396.871,"It did, but it placed us in quite a grey area, where we do not see... and the other... and of course, there is also the question of the Court of Appeals' other adjustment."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.936,1516.788,--Didn't you have a chance to put on your evidence?
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1521.993,1524.505,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.414,1528.438,You said you were the only evidence about that.
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1528.438,1544.979,"--We... the government presented a... presented evidence to challenge many of the items in this list of figures which is in the petition appendix at 16a and 17a that the Respondent presented, and I think we seriously challenged in the jury's eyes many of those figures."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.979,1550.044,"Well, you did... you did it as well as you could, and the jury just didn't believe you."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1550.044,1550.645,Well--
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.645,1553.036,"Or they didn't accept your story, anyway."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1553.036,1556.509,"--Well, I don't think it is fair to say that we did it as well as we could."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.899,1559.241,"Well, you had your chance, though."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1559.241,1566.864,"--Well, the Court of Appeals agreed that we were handicapped by an improper District Court instruction which did not direct the jury to do what it should have done."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.462,1608.401,"Well, then, I guess you are stuck with it if we think the substitute facility view is all right; you are stuck with the Court of Appeals deductions from this $750,000, I take it."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1608.401,1612.973,"--Well, we don't really know what that will amount to."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.973,1619.518,"On remand, on remand are they going to redetermine the value of the substitute facility or just determine some deductions?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1619.518,1630.687,"My understanding of the terms of the remand is that we will have an entirely new trial, so I don't suppose the government would be stuck, but again, if I may make the point--"
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.687,1637.991,"Why would they set aside the 750,000 valuation as a base from which to make some deductions?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1637.991,1656.874,"--I believe the Court of Appeals was persuaded by the government's argument to this extent, that there was a fundamental lack of a proper standard in the District Court's instruction, so there was no telling what that $750,000 represented, whether it just represented some ad hoc notion of compromise."
1984.83-1170,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1656.874,1660.497,"Let me go back, Counsel."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1666.148,1669.24,That would be our submission.
1984.83-1170,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1702.322,1725.638,"I suppose if the federal government was taking a local airport, you might have difficulty finding a fair market value of the airport as such unless it was adaptable for development, real estate development."
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1729.771,1748.003,"--An airport case might be, although it might be that there... that a low... as an airport has some special features, a large, assembled tract, but it might be that, depending on the area you are in, that plain, raw, undeveloped land would essentially be fungible."
1984.83-1170,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.998,1760.47,"It really would be hard to sell O'Hare Airport, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-1170,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1760.47,1766.035,"--I would think so, although maybe in some areas a small private, relatively small airport might be different."
1984.83-1170,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1777.372,1782.785,Mr. Nichols?
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,1782.785,1785.758,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.723,1869.062,"Mr. Nichols, how much time elapsed in this case between the first notice you had of the condemnation and the actual taking by the government, the dispossessing?"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,1869.062,1880.51,"Your Honor, they gave us the immediate notice and says, like I say, normally we'd give you 90 days, but we want it immediately because we don't want you to pollute our lake anymore, so you go out and get you another site."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.729,1927.501,"What, did you have less than 90 days or more than 90 days?"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,1927.501,1932.742,"Oh, we had only, we had only about two months, less than 90 days."
1984.83-1170,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.777,1946.102,"You referred, Mr. Nichols, to the language of the Constitution--"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,1946.102,1946.832,Yes.
1984.83-1170,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.832,1957.951,"--which is the starting point, but hasn't that language been embellished by construction to place on the meaning of the Constitution fair market value as the primary--"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,1957.951,1961.201,"Well, this Court has not said that, Your Honor."
1984.83-1170,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1968.016,1972.19,"--Not the only, no, but isn't that the starting point through the law generally?"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,1973.959,1979.563,"The starting point is just compensation, that what is just compensation."
1984.83-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2079.679,2087.345,"Well, now, Mr. Nichols, I guess your city had the right to go out and condemn another parcel and take it right away."
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2087.345,2093.89,"They have a right to get it in about 30 days, but the problem is not solved by that, Your Honor."
1984.83-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2123.977,2125.149,Or a prison.
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2125.149,2127.03,"Or a prison, sure."
1984.83-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2189.039,2196.375,"Now, would the cost of that be includable in the substitute cost figure that you would urge?"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2196.375,2197.445,"Yes, it was included."
1984.83-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2197.445,2202.029,And that the CA 5 would allow to be considered on remand?
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2202.029,2203.599,"It was, it was included."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.323,2255.705,The temporary one or the--
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2255.705,2256.634,The permanent one.
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.634,2257.575,--The permanent one.
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2257.575,2264.129,"We had spent $1,276,000 for that site."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.882,2293.77,"You are saying in effect, Mr. Nichols, that anything, any damage that was really proximately caused to you by the condemnation ought to be picked up by the government."
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2293.77,2303.216,--I'm saying that any reasonable expense that was reasonably necessary to provide a reasonably adequate substitute facility.
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2303.216,2320.057,"Well, but I think you are going against a large body of condemnation law there because traditionally, for instance, the owner of a small business whose site is condemned gets the fair market value of the site, but he gets nothing for good will, nothing for moving expenses."
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2330.024,2344.803,"Well, the Circuit Court, the Second Circuit, and the California Court has held that where you have a public condemnee, it's a unique situation and you use different rules to determine, to determine the loss sustained by the community."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.803,2356.879,"Well, why should that, why should a public condemnee such as your client be any different from a small businessman who suffers incompensible causal damage as a result of a condemnation?"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2356.879,2358.201,"Two reasons, Your Honor, I believe."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.436,2366.917,"Well, so what?"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2368.168,2371.621,"Well, you asked me why I think there's a difference, and I think--"
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2371.621,2373.171,You say it's a different purpose--
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2373.171,2373.912,--They do--
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2373.912,2376.664,--Why should the different purpose make any difference?
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2376.664,2391.844,"--Because this Court has said to the function of the Fifth Amendment is to see that fairness and equity are the result of the condemnation pay, and if--"
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2391.844,2397.968,"Well, you can make that argument just as well in the case of your small businessman as you can in the case of your local government."
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2397.968,2408.725,"--And the other reason that goes with that is that the local government has a duty, either legally or factually, to replace the facility."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2408.725,2410.095,Why has that got anything--
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2410.095,2411.346,Private individuals--
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2411.346,2413.698,"--No, why has that got anything to do with it?"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2416.469,2435.501,"--It bears upon the fact that that relates to the loss sustained by the community upon the condemnation of a public facility, and this Court has said that the objective to be reached in just compensation is to indemnify for loss sustained."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.961,2441.586,"The small, the small businessman is either going to have to get back in business or starve."
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2441.586,2443.416,--He may not get back in business at all.
1984.83-1170,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.168,2449.711,"Well, usually people like to get back in business."
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2449.711,2451.802,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.126,2481.211,"But now, I still don't understand from your submission, you have repeated the phrase several times, that the city was obligated to do this."
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2481.211,2482.262,"Yes, Sir."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.262,2484.093,Why does that make any difference?
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2484.093,2512.922,"Because it relates to the damage sustained by the city, and the Fifth Amendment is an indemnification provision, and if they have to replace it, they are entitled to be indemnified for the loss sustained, and the loss to a public entity that has to replace a facility is not the loss of the 50 acres, but the loss sustained by the community is the cost of acquiring a needed substitute facility."
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2514.082,2519.535,"But what... no case from this Court supports that proposition, does it?"
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2519.535,2522.868,That's because this Court says we haven't ruled on that question yet.
1984.83-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.89,2536.438,Suppose the only place you could get would require a road that cost $80 million to get to the place?
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2538.159,2539.33,"Well, let me say--"

1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2540.93,2571.631,"--Well, it would be, Your Honor, it would be the cost if that was a reasonable and necessary expense to provide a reasonably adequate substitute facility, and the other side of the coin is suppose it only cost $1000 and the land was worth $200,000, I think all we are entitled to is the reasonable cost of a reasonably adequate substitute facility, whether it is more or less of the value of the land being condemned, because that is the loss and damage sustained by the public."
1984.83-1170,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.406,2617.921,"--Well, the government, did the government agree from the very outset that it would go to the jury on this bifurcated instruction?"

1984.83-1170,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.748,2629.3,And the government said the--
1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2629.3,2635.856,"--And they said ours is the only one, except that I tried mine much stronger both ways than they tried theirs."

1984.83-1170,1,27746,h_louis_nichols,,2641.308,2642.568,I have tried it from the very beginning.
1984.83-1170,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.568,2643.719,Now I understand.

1984.83-1170,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2647.673,2649.714,Let me pose this question to you.

1984.83-1170,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3627.745,3629.495,I think--
1984.83-1170,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3629.495,3631.155,That's what I understood Note 9 to say.

1984.83-1170,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3734.354,3739.526,You have a jury verdict pursuant to instructions.

1984.83-1170,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3759.108,3761.22,But you didn't object to the instruction.

1984.83-1170,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3762.561,3766.935,"So if the instruction is all right, you lose."
