1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,450.442,451.241,That's right.
1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,451.646,452.944,So there is no disagreement or objection.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,452.944,453.824,Not at all.

1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,456.033,456.56,None at all.
1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,456.56,458.831,There's no disagreement with the Board's findings.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,458.831,459.258,Correct.
1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,459.258,461.477,(Inaudible)
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,461.477,462.088,That's correct.
1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,462.088,464.586,But the sense of the matter is the question of law.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,464.586,464.908,"Yes, sir."
1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,464.908,469.048,Unless (Inaudible) review of the finding.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,469.048,473.269,I would doubt it very much that the Court would want to do so.
1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,684.282,691.748,You know it's not correct that the Supreme -- the Court of Appeals in that before this Court's decision during the district.

1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,699.653,703.989,"The other is a very good language, yes, that's right."
1963.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.302,1001.058,"But Mr. Manoli, I -- you're not suggesting that -- that there must be proved that the employees realize what the employer's intent was."
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1001.058,1003.919,"Well, we do -- no, well, no."
1963.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.655,1035.825,"Well, assuming the only evidence -- assuming that this is -- that -- what he -- what he puts into effect is that something -- some normal increment that happened every year but -- but there is various evidence that he is -- he is told people and not his employees but he's told people and it is admitted that my purpose for doing this is to -- is to influence this election."
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1049.068,1050.127,"Yes, we would."
1963.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.127,1052.332,Irregardless of what the employees know.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1052.332,1053.675,I -- it's true.
1963.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.531,1056.919,That isn't this case.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1056.919,1057.46,I'm sorry?
1963.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.46,1058.966,That isn't this case.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1058.966,1079.758,"It isn't this case to begin with because here, it was fairly evident, it fairly evident what the employer was trying to do when he introduced these benefits at least on the finding has made by the Board and confirmed by the Court of Appeals that these benefits were introduced at this time solely for the purpose of inducing these employees to eject the union, and it was apparent to the employees."
1963.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.234,1118.234,Did the Board -- the Board spells out the finding of intent from the very facts that are evident to everybody?
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1118.234,1119.289,From the very fact?
1963.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.289,1122.735,From the -- from the facts that are -- that are evident to everyone.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1122.735,1122.981,Yes.
1963.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.981,1124.215,Evident to the employees.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1124.215,1126.347,The Board took these matters into consideration.
1963.26,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1226.053,1235.127,"Now, in this communications, which you told us about at the onset of the argument, there was a long review of previous benefits --"
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1235.127,1235.388,"Yes, sir."
1963.26,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.388,1265.028,"-- had been given over the years voluntarily by the employer that is that no union that use -- makes the point they voluntary, if -- if this case involved just that kind of review, if this case involve everything that you now have except for the two benefits given contemporaneously, would you -- would you have a violation of the Act?"
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1265.028,1270.679,I don't think the Board would have found a violation on those circumstances where the employer is primarily reciting what he has done in the past.
1963.26,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1270.679,1273.895,And strongly expressing his view to better not for the -- for the union.
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1273.895,1285.007,(Voice Overlap) the Board probably holds that such a communication in and of itself would probably be protected by its seat and this will get permissible -- permissible expression.
1963.26,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1285.007,1294.943,"Although presumably, in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement, if -- if benefits have been voluntarily conferred, they could've been voluntarily withdraw could they not?"
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1294.943,1295.837,"Yes, sir."
1963.26,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1295.837,1299.854,And so therefore wouldn't the same argument that you're now making would be applicable?
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1299.854,1307.18,"Well, except that in one -- in the first instance, he is merely -- he is merely indicating to them what the past -- what the past has been."

1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1402.766,1407.175,But the subject of (Inaudible)
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1407.175,1407.845,Exactly.
1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1407.845,1410.754,-- that the Court of Appeals would refer --
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1410.754,1411.025,"Yes, sir."
1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1411.025,1421.97,"-- so at least in epithet, there's a (Inaudible) aside to the question of whether both (Inaudible)"

1963.26,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1422.831,1431.864,So that one assumes that (Inaudible)
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1431.864,1434.149,Exactly.

1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1502.461,1502.971,"Yes, sir."
1963.26,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1502.971,1518.682,-- they might have a legitimate business consideration but at the same time that you can't (Inaudible) the mere fact that there's a taint (Inaudible) insufficient to this case (Inaudible)
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1518.682,1528.014,"The Board is -- the Board and the courts have held, Your Honor, that where an employer has two motives, two - two intents, a good and a bad one, he's stuck with the bad one."
1963.26,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1528.014,1536.533,(Inaudible)
1963.26,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1536.533,1539.65,"Well, Your Honor, I'm -- it puzzled me too."

1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2663.496,2671.73,"Well, if -- if this -- if the facts were, as I have -- as I have put in them and I said I put them for the sake of argument, would that be coercion?"
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2671.73,2672.515,"Well, I'm not sure."
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2684.199,2684.767,Yes.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2684.767,2705.022,"Now, I think that -- if on -- on March 4, we had said we are announcing additional benefits and suggesting in consideration of this additional grant, we appeal to you to vote against the union."
1963.26,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2758.945,2766.806,Which it says that this -- out of gratitude for the (Inaudible)
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2766.806,2770.91,"I -- I don't think, to my way of thinking if I may say so."
1963.26,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2790.231,2796.296,But not has it here two sufficient benefits.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2796.296,2797.191,"Oh, yes."
1963.26,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2797.787,2803.015,(Inaudible) appeal is that this guy has the only vote for the union.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2806.215,2807.451,No.
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2848.928,2852.335,I wonder if you could point out to me first off.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2856.366,2857.359,This -- this is precisely --
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2857.359,2857.397,Yes.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2857.397,2858.972,-- the thing that I proposed to do --
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2858.972,2859.361,Very well.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2859.361,2859.569,-- Mr. Chief Justice.
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2859.569,2863.63,Go ahead.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,2863.63,2879.118,"In so doing may I simply observe, as a preliminary thing, that one will find a sharp difference between what the Board said indeed in its decision by adopting what the trial examiner said and did, and what the Board talks about in its brief."
1963.26,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3085.159,3087.557,(Inaudible)
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3087.557,3095.914,"Yes, you do, 30%, as I recall, the rule of thumbs sometimes used and sometimes not that what happened here I don't know."
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3261.353,3261.56,Yes.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3267.879,3268.27,Well --
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3268.27,3268.317,How long?
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3268.317,3273.923,-- we made it about the first of -- of January but long before we knew anything about the Board's decision long before we knew about (Voice Overlap)--
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3273.923,3274.138,No.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3275.435,3275.56,Excuse me.
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3275.56,3280.643,-- about how long after the convention was that that you made this change?
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3280.643,3281.67,On the payroll?
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3281.67,3281.697,Yes.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3281.697,3282.587,And -- and the scheduling of vacation --
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3282.587,3283.156,And this -- this fringe benefit.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3283.156,3289.792,"-- as the convention was -- was the last part of October, if Your Honor please."
1963.26,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3324.791,3340.808,(Inaudible)
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3340.808,3342.662,"No, I -- I won't try to go behind."
1963.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3503.246,3504.624,(Inaudible)
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3504.624,3504.918,Yes.
1963.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.918,3526.716,"-- didn't the Board give the position that the hearing before the examiner -- didn't the Board take the position before the examiner and before the Board that there was an unfair -- well, didn't it take the position as motive or intent was irrelevant?"
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3526.716,3530.334,It certainly did and that finds expression in the -- in the trial examiner's report (Voice overlap)--
1963.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.334,3532.016,And the trial examiner --
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3532.016,3533.235,-- and there's nothing else.
1963.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3565.044,3576.394,"And that was the Board's position that -- that in any circumstances in nearly granting their benefits, pending an election, is -- is not permissible --"
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3576.394,3576.412,We --
1963.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3576.412,3578.18,"-- regardless of motive, that was their position."
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3578.18,3587.009,-- we think that's precisely right and that's what I had in mind when I say that it's difficult for me to recognize the brief and the decision as going to the same case.
1963.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3587.009,3602.481,But the examiner did find and the Board adopted its findings that granting the foregoing benefits -- that the company granted the foregoing benefits in -- in order to interfere with restraining coerce (Voice Overlap)--
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3602.481,3602.968,Yes.
1963.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3602.968,3609.375,The examiner did find that but he went right on and said that internal motive is irrelevant and immaterial anyway.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3609.375,3610.675,That's correct.
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3690.505,3690.605,Very well.
1963.26,1,33901,karl_h_mueller,,3690.605,3691.889,And I appreciate the question.
1963.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3692.064,3694.118,Thank you.
