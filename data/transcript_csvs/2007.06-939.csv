2007.06-939,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-939, Chamber of Commerce versus Brown."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,7.07,23.413,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In AB 1889, California defunded employer speech about union organizing because the State's labor policy is that such speech interferes with employee free choice."
2007.06-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,44.307,46.741,Why do you say the labor policy promotes it?
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,50.045,65.304,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that if you look at the exceptions to the policy, in particular those that allow State funds to be spent for things that clearly facilitate union organizing, for example, that it's not prohibited under AB--"
2007.06-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,65.304,67.72,"--No, I'm talking about the... the Federal policy."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,80.98,83.099,"--I think... I think it is, Your Honor."
2007.06-939,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,129.627,140.5,Then why did Congress in several statutes have a provision from which California copied when it enacted this measure?
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,163.682,169.019,"Your Honor, those are three statutes that the court below and Respondents rely on heavily."
2007.06-939,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.499,198.038,But they run against that principle because they say at least under these programs... I think there were more than three.
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,199.638,201.724,"--Medicare was the fourth, I believe."
2007.06-939,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.607,230.892,--Those... those grantees would be subject to the NLRA.
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,232.709,237.713,"--Well, it's not modified in the same way that AB 1889 modifies it, Your Honor."
2007.06-939,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,269.499,272.133,"Say: Speak, go ahead, speak, speak."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,273.233,279.937,"Well, I think that's clearly what they say, but it's not that simple given the way this statute operates, Your Honor."
2007.06-939,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,279.937,294.63,"And they also say... by the way, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind... you may be right about it being too much of an administrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but they've made major concessions here, and they say that's a matter to be worked out on remand."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,307.79,310.241,"If I may respond to both questions, Your Honor."
2007.06-939,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,359.072,359.405,Well--
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,359.405,360.188,The State has effectively--
2007.06-939,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,360.188,361.388,--That's not the State's fault.
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,361.388,368.292,"--Well, the State's argument to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's a free-market choice."
2007.06-939,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,372.76,375.612,"Well, they can do business with other entities beside the State."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,375.612,386.502,"--They can, Your Honor, that's true, but that doesn't answer the question because for those that... because of the service that they provide, such as under Medi-Cal, they have chosen to be in business with the State."
2007.06-939,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.656,405.547,"If you have... you have a park service of the State and have you a hotdog stand there, it runs the hotdogs, it's private, but the State pays for everything."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,422.674,425.793,"--Well, a grant presents a slightly different problem."
2007.06-939,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,425.793,426.176,Why?
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,443.588,449.674,"Well, that may be the case for a particular program or a particular grant, but that's not what AB 1889 does, Your Honor."
2007.06-939,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.202,492.132,"I thought you... you are bringing a facial challenge, and I thought that you must show, not that the State must show, and the State... the simple argument is look we are paying for certain things, and we want to get what we paid for."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,510.094,517.35,--That might be an argument that the State could advance credibly if in fact this statute had anything to do with saving money.
2007.06-939,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.828,544.85,Where did the lower court say it has nothing to do with the State getting what it is paying for and not paying for things it doesn't want to pay for?
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,544.85,547.369,"--Well, Your Honor, that's, of course, my vernacular for--"
2007.06-939,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,547.369,548.302,That in--
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,548.302,560.879,"--what the court said, but what the court did say was that the State passed... legislature passed and the governor signed AB 1889 solely for labor policy purposes, and that's clear from the preamble to the statute."
2007.06-939,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.24,589.546,"--So it would come out... it would come out differently if the statute has said, we want to get what we pay for and we don't... we choose not to pay for labor relations?"
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,589.546,606.722,"--Well, if the State could establish that it was acting as a proprietor, within meaning of this Court's decision in Boston Harbor, and establish as a proprietor that it was doing something to advance a fiscal purpose, then perhaps a statute so worded would survive the pre-emption challenge."
2007.06-939,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,708.735,715.322,Did they say something different from what Congress said in those three or four statutes that were mentioned earlier?
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,715.322,730.934,"In terms of using the words assist, promote and deter, those words appear in those statutes in that Medicare regulation, or statute, component of the Medicare statute, and those appear also in, in AB 1899."
2007.06-939,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,771.476,777.213,"If you take the example of a nursing home that participates in the Medi-Cal program, what does this require?"
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,792.389,795.46,They can't use any of those funds.
2007.06-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.927,908.796,"Even if he guesses right, he is subject to the litigation."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,908.796,909.479,--I'm sorry.
2007.06-939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.479,913.848,"You said if he guesses wrong, he is subject to litigation."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,916.117,932.845,"That's correct, Your Honor, and unlike the prevailing party as the defendant, or the prevailing party will of course... the prevailing plaintiff and the prevailing intervenors will recover reasonable costs of attorney's fees, the prevailing defendant under this statute does not."
2007.06-939,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,972.286,973.136,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-939,0,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,979.956,980.756,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2007.06-939,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,983.189,985.474,Mr. Hungar.
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,985.474,998.099,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The National Labor Relations Act manifests congressional intent to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management."
2007.06-939,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1008.923,1011.191,What about the spending clause question?
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1027.535,1035.723,"Well, first of all, obviously, Your Honor, the National Labor Relations Act does not constrain Congress' ability to impose particular restrictions."
2007.06-939,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1042.746,1049.816,How do we tell whether they are using their spending power to regulate as opposed to simply attaching conditions to what's done with State funds?
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1049.816,1060.106,"The Court has identified several factors that it has used to distinguish regulatory from proprietary conduct, first and foremost, as this Court said in Boston Harbor."
2007.06-939,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1075.301,1085.656,"On a case like Rust versus Sullivan, is the Federal Government acting to promote policy, or is it simply acting in a proprietary capacity?"
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1085.656,1093.743,"--Well, of course, that question did not come up in Rust against Sullivan because there was in a NLRA pre-emption issue there, and the question that the State was--"
2007.06-939,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1093.743,1097.445,I'm talking about spending power versus regulatory power in general.
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1097.445,1110.105,"--But what the Court did say in Rust is that the government has a legitimate policy interest in advancing its preference for life, in that case, that the Congress was entitled to advance."
2007.06-939,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1137.339,1147.111,"Well, give me an example of a spending clause provision that would be acceptable, not necessarily in this context, but in general, because you would say, well, that's not trying to implement a policy at all."
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1147.111,1164.907,"Well, if the... one of the amicus briefs in this case points to a rule that the State has adopted recently apparently in the Medi-Cal context, which says that they will only reimburse administrative costs of hospitals up to the 50th percentile of costs incurred by similar facilities."
2007.06-939,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1190.224,1209.97,"Would your answer be the same if... if... and I hide contrary to fact, perhaps, that a magic administrative scheme were invented so that there was no administrative problem, we could identify with the greatest of ease each penny that came from a State and which did not?"
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1261.153,1272.044,"--Justice Breyer, I think... I'm assuming in your hypothetical that this hypothetical law, in addition to posing no administrative burdens also doesn't have the strict liability of treble damages."
2007.06-939,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.044,1278.865,"No, on all these things which I think they are asking us on the other side to leave for another day, none of them exist."
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1300.411,1301.23,Justice Breyer--
2007.06-939,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1301.23,1304.265,"By the way, other states have exactly opposite rules, they are right-to-work states."
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1311.936,1315.621,--Obviously that would be a very different case.
2007.06-939,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1315.621,1330.13,"--Ah, well, if it's a very different case, then why aren't they right to say this is a facial challenge, leave that very different case which raises all the issues to be worked out when we discover whether this is--"
2007.06-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.13,1331.665,Why do you say it's a very different case Mr. Hungar?
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1333.065,1347.925,"It's a very different case in the sense that in this case it's... from every one of the factors that this Court has looked to, to determine regulatory versus proprietary... and this case cuts fairly in favor of the conclusion of the unanimous court of appeals, all 15 judges, that this is regulatory."
2007.06-939,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.37,1399.458,--Is my right-to-work example equally... equally pre-empted?
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1399.458,1400.524,"Yes, I think it would be."
2007.06-939,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.226,1423.223,"So, they could not say in Utah, to take a State at random, the... here we have government grants and there's overhead, and we would like you to spend this overhead; indeed, you're certainly free to spend this overhead in speaking as much as you want, should there be an organizing campaign."
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1427.627,1435.031,--Well... I took your... the Utah example to be one where the State was somehow mandating this particular expenditure.
2007.06-939,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1435.031,1435.697,No.
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1435.697,1441.451,"If the State is simply... is not taking... is taking a hands-off approach, it's hard to characterize it as regulation."
2007.06-939,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1512.197,1521.553,What policy was Congress implementing in the Federal funding statute that California copied?
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1521.553,1525.374,"--Your Honor, California did not copy any Federal statutes."
2007.06-939,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.925,1538.181,"But they do say that the money is not to be spent to assist, promote, or deter union organizing."
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1538.181,1541.216,"Yes, there are three Federal statutes that impose use restrictions."
2007.06-939,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1541.216,1542.383,And why do they do that?
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1542.383,1550.655,"It's not clear why they did that, other than obviously they were choosing not to compensate those particular kinds of costs as well as the others."
2007.06-939,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.556,1589.697,"But you don't... there's no reason, rhyme or reason to what they would have done in these three statutes that you say is flatly contrary to national labor relations policy?"
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1589.697,1598.136,"Well, it's not contrary to national labor relations policy, because Congress has chosen to create an exception, and it has the right to do so; the State does not."
2007.06-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.136,1599.172,It was labor policy.
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1606.826,1608.86,In... in a specific program--
2007.06-939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.86,1609.443,Right.
2007.06-939,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1609.443,1615.181,--which obviously the State's law does not apply to those programs; it applies to State spending across the board.
2007.06-939,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.814,1616.697,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1620.668,1645.367,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Until this statute was enacted, California was in the anomalous position that it was financing speech on one side of union organizing campaigns but not on the other, because most grants, programs, contracts include employment costs as an allowable cost."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.367,1650.985,"Well, so was anyone who hired a company to do any kind of work, right?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1659.304,1662.173,Yes.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1670.546,1702.0,"I'm not sure why you characterize California as financing one side of a debate, because... and this I think is sort of the nub of the disagreement between the two sides here... their argument is that a State can determine what it wants to buy with its money, but what California is doing is telling its contractor what it can do with the money after the State has got what it paid for."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1702.0,1703.633,"That's not correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1703.633,1704.619,And that's the--
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1704.619,1706.035,That's what they claim.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1706.035,1711.206,--I understand that is the basic distinction between a case like Rust and a case like this.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1711.206,1711.689,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1711.689,1717.157,They're trying to control their profits as opposed to determining what they get... what you get for your money.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1718.843,1734.935,"Well, that's true if it were the case that the State's statute said: Even after you have earned this money by performing all the service we asked, you still can't... it's therefore now your money; you can't use it."
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1739.506,1753.397,"Well, is there any case in which California claims that it has not gotten the service that it paid for as a result of the position which an employer... a grantee employer took on... on a unionization issue?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1753.397,1767.657,"Well, there haven't been any cases decided under this statute, but what the court of appeals pointed out is that the Petitioners did not move for summary judgment on the ground that you're forbidding us from using our money."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.631,1779.797,"No, that's not quite accurate."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1785.035,1785.785,--Right.
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1785.785,1786.82,--and that that activity was pre-empted.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1786.82,1787.42,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1799.995,1800.611,Why do you say
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1838.853,1839.636,--No.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1861.785,1868.522,"Yes, but if they give them grant money... let's say it's a grant rather than a contract, and I assume that's, you know, the point you're making."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1881.782,1882.599,Correct.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1882.599,1893.757,"Not to... not to enforce labor policy of one sort or another, but to promote the arts or conservation or whatever the organization does."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1930.177,1936.6,"Well, first, if they don't spend all the grant money on the prescribed purposes, they have to give it back to the State because grants aren't profit--"
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1936.6,1944.17,"Yes, but I assume they are entitled to some overhead cost which would include the cost of their employee-related... managing employee relations?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1944.17,1944.52,--Right.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1945.372,1947.005,So that wouldn't be money left over.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1947.738,1953.776,"--Right, but that, Your Honor, is where the concern that the State was addressing comes in."
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1976.022,1987.93,"--So, is the argument that the employer in fact... that the employer is in fact devoting less of the grant money to the purpose of the grant, so that it falls within Rust?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1987.93,1989.147,Well... yes.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.292,2004.875,But the--
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2004.875,2006.625,"--against a union or for a union, for that matter."
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.625,2017.516,--The difference between this and Rust is that the Federal Government in Rust was assuredly following a Federal policy.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2017.516,2018.382,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.382,2023.253,But it was a Federal policy that the Federal Government had every right to implement.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2025.705,2026.438,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.438,2048.237,"The issue here is whether the policy that California is trying to implement... namely, we do not want the employer to... in its view... disrupt the... the labor management relations by... by opposing union... unionization."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2048.237,2048.853,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.853,2054.641,"That... that is the issue, whether that is a policy that California can... can implement."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2054.641,2063.58,"That is not the State's policy, and the preamble to the statute does not say: the State disapproves of employers spending money."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.663,2069.132,"No, but the policy... the policy is they don't want employers to talk about unionization."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2069.132,2069.734,--No.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.268,2075.888,Why?
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2078.638,2079.922,Because the State wants--
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.922,2080.572,--their labor policy?
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2080.572,2084.525,"--Because the State wants to be neutral, and that... the right--"
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2084.525,2103.152,"Then that... then that, it seems to me, cuts the feet off your argument of a moment ago, that in fact the State's concern is that it's getting less of what it thought it was getting for with its grant, because more is being spent on labor policy."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2126.65,2129.852,"--Well, it prohibits them using the State's money to do it."
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2131.637,2145.396,"Well, your argument a moment ago is that they were using the State's money because in fact they were providing less of the service that the grant was for and spending that in... in conversation with employees about labor unions."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2161.489,2165.358,"I don't think I said ""inconsistently""."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2195.46,2212.303,"How is that... how is that different from saying there's a Federal rule, an OSHA requirement you've got to have certain protective devices or whatever, and the State says, well, we want to get the most out of our money, so our money cannot be used to put in these federally required safety devices; you can use somebody else's money for that."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2222.544,2231.216,--Because there is no Federal labor policy that requires States to use State treasury money to finance a party who is engaged in this debate.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.666,2235.599,Just like... like Gould.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2255.579,2257.447,"Right, but there we're saying we won't deal with you."
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.118,2270.487,Why wouldn't that be the State's managing its own money?
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2271.939,2272.855,"Well, But it is not--"
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.855,2276.407,We just don't want to deal with people who oppose unions.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2276.407,2286.781,"--No, there's a huge difference between saying, don't use our money to do something, and saying, we won't deal with you even when you use your own money to do it."
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2289.248,2292.083,"But on your argument, there is no ""your own money""."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2299.522,2300.039,--Correct.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2300.039,2303.791,But that distinction that you just made in answer to Justice Scalia could not be drawn.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2303.791,2305.993,"Well, if they have their own money, they can spend it on that."
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2307.445,2317.301,"No, the hypothesis of this whole argument is that we are talking with a grantee who was fully funded by... I thought fully funded by the State, and I thought that was your strongest argument."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2325.99,2336.881,"Well, if we have a grantee who has no other money, that doesn't mean the State has an obligation to provide them money to oppose unionization."
2007.06-939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.074,2358.378,"Mr. Gottesman, can I ask sort of a background question to be sure I understand your position?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2373.57,2375.339,Employer speech with its own money?
2007.06-939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.339,2376.106,Yes.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2376.106,2378.208,"Of course that would be pre-empted, absolutely pre-empted."
2007.06-939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.208,2378.708,Okay.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2378.708,2385.112,"If not pre-empted, it would certainly be a violation of the First Amendment as well, to punish them for engaging in speech."
2007.06-939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.112,2391.266,"Well, if they adopted the rule that the Federal labor board applied prior to the Taft-Hartley Act."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2391.266,2391.766,Exactly.
2007.06-939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.766,2392.466,That's what I'm asking.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2392.466,2393.051,Exactly.
2007.06-939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.501,2394.251,That would be pre-empted?
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2394.251,2395.134,Of course that would be pre-empted.
2007.06-939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2395.134,2396.003,I want to be sure.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2396.003,2403.156,"Our position, however, is that it's quite different to say that the National Labor Relations Act requires the State to pay for these activities."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2403.923,2404.423,Why--
2007.06-939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.423,2413.429,It does require that this... it arguably requires that this area of combat between labor and management be unregulated.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2413.429,2414.429,--Right.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.566,2452.47,I think your reason for not paying for this activity is that you don't like this activity.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2452.47,2452.987,That's not true.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.987,2455.839,I call that... I call that regulating the activity.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2455.839,2457.322,"That is not at all the case, Your Honor."
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.164,2478.371,"Well, you allow the employer to engage in all other employee relations, and you're willing... that can be done without... the one thing the employer can't do is speak out against the union."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2479.604,2480.637,"Well, you've got for or against."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2575.951,2580.17,--You're saying it doesn't give favoritism to one side or another?
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2580.17,2582.689,--It just takes the State's money out.
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.689,2590.343,"So that depends, as a practical matter, on the view that there are at least some employers who would be arguing in favor of unionization?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2590.343,2594.347,"Well, it wouldn't matter if they were arguing for or against."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.13,2598.698,"Yes, but my point is that there are precious few who argue in favor of it."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2598.698,2599.148,--Right.
2007.06-939,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2629.501,2645.593,"Well, when the State pays a program participant... let's again take the case of a nursing home... for providing services to patients who are covered by Medi-Cal, and money is paid to the nursing home, it's your position that remains the State 's money."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2645.593,2652.283,If this... if the nursing home... there are a number of different ways in which this money is paid to the State.
2007.06-939,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2698.645,2699.764,Let me just be clear.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2716.707,2717.392,Yes.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.453,2741.507,"--Well, the question of when the contract is done is different from the question of when the money is paid."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2741.507,2742.791,--Of course.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.557,2745.209,He is asking with when the money is paid.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2745.209,2751.03,So when you pay the money up front and you say here is your money to do the contract--
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2751.03,2755.315,"Well, what about the situation in which the contract runs for a year and you bill monthly?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2769.341,2773.645,"--Well, that's... that's a question about a meaning of a provision that isn't at this issue in this case."
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2774.912,2792.624,"Well, do you concede that if they... if all they did under a 12-month contract was... was bill for services rendered every past 30 days, that there would be either no application of the California law or that the application would be pre-empted?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2792.624,2795.392,--That might well be the case.
2007.06-939,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2798.261,2798.894,I'm sorry.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2802.213,2802.914,Oh.
2007.06-939,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2804.281,2805.864,It's like saying yes.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2805.864,2807.047,Yes.
2007.06-939,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.689,2838.168,"So you did on that point on page 27 and 25 and 29 of the ""A F L C I O> [=AFL-CIO] brief, I took the statements there, where it would say <organizations"", namely organizations, even those that receive a hundred percent of their money from the State are free to use their profits?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2838.168,2839.552,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.552,2842.37,"If there are any, or any other non-state moneys they had?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2842.37,2845.858,And we the State responded say the same thing in our brief.
2007.06-939,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2859.682,2866.937,"So if you sell them tables and they write you a check, the State, for the tables, at that point the check is yours?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2866.937,2867.437,Of course.
2007.06-939,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2867.437,2868.52,All right.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2868.52,2873.191,"There is no question about that, because in that case, that would be covered by the contract provision that isn't here."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2882.78,2888.766,"What if there is a warranty for another year, say if these tables break you have to replace them?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2888.766,2894.254,"--Well, that's a question of... remember, neither of the lower courts has interpreted this statute."
2007.06-939,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2965.684,2977.741,"What is your recommendation as to... we've heard today, too, in the briefs it's there, I put the thing that I've heard as... well, the example with the tables is an example of it."
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3005.226,3010.528,"Is affirm, because all the court has said is the motion for summary judgment was improperly granted."
2007.06-939,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3010.528,3013.296,"And if we did that, how would all these problems be worked out?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3022.235,3042.482,"Well, first of all, let's talk about the burdens, the accounting burdens, which are actually quite minimal under Medicaid, because they already have to do this because the Federal Medicaid requires them to... to account for which were allowable expenditures and which were not in a very detailed accounting form."
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3050.921,3052.622,"You're not going to go through all of these one by one, are you?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3052.622,3053.14,Pardon?
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3068.799,3072.834,Let me ask you a basic question that doesn't require you to get into one by one.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3094.966,3095.816,Give who.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.816,3103.472,--shall be used... shall be used for collective bargaining or for any... any activities involving unions.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3103.472,3108.191,That would be... that would be the moneys we give to the employer?
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.191,3108.709,Same.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3109.259,3110.793,I'm not sure which question you're asking.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.793,3111.495,To the employer.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3130.323,3133.425,I think that would be problematic but only for this reason.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.082,3170.182,Why does that... why does that make a difference?
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3182.674,3183.107,--Right.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.393,3187.709,You could say the same about that other one.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3187.709,3199.267,"--This statute simply says we don't want to subsidize either party, and as a practical matter we are only subsidizing one party in union organizing."
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.267,3201.069,So does the statute I posit.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3209.075,3209.809,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.809,3212.444,That clearly would be banned and I don't see why yours is any different.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3212.444,3222.482,Well because... it would not be banned if the State had said we don't want you to use State money to negotiate contracts with any of your employees; that would not be banned.
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3231.672,3236.242,I want to get back to your responses on the procedural costs of the case.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3240.444,3240.878,Yes.
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3243.13,3248.45,"Does it make any difference if the argument is which is what I understood it to be, that you can't regulate at all?"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3255.121,3257.14,But our argument is that this is not regulation.
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3262.209,3262.876,That gets to the--
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3262.876,3263.393,--It just says--
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3263.393,3264.576,--That gets to the spending clause question.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3271.982,3272.482,--Yes.
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3272.482,3275.934,But it doesn't mean that it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3275.934,3280.219,"Well, we are not regulating whether the employer opposes unions."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3291.694,3293.396,That doesn't seem to me to be responsive to my question.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3306.136,3312.023,"--Well, if you say that a State's position,"
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3314.539,3316.225,You're getting back to the spending question.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3316.225,3317.291,--is regulation--
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3317.291,3318.01,I'm putting that aside.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3318.01,3321.629,--I'm having... the problem I'm having with Your Honor's question is presuming the answer to something.
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3332.568,3335.102,Regardless of whether... regardless of whether it's burdensome regulation.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3335.102,3335.819,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3335.819,3339.238,If it's regulation why isn't that appropriate to deal with on summary judgment.
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3350.196,3350.529,Right.
2007.06-939,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3376.179,3379.048,"But on that point you're in disagreement with the Ninth Circuit, and--"
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3379.048,3379.865,"Yes, we are."
2007.06-939,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3406.948,3411.702,--So the principal rationale for the Ninth Circuit's opinion is incorrect in your view?
2007.06-939,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3411.702,3414.138,"Well, it's not... no."
2007.06-939,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3452.779,3454.296,"Thank you, Counsel."

2007.06-939,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3594.234,3598.222,What about the Lyng case that Mr. Gottesman cited in response to that argument?
2007.06-939,3,44813,willis_j_goldsmith,,3598.222,3602.939,The Lyng case seems to me to be completely off the point on the pre-emption issue.
2007.06-939,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3620.601,3625.969,"Well, Lyng said that the... that Congress was being neutral not that it was making a choice on how to spend its funds."
