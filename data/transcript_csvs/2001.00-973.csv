2001.00-973,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,9.004,12.262,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2001.00-973,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.813,198.813,Mr. Dreeben?
2001.00-973,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.906,236.728,your points two and three quite fit together.
2001.00-973,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,236.728,270.416,Ou- our second argument is that the proper inquiry into whether an error affects substantial rights is whether there is an effect on the outcome of the proceeding.
2001.00-973,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,270.416,290.98,That that I understand.
2001.00-973,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,290.98,350.365,"Well, it is it's a difficult inquiry to make if there is no information in the record that sheds light on it, and in that instance, the party that bears the burden of proof will probably lose, which is why it matters whether the standard is plain error review, in which the defendant bears the burden of proof, or harmless error review, in which case the Government bears the burden of proof."
2001.00-973,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.365,382.131,"Mr. Dreeben, if we answer what is your second question in your petition, not as outlined this morning, the second question being, do you look to the entire record or just the rule eleven colloquy, if we answer that question in your favor, look to the entire record, is it necessary to get into the two anterior questions that you outline, that is plain error versus harmless error, and then this one that troubled Justice Kennedy that you don't list as a question in your cert petition?"
2001.00-973,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,382.131,417.547,"Justice Ginsburg, I believe the Court can reverse the judgment based solely on a favorable resolution for the Government of the third question presented that is, if the Court does look to the entire record in this case, then I believe that the Ninth Circuit's judgment is incorrect even if it were correct on the other two points that I've outlined."
2001.00-973,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,417.547,437.761,"But if the if that is an academic question, that is, if you could argue, as I think you do, if you look at the whole record, then it doesn't matter what standard you apply, harmless error, plain error."
2001.00-973,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,437.761,452.638,"That is true, and the Court could resolve the case solely on that basis."
2001.00-973,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.638,472.625,Alternatively we we could resolve it just on the basis of your third point.
2001.00-973,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,472.625,477.315,That would be resolution on what I think is the first question that we present in the...
2001.00-973,1,36124,monica_knox,,1763.855,1846.79,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2001.00-973,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.79,1856.533,"Well, what is the reasoning behind you say your position is that plain error is never applicable."
2001.00-973,1,36124,monica_knox,,1856.533,1896.156,"Well, the initial starting place is what the advisory committee did."
2001.00-973,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3555.934,3559.794,Unless the Court has any short questions the Government will submit.
2001.00-973,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3559.794,3563.392,"Very well, the case is submitted."
