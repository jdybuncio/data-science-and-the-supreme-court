1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.297,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-740, Walter L. Nixon v. the United States."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,10.348,18.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,65.095,72.27,--I suppose when you call it a trial before 12 Senators.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,72.27,84.206,"--Well, Your Honor, we do think that the proceeding that anyone comfortable with judicial proceedings would identify as the trial did in fact occur before the committee, and indeed, if you look at Rule 11--"
1992.91-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,84.206,86.52,"Well, that's what the case is all about, I suppose."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,86.52,86.81,--It is indeed.
1992.91-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,86.81,87.24,"Yes, all right."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,87.24,100.701,The Impeachment Trial Clause ensures that the Senate will approach the cases and exercise its ultimate power to remove executive and judicial officers with great care and deliberation.
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,100.701,104.815,"Well, Mr. Stewart, you refer to it as the Impeachment Trial Clause."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,111.939,131.392,"Well, Your Honor, that certainly has been the position of respondents, that that is the only... that word sole is the only relevant word in the passage, and that word cuts off all review by the courts, but I think that that reading of that word hangs such a tremendous amount on that word that it's really not defensible."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,131.392,136.835,"Well, I... you know, certainly that would be a fairly partial way to refer to it."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,143.533,151.339,"I'm not trying to be partial here, Your Honor, I am simply trying to demonstrate... to describe it... it does seem to describe an impeachment trial."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.339,152.599,You can be partial.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,155.343,155.503,Fair enough.
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.503,156.254,It's all right.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,157.015,169.925,But there are several elements that the trial and other elements of the Constitution require a limited... that limit the power of the Senate in conducting these impeachments.
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.755,215.944,"Well, Mr. Stewart, do you think the high crimes and misdemeanors language is such that the interpretation by this Court could supersede that of the Senate?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,233.065,238.13,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that could be reviewable, and that the Court has to face up to that."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.4,275.796,"What would the language have meant, in your view, if the word sole were not there, if it simply said the Senate shall have the power to try all impeachments?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,275.796,283.433,"--Well, of course, that's the way the clause was written as it was initially approved, and it was only in the Committee of Style that the word sole was adopted."
1992.91-740,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.619,320.968,"Well, would it be reviewable, in your view, if a quorum was not present at all times, and could a Senator vote ultimately who had not heard all of the evidence, in your view?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,324.611,328.304,"Your Honor, those are two different questions, I think, and let me try to answer them separately."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.868,381.371,But you think it is a trial if people who haven't been present at the proceedings come in and vote.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,382.552,384.964,"It is a Senate trial as provided in the Constitution, yes."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.147,389.067,I don't know how you're drawing the line between the one and the other.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,389.067,391.129,--If you look at--
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.129,397.873,"I thought a trial means you present evidence before someone who then decides, the person to whom the evidence has been presented."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,400.225,411.113,"--I have no problem with the proposition that the Framers intended all Senators to be present, but what they provided in the text of the Constitution is that the Senate can conduct its business with a quorum present."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.048,422.7,"You say a quorum present during the trial, right?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,422.7,423.389,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,423.389,426.812,"But it can be a different... your point is, it can be a different quorum."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,426.812,428.054,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.054,433.717,"One portion of the Senate can hear the evidence, and another portion vote, and that's a trial."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,433.717,437.45,Surely undesirable from a point of citizenship--
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.45,437.59,I know it's undesirable.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,437.85,437.96,--But yes.
1992.91-740,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.571,447.727,"What about this Court, if we exercise original jurisdiction and appoint a master, and we don't all sit there and hear the evidence."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,452.211,459.694,Those proceedings do not resemble an impeachment proceeding to the extent that they involve stripping an individual of rights.
1992.91-740,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.217,471.844,"Oh, well, I think they could involve a great many rights... water rights, or one thing and another... that are terribly important."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,471.844,478.508,--But there is no provision in the Constitution that provides that the trial must be before this Court in those cases.
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.25,504.637,What would you do if the Senate did not allow the accused official to face and confront the witnesses against him?
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,504.637,510.361,"Your Honor, I'm not sure I completely understand the question."
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,510.822,514.313,"Well, the Senate says you can't cross-examine any of the witnesses against you."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,514.313,517.369,"--Your Honor, I think that would not--"
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.369,519.558,And you can't be in the room when they're testifying.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,519.558,547.446,"--To answer the first question, you can't cross-examine the witnesses, we state that the irreducible requirement of the trial is the opportunity to present your case, present your witnesses, and confront the witnesses against you, so there would be a right of cross-examination, and you could pose that hypothetical where there is no right of cross-examination, and I would say that is not a trial, but if the issue were one of the scope of cross-examination, that would be one confined to the discretion of the Senate."
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,547.446,550.669,What is the standard?
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,561.588,567.782,"There has to be a specific requirement in the Constitution, and I draw this from Baker and Carr and also from Powell v. McCormack."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.104,608.781,"Mr. Stewart, in both the trial of Samuel Chase and the trial of Andrew Johnson there was a great deal of motion being made and demands made for continuance on the part of the defendants, and the Senate insisted in both cases that they be brought to trial much more rapidly than would be conceivable in an ordinary criminal case."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,620.651,630.015,"No, sir, and in those instances as I recall the case was extended for a substantial period of time and there certainly was an opportunity to prepare, but no, I do not think that would be reviewable."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.015,639.692,"Well, would you say that if you're going to be divested of the office of associate justice or of President that 10 days was sufficient to prepare?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,639.692,658.286,"No, I would not, an interestingly, I think the Framers imposing the Trial Clause were very wise to impose the Trial Clause, because when you're dealing with the chief justice or a justice of the Supreme Court or the President, there is a political attention to this which I think will slow down the process in most instances."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.515,678.791,So you would read the Trial Clause differently if you're dealing with a lower court judge than if you're dealing with some highly visible official?
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,678.791,680.544,"I don't mean to say that, Your Honor, no."
1992.91-740,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,685.856,691.991,You rest your argument on the assumption that the meaning of the word trial is clear.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,697.777,724.883,"Your Honor, I think to rule in our favor the Court has to conclude that the word try does have meaning and the meaning is as we say that there is an irreducible requirement of an opportunity to present your case and confront your case, and that meaning I don't think is so elusive when you compare the impeachment clause to other clauses of the Constitution creating powers for the Senate... for example, the power to be the judge of elections."
1992.91-740,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,768.152,789.296,"All right, but if we should disagree with you about the clarity of meaning, do I understand you correctly to concede that the case should... and we conclude that the word is ambiguous, do I understand you correctly to concede that the case should be decided just as it would be as if we were dealing with an issue which the Constitution did not expressly address in any way?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,800.584,803.016,"Your Honor, I think we would lose."
1992.91-740,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,808.562,809.831,But that's the least of your concerns.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,809.831,809.981,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-740,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,809.981,810.522,Okay.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,820.409,829.475,"Yes, it is, and I'd be happy to address it, because it seems to me that justiciability, as I was saying earlier, hangs so much on the word sole."
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,898.843,911.021,Could the accused official waive the right that you claim is his?
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,930.685,931.196,Absolutely.
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,935.49,942.806,But if you were a Senator I take it you would stand up on the floor of the Senate and say I must point out that this is an unconstitutional proceeding.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,942.806,950.11,"--If I were a Senator and I objected to that because I wanted to hear the testimony, then I would have the right to go listen to the testimony."
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.11,954.891,"Well, I think you'd have the obligation to tell your colleagues that they are proceeding in an unconstitutional manner, wouldn't you?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,954.891,969.601,"You would have the... you could do so, but no, I don't think that that is proceeding in an unconstitutional manner, because the right inheres in the individual, and if the individual chooses to waive that right, he certainly has the power to do so."
1992.91-740,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.63,1005.334,So you really are suggesting we treat this case as though there hadn't been any trial at all in terms of judiciability.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1005.334,1006.456,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.874,1062.554,"Well, when the Constitution gives this Court original jurisdiction in certain matters... those, for example, in which a State is a party, don't you think that meant that the trial would be before us?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1067.397,1074.613,"Your Honor, I'm not sure that I... I think that's certainly a tenable view, but it is not the use of the word try."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.606,1085.651,"No, it doesn't use the word try, but doesn't original jurisdiction contemplate that the trial would be before the Supreme Court, and yet we do exactly what you say can't be done in the Senate trial."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1088.095,1100.483,"--I think it may well have been an intent, but it is not expressed, and moreover there is no right to assert except in the case of an individual, that the States cannot assert a Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1100.483,1101.905,How about an ambassador?
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1101.905,1103.806,I don't believe so.
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.806,1107.188,"An ambassador is not an individual, then, in your view."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1107.188,1114.875,"Your Honor, I would have to review the Seventh Amendment again, but I don't think that is the intent behind that provision."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.75,1215.022,"Well, that doesn't necessarily follow."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1229.544,1261.003,"Your Honor, I think that comes back to the question of is it the Senate's sole power to decide what is the content, or is it this Court's power to say what the law is, to construe the law, and I think an impeachment, just as in questions of the viability of a commission to be a magistrate of the District of Columbia, this Court must exercise jurisdiction, must review the question in the absence of anything that denies jurisdiction or in the absence of any indication that there are no judiciable standards to apply."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.003,1265.698,"Well, you are running a slippery slope kind of an argument... if trial doesn't mean anything, where does it end?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1283.033,1293.569,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so, because we have attempted to provide the line we think needs to be applied here, which is the trial is the opportunity to present witnesses and to confront witnesses."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.949,1294.069,And what if--
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1294.069,1294.48,--Excuse me.
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.48,1297.072,--What if there's a mistake made so that one element is not there?
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1301.346,1303.356,I don't understand.
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.578,1304.858,You know harmless error.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1304.858,1305.829,--The admission of hearsay--
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.829,1308.201,"Well, whatever."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1325.474,1328.095,"--Your Honor, I think there has--"
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.095,1332.347,"Now, if you say there's a harmless error rule, I'm going to say, well then we have to evaluate the weight of the evidence, don't we?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1333.078,1334.359,--I wasn't going to say that.
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1335.45,1337.103,So there's no harmless error rule at all.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1337.103,1338.154,I appreciate being helped.
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.154,1339.366,"The slightest mistake, and the whole thing goes out."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1339.366,1346.93,"Well, that's like if there was a two-thirds requirement and they're only one vote short of two-thirds, does this Court say well gee, they were awful close?"
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.633,1358.799,"What about applying the confrontation clause to the admission of hearsay... you know, various exceptions to the hearsay rule?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1364.204,1376.612,"No, Your Honor, I do not think that admissibility questions like that, whether... one of the impeachment trials in 1986 involved papers that were... the argument was that they were improperly seized."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.612,1380.885,But failure to allow cross-examination is raisable in your view.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1380.885,1383.097,"I think that is the irreducible requirement, yes, sir."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.097,1387.27,What about an undue shortening of cross-examination?
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1387.27,1392.374,"Your Honor, that is the point at which you would have to have a court look at the question."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.645,1436.793,"The two-thirds majority, you would have witnesses in the chamber who would... I mean, is it only what... you said before, if it appears in the record that there is not a... why does it have to appear in the record?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1447.752,1453.845,"Well, no, I think there would be certainly be an obligation on defense counsel to call to the attention of the court... the Senate--"
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1453.845,1454.036,Right.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1454.036,1456.567,--As a court that there is the absence of a quorum.
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.567,1457.538,"Yes, but the Senate ignores it."
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1458.028,1461.452,"If the Senate is so reckless as to ignore it, and it is stated--"
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.452,1463.495,--Then you'd come to us with your affidavits and say there was not a quorum.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1463.495,1464.984,"--We state it on the record, yes, sir."
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.984,1471.469,And we're going to judge whether there was a quorum in the Senate on the basis of affidavits provided by your witnesses.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1471.469,1476.354,One of the virtues of the video age we're in is that the Senate proceedings are now televised.
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1485.871,1489.214,"Well, actually, you don't come to us, you come to the district court--"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1489.214,1489.384,"Yes, sir."
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1489.384,1501.551,"--And then to the court of appeals, and then to this Court, and in the case, say, of an impeachment of the President, that could go on easily 21/2 years, I should think, probably 3--"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1501.551,1502.993,"Your Honor, that's--"
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1502.993,1519.383,--And I think you ought to address the argument that the Solicitor General makes that this would put this Nation at grave risk in the event of an impeachment of the President that was winding its way through the courts on judicial review.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1519.383,1522.015,"--Your Honor, you pose a very difficult question."
1992.91-740,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1547.284,1549.317,But it's not just the delay.
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1564.578,1578.279,"--Your Honor, I think the most pernicious effect on the Constitution and on the history of this country would be if this Court would simply... and the courts in general simply avert their eyes from an unconstitutional impeachment and surely an unconstitutional impeachment--"
1992.91-740,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.279,1600.882,"Mr. Stewart, don't you think that Framers who had enough foresight to provide for original jurisdiction by this Court in cases involving ambassadors, in cases involving the States, would also have had enough foresight to provide for original jurisdiction by this Court if they thought that the courts were being able to review at least impeachments of the President?"
1992.91-740,0,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1614.425,1615.997,"--Your Honor, I don't think so."
1992.91-740,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.853,1640.674,"Very well, Mr. Stewart."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1642.967,1646.688,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-740,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1701.265,1703.597,Are the committee hearings part of the trial?
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1703.597,1704.228,Yes.
1992.91-740,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1704.228,1712.061,Then I take it if the President were impeached and a committee was sitting the chief justice would preside over the committee.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1712.061,1715.565,"It is very possible that that would be the case, but I think--"
1992.91-740,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1715.565,1717.638,"Well, he would have to if it's part of the trial, wouldn't he?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1717.638,1721.457,"--I think that is quite arguably the case, Justice Kennedy."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.128,1822.223,"But General Starr, when that rule was adopted in 1904 according to your opponent here it was contemplated that it would be voluntary on the part of the person being impeached, and indeed, maybe many of them would prefer to be tried by 12 Senators who were there than by 100 who weren't, so one can see why that would have some attraction."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1822.223,1830.6,"Justice Scalia, it's fair to say that the Senate was not of one mind with respect to the constitutionality of Rule XI."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.152,2097.999,"Well, we could issue a stay pending appeal, General Starr, I guess, right... a stay or removal pending appeal, or something like that?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2097.999,2104.314,"You have the raw power to do that, but I don't think that it would be a constitutional act."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.314,2106.234,"Who would we direct that to, the Senate?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2106.234,2109.436,It seems to me--
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.436,2110.668,I assume the removal is automatic.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2114.491,2118.335,"--I think that is right, because the judgment is what removes."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.572,2154.829,I notice in the recent district court there has been a district court judgment reversing an impeachment of another judge--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2154.829,2155.848,--Precisely.
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.848,2158.78,--And the end of the judgment was that the case is remanded to the Senate.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2158.78,2160.472,That is correct.
1992.91-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.791,2232.552,"May I ask, General Starr, do you think the Senate or the House could have impeached a judge and merely recited the fact that he had been convicted of a crime and that was the ground of impeachment and then the evidence of that be sufficient before the Senate to remove him?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2232.552,2234.063,"Yes, I do--"
1992.91-740,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.063,2237.925,So you think all of this was process and may not have even been necessary.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2237.925,2261.052,"--I think it was not necessary, but I think, Justice Stevens, that clearly a majority of the Senators did feel... and I know Mr. Stewart's position is that there is a constitutional right to a separate proceeding that must involve a sense of what the evidence was in the case, and that's the sober judgment of the Senators."
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.715,2288.161,--you say the Senate would have the power just to impeach based on a criminal conviction.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2288.161,2288.949,To convict.
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2367.313,2367.954,"That may well be, General Starr."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2374.148,2374.889,That's correct.
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.889,2377.811,They could have impeached him for poisoning a neighbor's cat--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2377.811,2379.073,That is correct.
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.073,2381.965,--And called that a high crime and misdemeanor and you'd say that's good enough for you--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2381.965,2383.223,That's correct.
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.223,2385.026,--And there could have not been a quorum present.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2387.848,2394.142,We'd have to accept... I think this Court's decisions in Ballin and Field v. Clark say we accept the records of the Senate.
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.795,2398.396,--Suppose it's clear on the records of the Senate that there was not a quorum present?
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2398.396,2401.067,--I think that the judgment still stands.
1992.91-740,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2403.461,2404.46,What if--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2404.46,2406.302,--Possible arena of Powell v. McCormack.
1992.91-740,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2406.302,2413.858,--What if the record shows that there was not a vote of two-thirds of the Senate to convict?
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2413.858,2424.857,"We think that as long as the records themselves are being accepted, that it does seem to us that we are in the arena of Powell v. McCormack at that stage."
1992.91-740,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2451.184,2453.905,So in your view that might be justiciable.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2453.905,2454.166,Yes.
1992.91-740,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2454.166,2467.456,"Is the claim before us today... should we treat it as nonjusticiable, or just committed by the text to the discretion of the Senate?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2467.456,2491.951,"The former because of the latter, that the text itself, when we also contemplate the structure of the Constitution and the purpose of impeachment in our system of separated powers, that it does satisfy, it seems to us, at a minimum two of the criteria laid down by this Court in Baker v. Carr, a textual commitment to the Senate."
1992.91-740,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2508.454,2518.15,So you do want us to rule that the question of the meaning of trial is textually committed to the Senate.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2518.15,2518.431,--Yes.
1992.91-740,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2518.431,2519.652,You do want us to rule--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2519.652,2528.589,"Yes, we do, but even if... and this Court has struggled, as have we and others, with the political question doctrine."
1992.91-740,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2555.067,2564.071,"--That leaves open the two-thirds vote, the quorum and all those other issues, for future litigation, then."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2564.071,2565.293,It does indeed.
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2666.012,2679.964,"I suppose that at least what the Senate... the procedure the Senate might adopt, I suppose they would have to call it a trial, wouldn't they?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2679.964,2688.608,"--It seems to me... they might have to call it a trial in one sense, but Justice White, here's the reason I'm struggling with that."
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.73,2700.025,"Well, whatever it meant, they have to be able to... they have to fit it within the word try."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2700.025,2701.397,--They have to fit it within the word try.
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.857,2746.968,"So if the Senate has a rule... had a rule that anyone who's been convicted, any Federal officer who's been convicted of a felony, and the judgment is final, we just automatically... he is automatically guilty."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2761.089,2767.081,"Because you use the word automatic, it concerns me as to whether there, Justice White, is that examination as a judge."
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.566,2791.018,"So if they did that, that in your view would be judicially reviewable."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2791.018,2799.835,"It might be in terms of whether there was an examination at all, whether the Senate was examining as a judge, but it might be."
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2824.852,2833.578,And those procedures that you refer to as having been entrusted to the Senate are in other words those which are not necessarily implied by the word trial itself.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2833.578,2846.395,"That's correct, because as we've noted in our brief, Rufus King, one of the delegates who also served on the Committee of Style, referred to the President and members of the legislature being tried by their electors--"
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2846.395,2846.976,What if we took--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2846.976,2847.787,--A judgment... I'm sorry.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2847.787,2848.278,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2887.544,2894.06,"If I concede that... I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow the language."
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2894.06,2909.94,"Would you concede that we would have a judiciable... the courts would have a judiciable controversy here if, 1) we concluded as a matter of law the trial implied the reception of evidence directly by the findings of fact?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2909.94,2910.08,No.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2910.291,2911.312,You would not concede that.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2911.312,2926.824,"I would not concede that, because it seems to me that... and now I'm going to be formalistic, and that is I'm going to rely on the sole... the grant of that sole power to try, it seems to me, carries with it the interpretive power to determine what the procedures are going to be."
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2926.824,2927.324,But--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2927.324,2928.193,But... sorry.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2928.193,2934.558,"--Why, then, don't you say the same thing with respect to the interpretive power to determine what is a two-third majority?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2941.424,2945.878,It seems to me that we are in two structurally different domains.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2952.342,2952.572,Right.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2952.572,2954.004,--And sit in judgment.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2954.004,2955.634,"Could I just short-circuit this, maybe make this simpler--"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2955.634,2955.804,Yes.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2955.804,2956.676,--Than I started out to make it.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2965.351,2965.661,Yes.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2965.661,2971.866,"Now, do you concede that because that is an issue of fact which is easily resolved?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2971.866,2972.337,No.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2972.337,2972.928,Why?
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2974.24,2974.39,No.
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3030.859,3033.28,"So it's a difference in emphasis, then."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3033.28,3034.222,It's the fact--
1992.91-740,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3034.222,3061.499,"If, for example... if I varied my example and said trial not only means the... not only requires the presence of all the fact-finders but they had said trial, parenthesis, at which of course all Members of the Senate will be present, end paren, you would find there had not been such a commitment to the Senate simply by virtue of the emphasis on that requirement and the need to enforce it somehow beyond the Senate itself."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3061.499,3074.739,"--You're using the term emphasis, and without trying to quibble, I'm trying to say, Justice Souter, that I am emphasizing the fact that the text itself specifically defines what the majority is."
1992.91-740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.158,3144.328,General Starr--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3144.328,3144.558,"Yes, I'm sorry."
1992.91-740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.558,3156.266,"--Supposing that during an impeachment trial of the Senate the chief justice dies, and the Senate says well, there's by statute created the office of vice chief justice."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3165.131,3165.952,This is the impeachment of the President.
1992.91-740,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3165.952,3167.484,The impeachment of the President.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3181.275,3193.994,"It seems to me that under our theory I have to admit that if the chief justice, whoever it be, he or she, the acting chief justice is not in the Chair, then that is judicially reviewable."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.994,3194.973,You have to admit--
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3205.271,3209.732,I think it is a most appropriate first question--
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3209.732,3210.433,"Well, I know, but--"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3210.433,3211.424,"--To answer, and yet--"
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.424,3212.355,--Jurisdictional?
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3212.355,3217.288,"--I don't think it divests you of... I think you have jurisdiction, obviously, to decide that, but the most--"
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.288,3232.94,"So you think it would be proper to say, well we assume judiciability without deciding it, but we think the Senate clearly had the power to do what it did."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3232.94,3260.108,"--It seems to me that while you're not drained of jurisdiction to do that, in terms of the appropriateness of the exercise of the judicial power, if in fact the matter has been entrusted to another branch, then it seems to me that it is part of your duty to resolve that question first as opposed to saying that is such a difficult question, but it's actually easy for us when we move to the merits to say this is a perfectly sensible procedure."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3270.844,3280.251,"General Starr, if I understand your theory, you're quite right trial does not have a precise content, but surely it has some content."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3293.823,3294.444,Yes.

1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3298.765,3299.967,"Yes, it is, under--"
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.967,3302.568,"What is not a trial, in your view?"
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3304.25,3317.749,"--I suggest a difficulty with the automatic rule that we're not going to consider anything at all because we have an automatic rule which we're going to apply, because it does seem to me that the term try means that you're coming to judgment, but yes, if you--"
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3317.749,3332.337,"I think it's an artificial system you're setting up when you say two-thirds has a meaning and chief justice shall preside has a meaning, oath or affirmation has a meaning, but trial has no meaning whatever."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3335.59,3342.384,"--I think it does... I'm sorry, in the abstract, of course it has meaning, but who's going to give content to the meaning in our view is the Senate."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3342.384,3342.565,At the margins.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3345.798,3347.948,"But Justice Scalia, my point is this."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3357.094,3362.359,"I may agree with that, but I would say the same about the chief justice presiding, about the two-thirds, and all the rest of it as well."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3362.359,3366.303,"--Well, that's fine, if you want to view that as nonjudiciable, that's fine."
1992.91-740,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3368.816,3372.567,"Well, I just don't see any logical basis for drawing a line between the two."
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3372.567,3378.832,"--If I may say so with all respect, that may be the difficulty that you're having with Powell v. McCormack as opposed to our submission."

1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3391.161,3392.292,Absolutely.
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.498,3414.017,So the House could impeach saying the judge is a bad guy and the Senate could take a vote without any trial or anything else and say... they unanimously say the judge is a bad guy.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3414.017,3420.772,"Justice White, my theory has to... leads me to answer that question yes."
1992.91-740,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3420.772,3421.083,Yes.
1992.91-740,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3421.083,3438.334,"But will you permit me also to say that will not happen, and we saw that, by the way, in 1986, when there was a hue and cry by virtue of the decision of the 11th Circuit in the infamous Allday case, and thoughtful consideration was given by the House of Representatives... I'm sorry."

1992.91-740,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3538.362,3539.683,"--That is not reversible, Your Honor."
1992.91-740,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3539.683,3540.604,It is not reversible.
1992.91-740,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3549.46,3555.435,"And of course, Your Honor, we're not saying that the Senator's reasons for voting are subject to review by this Court."
1992.91-740,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3564.254,3567.907,"But you're saying they can't draw straws or flip a coin, but we can."
1992.91-740,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3567.907,3570.22,We are not going to the decision.
