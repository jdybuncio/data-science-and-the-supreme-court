1975.75-145,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.348,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-145, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe against William Hollowbreast and others."
1975.75-145,0,41168,steven_chestnut,,18.019,19.861,Thank you Your Honor.
1975.75-145,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,85.355,98.124,"First Mr. Chestnut, a good deal depends on how you word the question when you say that all that was done in 1926 was to announce a plan, you pretty much answered the question in your favor, do not you?"
1975.75-145,0,41168,steven_chestnut,,98.124,99.628,"Well, I think that is a fair reading of --"
1975.75-145,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,99.628,112.726,"But if you ask the question, if you put it in terms of what the statute actually said then the question becomes at least a question, at least a difficult question, does it not?"
1975.75-145,0,41168,steven_chestnut,,112.726,113.303,"Well, I think the statute actually --"
1975.75-145,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,113.303,116.106,"Statute did not say, we hereby announce a plan."
1975.75-145,0,41168,steven_chestnut,,116.106,118.601,"No, it did not use the word plan, that’s true Your Honor."
1975.75-145,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,118.601,120.629,It used the word ‘become’.
1975.75-145,0,41168,steven_chestnut,,120.629,121.23,That is right.
1975.75-145,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,127.498,133.5,"That shall mutually has some bigger meaning than just an announcement, does it not?"
1975.75-145,0,41168,steven_chestnut,,133.5,149.166,"Well, it can be taken as a term of in futuro and I think that when you take it with the following word ‘become’, I think it is pretty clear that the intent was that the property right would come into existence in 50 years."
1975.75-145,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,150.195,152.748,"It has a mandate in it, is that what you are saying?"
1975.75-145,0,41168,steven_chestnut,,152.748,187.987,"No, I think it has a -- it connotes the concept of future, a future event and I think moreover that the circumstances giving rise to the Act and the legislative history of the Act and the subsequent administrate execution of the Act, more or less contemporaneous with its enactment subsequent to, but contemporaneous clearly show that the full understanding of the statute, by the administrators charged with the duty of enforcing it and by the legislators who enacted it, was that no property right was then being created and I will go into that into my argument."
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2092.606,2097.051,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-145,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.59,2127.793,"The 68 amendment is not unconstitutional because by its very term, it is inoperative, is it not, if the Court should decide that there was a Property interest created in 1926?"
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2127.793,2132.543,"Well, the way it causes was it where it was if they found it to have a vested interest which would have make the government liability --"
1975.75-145,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.543,2134.45,"Well, then it would be viably null and void."
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2134.45,2136.657,Right.
1975.75-145,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.657,2153.158,"Also if Congress proceeded to simply take it from the allottees, the allottees remedy is only to sue in the Court of Claims for compensation as I understand the law that they cannot say that the Act would have not effect."
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2153.158,2161.425,"That is why the Section 2 I believe of the 68 Act was put in there, which specifically required the Tribe to bring this suit and required title in the minerals."
1975.75-145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.977,2186.959,Do you think that intent is of greater weight than the intent in 1961.
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2198.205,2201.174,That is not before the Court; it is not at issue in this case.
1975.75-145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2201.174,2205.587,But do you think it is relevant evidence of Congressional intent in 1926?
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2215.976,2224.872,The 61 amendment did not divest the allottees of their interest.
1975.75-145,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2224.872,2231.882,"Did the 61 amendment do, had to do with the timber, did it not?"
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2231.882,2233.211,There are several of them --
1975.75-145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.211,2241.859,"Well for one thing it specifically operates as I recall it, the allottees to grant -- that is the Tribe to grand leases of duration greater than 50 years."
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2241.859,2242.487,Right.
1975.75-145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2242.487,2247.867,Now is that consistent with the ownership in the allottees after that period?
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2247.867,2252.882,"Not if they were to give the allottees their royalties, I presume once their state became possessory."
1975.75-145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.702,2268.752,Let me put it this way.
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2274.766,2284.509,"Right, but there are constitutional problems under the 61 Act in broadening the class of people who are eligible and included, I believe devisees, the other ones had to do."
1975.75-145,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.275,2306.562,"The thrust of my question is not to get into a debate about 61 Act, but I am just wondering the extent to which it is appropriate to look at either the 61 Act or the 68 Act when we were trying to identify the congressional intent in 1926."
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2306.562,2318.257,"Well, I am not really that familiar with the history of the 61 amendment, however the 68 amendment was considerable concern with the prospect of divesting this interest."
1975.75-145,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2331.631,2337.637,"If the soul inquiry in this case is what congress did or did not do in 1926, is it not?"
1975.75-145,1,41081,steven_l_bunch,,2337.637,2338.597,"Right, right."
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3133.376,3137.977,Mr. Chief Justice and may please the Court.
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3295.747,3298.543,That is one of the 1868.
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3298.543,3299.61,Yes sir.
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3299.61,3304.295,The Battle of the Little Bighorn was 1878 or 76?
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3304.295,3306.655,I am speaking of the Battle of Washita.
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3306.655,3309.313,"No, but I am asking you about the --"
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3309.313,3310.039,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3311.895,3315.161,But the Battle of the Little Bighorn was when?
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3315.161,3316.858,1876.
1975.75-145,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3316.858,3317.953,"June 14th, 1876."
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3317.953,3320.379,"June 25th, 1876."
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3320.379,3324.525,"And the Northern Cheyenne were involved in that, are they not?"
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3324.525,3350.956,"Yes sir, but that came after the slaughter of Washita came three months following the proclamation of the treaty and they had not yet had an opportunity to select their lands, and it was after that, that Colonel Custer then went to the Black Hills on that expedition, which final resulted in the Battle of the Bighorn in 1876."
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3350.956,3354.26,And that was the a few miles west of where this Reservation is.
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3354.26,3355.427,Yes sir.
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3355.427,3356.668,Very close and very near.
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3356.668,3357.832,Yes sir.
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3379.348,3380.713,Tongue River get in here?
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3380.713,3389.097,The Tongue River is on the Cheyenne Reservation Your Honor at presently and I believe it was also mentioned there.
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3546.01,3547.407,How do those figures evolve?
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3562.306,3569.426,Because the original surface of the Reservation was divided that way.
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3572.141,3574.859,Only 38% of the surface was ever allotted to them.
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3574.859,3575.653,Yes sir.
1975.75-145,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3577.032,3578.434,Is that your representation?
1975.75-145,2,34118,lewis_e_brueggemann,,3578.434,3580.709,Yes sir.
1975.75-145,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3798.996,3799.846,Thank you gentlemen.
