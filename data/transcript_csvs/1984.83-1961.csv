1984.83-1961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.974,"Mr. Quarles, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,12.974,16.526,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,184.769,196.41,"Mr. Quarles, I suppose the form the transaction took was largely guided by tax reasons, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,196.41,201.331,There was no... as to my clients there was no choice involved.
1984.83-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,210.753,212.037,Rather than the assets--
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,212.037,212.622,That is correct.
1984.83-1961,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,212.622,215.491,"--Had it been of the assets, I suppose we wouldn't be here today."
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,215.491,219.359,"I'm not certain that that's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1961,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,681.607,690.113,"Mr. Quarles, do you think that United Housing Foundation against Forman was incorrectly decided by the Court?"
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,690.113,693.165,On the facts of that case I do not.
1984.83-1961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.336,1394.188,May I just interrupt with one question?
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,1413.149,1425.909,"I would say that 10(b)(5) and its requirements would apply, as this Court has held, in private, face-to-face negotiations as well as in negotiations which occur over the national--"
1984.83-1961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.909,1434.848,And in every case in which any warranty in a contract with respect to the financial condition of the company is alleged to have been misleading or breached in some respect.
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,1434.848,1441.519,"--Upon a demonstration of the proof of the requisite scienter and the other requirements of 10(b)(5), that would be correct."
1984.83-1961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.519,1448.406,"Would it be co-extensive with common law fraud actions and breach of contract, or a little broader, I suppose?"
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,1448.406,1451.124,"It is substantially different, Your Honor."
1984.83-1961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.553,1496.005,But you still have your state common law action which you--
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,1496.005,1510.229,Washington... this Court said just two terms ago in Huddleston and McLean that the burden of proof upon a defrauded purchaser is preponderance of the evidence.
1984.83-1961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.577,1536.646,--Do you think there's anything in the legislative history that shows Congress thought it was giving federal jurisdiction for a suit like this?
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,1536.646,1537.046,Yes.
1984.83-1961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.935,1568.568,You rely on the interstate advertising and all that.
1984.83-1961,0,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,1576.123,1580.509,My case would be the same since they would have used an instrumentality of interstate commerce.
1984.83-1961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1664.595,1666.164,"Very well, Mr. Quarles."
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,1670.833,1677.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1961,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2025.544,2036.583,"Well, Mr. Smith, I guess Congress did decide to include private transactions within the coverage of the anti-fraud provisions, didn't it?"
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2036.583,2037.852,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2054.545,2061.9,"Somewhere in your argument you will discuss the effect of your position on the Williams Act, I take it?"
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2061.9,2077.06,"Well, the Williams Act which, as the Court is well aware, applies to tender offers, I submit evidences a very particular congressional intent to protect persons, non-sellers or investors in a tender offer situation."
1984.83-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2100.423,2102.108,Or 100 percent.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2102.108,2102.825,--Yes.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.835,2287.424,"May I ask just to be sure I follow it as you go through, does that mean that you would agree there was a security if they had sold 40 percent of the company to these people."
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2287.424,2292.912,"--What it means is I would agree that there was a common enterprise and that that requirement would be satisfied, Justice Stevens."
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.912,2296.197,Does it further mean you would agree there was a security in that event?
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2296.197,2310.04,"It means that the district court would have to take a very hard look whether that purchaser objectively, not subjective reliance but objectively under the circumstances of this particular case acquired control sufficient--"
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.04,2311.024,I said 40 percent.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2317.027,2317.427,--Yes.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.427,2320.412,"Would that be a covered transaction, in your view?"
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2320.412,2324.883,The test would be whether or not the purchaser obtained control over the outcome of the investment.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.883,2325.516,You're saying he didn't.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2328.085,2329.787,"Oh, in that instance I would say no."
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.887,2332.739,You would say it was not a covered transaction.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2332.739,2333.439,Yes.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.439,2336.957,"But if he sold 60 percent, it would have been a covered transaction."
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2336.957,2337.524,I'm sorry.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.69,2340.207,"I thought you did, too."
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2340.207,2342.326,If the purchaser obtained 60 percent--
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.326,2342.776,No.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2346.546,2346.88,--Yes.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.88,2349.063,And the seller retains the remaining 60 percent.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2349.063,2349.582,Yes.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.582,2350.848,Is the transaction covered or not?
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2350.848,2351.598,I believe so.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.598,2352.015,It is?
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2352.015,2352.417,Yes.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.417,2355.485,But it's not covered if he gets 51 percent.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2355.485,2362.405,Depending upon whether that 51 percent under the circumstances of the case provided actual control of the purchase.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.691,2372.595,"But if it was a 40 percent price, we are clear that would be a security and all the economic realities would satisfy your standard."
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2372.595,2378.099,Unless there was some sort of unique veto power or authority to run the business given to the purchaser.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.099,2379.017,No gimmicks.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2379.017,2380.384,Thank you.
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2382.803,2383.369,No.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2387.105,2398.995,"--I'd like to turn for a minute to the record below, because I think this Court should be quite clear what case it has before it, and I'm not sure it's the case as described by petitioner."
1984.83-1961,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2777.259,2787.9,"Do you think Forman, the opinion in Forman was influenced by the nature of what was sold and its utility?"
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2787.9,2790.15,"I truly think not, Chief Justice."
1984.83-1961,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2790.15,2793.452,"It wasn't a sawmill type of an operation, was it?"
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2793.452,2796.654,"That's correct, and it was a very unusual instrument."
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.118,2874.339,"Mr. Smith, may I ask you another question, just thinking of a little different kind of case?"
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2898.121,2908.827,"Well, as I said earlier, Justice Stevens, I think when we get into publicly traded stock, in all candor, there is an interest exhibited by Congress in the '33 and '34 acts that--"
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2908.827,2912.179,So your argument really doesn't apply to publicly traded securities at all.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2912.179,2918.95,"--Conceptually the logic's identical, but I think there might be good reasons that this Court should decide to draw the line with private transactions."
1984.83-1961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2918.95,2921.902,I see.
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,2921.902,2930.592,"Now, there's something else about this Howey test, this economic realities test which I submit is very important in the Court's resolution of this case."
1984.83-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3111.024,3114.309,Why didn't you insist on an assets transaction... tax purposes?
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,3114.309,3123.848,"I think... quite admittedly, Your Honor, I think in the negotiations my client wanted for tax reasons to have it be a stock transaction."
1984.83-1961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3123.848,3126.549,"Usually the seller does, and the buyer wants the assets."
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,3126.549,3127.283,Yes.
1984.83-1961,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3199.477,3210.499,"Well, don't you think that ten cases on this subject with five each way apparently has been a burden on the federal courts that was avoidable if there had been a single rule?"
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,3210.499,3211.535,--I certainly do.
1984.83-1961,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.318,3216.587,"So the time has come for us to make a single rule, hasn't it?"
1984.83-1961,1,32814,james_a_smith_jr,,3216.587,3219.622,It certainly has.
1984.83-1961,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3224.593,3227.461,"Do you have two minutes remaining, Mr. Quarles."
1984.83-1961,2,32489,james_linwood_quarles_iii,,3230.913,3231.949,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.83-1961,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3366.451,3367.084,"Thank you, gentlemen."
