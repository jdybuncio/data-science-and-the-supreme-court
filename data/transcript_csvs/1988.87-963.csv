1988.87-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.824,"We'll near argument next in No. 87-963, Robert Hernandez v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and 87-1616, Graham v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,16.426,24.948,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.397,128.866,"He did say ""generally"" in that quote that you read, didn't he, in that first sentence?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,128.866,131.635,"He did say generally, Your Honor."
1988.87-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.737,168.76,"Well, Mr. Graetz, what flexibility does the IRS have to change its view in its regulations from time to time?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,178.032,197.593,"Justice O'Connor, this Court has in numerous opinions expressed that in the tax law there is a need for clarity, particularity, predictability, and special deference to the IRS."
1988.87-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.289,299.776,"Well, Mr. Graetz, even if we accent your approach to the deductibility for auditing, what about training?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,304.196,309.464,"Well, Your Honor, I... let me, let me respond in two ways."
1988.87-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.122,321.808,"And tuition isn't deductible, is it?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,321.808,322.824,--It's not deductible.
1988.87-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.824,326.343,"Why should it be, why should payments be deductible for training?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,326.343,330.914,"Well, the Court below did not distinguish auditing and training."
1988.87-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.526,379.811,But you concede there may be a basis for making that distinction?
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,379.811,396.106,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that the only basis that I, that I can see in the record for making that distinction is where the training is undertaken for the purpose of, of becoming a minister, that is of employment."
1988.87-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.651,422.424,Would the deductibility of tuition at a theology school be dependent on whether you want to be a minister when you get through?
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,422.424,423.407,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.87-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.222,499.924,Excuse me.
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,510.945,520.67,"The finding of fact and the stipulations are that with respect to auditing, there is no educational component."
1988.87-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.866,568.318,"One can study a sacred text without, without worshiping."
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,581.959,608.609,"No, Your Honor, and all, all that we are asking is that, that religious observances, the conduct of religious worship, which is a phrase that appears In the Internal Revenue Code regulations numerous times, is not the sort of quo... to use the government's repetitive phrase of quid pro quo... is not the sort of quo that will disqualify charitable contribution deductions."
1988.87-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.773,786.593,"Well, the arrangement, the arrangement here was for a fixed sum to be paid, wasn't it?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,786.593,790.045,"--The arrangement in this case was for a fixed sum to be paid, yes."
1988.87-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.045,791.128,How does that come about?
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,804.721,821.564,"There is a schedule, a schedule based on the hours of worship, where the payment is set by the church and the people who participate make that payment."
1988.87-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.516,823.582,So the--
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,829.086,838.109,"Well again, Your Honor, I... the payments are set on an hourly basis, and the payments are fixed."
1988.87-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.82,871.33,"So for all practical purposes, worshiping in this church is not permitted except upon paying a certain sum every time you worship?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,871.33,877.334,"--Well, Your Honor, there are a number of free services that are given by this church."
1988.87-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.007,893.112,"And you say that that's... if you want to worship you have to pay, and therefore you certainly should be able to deduct it."
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,894.278,916.607,"My argument is that, that the fixed and mandatory nature of the payment has never before been held to be crucial in determining whether or not a charitable deduction is or is not allowable, that in a case of secular education it doesn't matter whether the payment is voluntary or set by the, set in accordance with discussions."
1988.87-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.9,962.688,"So if a church says, well, we'll let you become a member of our church if you promise every year from now on to contribute $10,000."
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,972.711,973.128,No.
1988.87-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,997.31,999.595,"Well, what's the record of the IRS in that?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1003.915,1009.919,"Well, Chief Justice, the record of the IRS is in dispute."
1988.87-963,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.509,1020.325,But they certainly have been deducted.
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1020.325,1031.15,"--They certainly have been deducted and it is very hard to imagine that, that the participants of that religion would nave never challenged in court the disallowance of those, of those deductions."
1988.87-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1082.082,1084.201,Annual clues to a church?
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1084.201,1086.153,"That's what the ruling says, Your Honor."
1988.87-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.153,1088.136,And it didn't go into any further detail?
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1089.855,1098.461,"Well, it, it describes both of those rulings, the 1919 ruling and the 1970 ruling that reaffirmed that ruling, describes certain fundraising practices."
1988.87-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.567,1113.137,"--But, there were pew rents in Roman Catholic churches, and in some other churches."
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1113.137,1116.256,"Well, it had declined in significance."
1988.87-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.826,1141.388,"May I ask you to comment on the government's response to, say, the, your analogy to the tags stipends that, in that case and in some of the others that you've mentioned, the quo, what is received in exchange is not merely received by the person who donates the money or contributes the money but is received by the congregation at large."
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1150.91,1171.823,"Well, it's, it's not a valid distinction, Justice Stevens, because in this religion, like all religions, it is, and it is clearly in the record, that this religion believes that, that the proselytization and conversion of people to this religion will serve mankind, in much the same way that other religions do."
1988.87-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.179,1183.048,"Well, that's the point."
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1183.781,1193.737,"Well, but Your Honor, the Internal Revenue code does not distinguish payments made to religions based on whether they worship individually or whether they worship congregationally."
1988.87-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.737,1203.243,"Well, no, but there is a difference between making a donation that benefits a large group of people on the one hand, if you benefit an entire congregation, and making a donation that just... you get the sole immediate benefit."
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1203.243,1205.027,"Well, but, let me give you two other examples--"
1988.87-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.027,1207.01,Let me follow up with one other question I'm unclear about.
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1212.264,1219.204,"--They have, they have physical buildings at which there are meetings of, of the members of the faith, yes."
1988.87-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.893,1236.999,"Are the group meetings attended by just the general members of the church, or the executives, or the hierarchy, or what are the nature of the group meetings?"
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1236.999,1248.204,"Well, there's not... in the record, since these payments in this case were for the individualized, individual services, the record doesn't get into detail about the nature at group meetings."
1988.87-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.204,1250.973,Does it tell us whether they have any church buildings?
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1250.973,1252.508,"Yes, there are church buildings."
1988.87-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.508,1254.475,And they call them churches?
1988.87-963,0,35899,michael_j_graetz,,1254.475,1255.727,"Yes, they do call them churches."
1988.87-963,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1638.534,1645.772,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice... excuse me."
1988.87-963,2,35899,michael_j_graetz,,3305.961,3307.744,May it please the Court.
