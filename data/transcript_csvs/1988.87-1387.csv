1988.87-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.547,"We will hear argument next in Number 87-1387, Wards Cove Packing Company v. Frank Atonio."
1988.87-1387,0,20856,douglas_m_fryer,,61.492,64.934,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.998,157.253,"You say, Mr. Fryer, that your labor market analysis is approved by the EEOC."
1988.87-1387,0,20856,douglas_m_fryer,,161.457,168.881,The labor market analysis was based upon the one percent sample from the Census.
1988.87-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.892,200.862,"Well, Mr. Fryer, I gather the district court relied on your expert's suggestion of just using Census data for a very wide area of the Pacific Northwest--"
1988.87-1387,0,20856,douglas_m_fryer,,200.862,201.503,That is correct.
1988.87-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.503,203.015,--as the relevant labor market?
1988.87-1387,0,20856,douglas_m_fryer,,203.015,203.793,That is correct.
1988.87-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.793,225.819,"Now, the Ninth Circuit rejected that and relied upon the pool of workers... the cannery workers themselves... and a more restricted pool and said that was determinative, is that correct?"
1988.87-1387,0,20856,douglas_m_fryer,,225.819,226.51,That is correct.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1557.781,1561.683,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1387,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1605.583,1607.464,What is the number of employees?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1607.464,1610.014,The total number of employees?
1988.87-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.555,1679.72,"Your opponent says that that is because the cannery is seasonal, hired on the spot, and that the others aren't."
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1679.72,1684.414,They all hired for seasonal work.
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.536,1740.43,"Well, the residents of Ekuk, how are they broken up by minority status?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1740.43,1742.741,How are they broken up?
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.741,1743.252,Yes.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1743.252,1746.535,The primary minority group at Ekuk is Alaskan native.
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1750.288,1751.827,"Well, that seems reasonable to me."
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1765.117,1765.596,Right.
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.596,1775.583,"Because a lot of the people are hired locally, but then you tell me that the people available to be hired locally are also minority people, not Filipinos, but Alaskan natives."
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1775.583,1777.132,That is correct.
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.833,1778.514,But why is that good for you?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1779.726,1780.245,--Why is that good?
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.245,1786.459,I mean it seems to me that this employer is doing what a reasonable employer would do... he hires who is available to be hired.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1786.459,1804.442,"The difference, Your Honor, is that this employer hires, in cannery worker jobs, virtually all non-whites and has other departments that pay more, substantially more, sometimes three or four times more than cannery worker jobs, that are almost all white."
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.904,1808.275,Are there such skilled people available in Ekuk or these other towns?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1810.485,1811.106,"--There are, absolutely."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.86,1853.575,"Well, does the plaintiff have the burden of establishing the appropriate labor market from which the employer must do the hiring for the jobs at issue?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1853.575,1854.313,No.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1854.313,1857.084,Who has that burden?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1857.084,1862.09,"First of all, if I can, I would like to try to explain how I am going to use these terms."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1866.121,1866.691,Yes.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1866.691,1867.272,Okay.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1874.358,1882.513,"Yes, and the district court accepted as the relevant labor market, the whole Pacific Northwest, using Census data figures?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1882.513,1892.579,"Right, and we contend that that finding was induced by three errors of law, and, as a result, is clearly erroneous."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1925.461,1933.467,"Well, you may have a separate status claim under that section for housing, or feeding, or something, but we are talking about hiring, primarily, aren't we?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1933.467,1934.397,"Yes, we are."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1934.397,1938.289,Hiring in certain higher paying jobs?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1938.289,1938.86,Right.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.86,1939.939,That is what is at issue?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1939.939,1940.459,Right.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.459,1947.536,"And to decide that, you think we don't... that the Court doesn't have to establish a relevant labor market to look at the figures?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1947.536,1948.424,Not in all instances.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1950.147,1953.2,"Well, doesn't the Court have to do it here for the hiring problem?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1953.2,1953.821,--No.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1959.584,1964.667,Look just at the cannery worker and other worker pool and nothing else?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1964.667,1965.738,Yes.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1969.268,1977.184,"Well, why is that appropriate, if, in fact, the employer hires from a broader area and says, the market, in fact, is from a broader area?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,1977.184,1986.521,"--Perhaps I misspoke, when I said that it can confine its examination, I meant to the work force... namely those hired, rather than those around the cannery."
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.015,1992.465,I don't see that Mr. Arditi.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2012.96,2016.621,"Yes, I would like to explain what I understand that phrase to mean."
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.697,2039.248,Right.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2039.248,2049.222,"If it meant something more, then we would have a situation where the phrase, because of which might suggest intentional discrimination, means something, in fact, different in those two sections."
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.222,2057.727,"No, but still in all, to establish that the classification has been because of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, you have to get to labor market."
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2077.112,2081.184,Perhaps I could emphasize the fact that this is a very unique industry.
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.595,2150.559,"Couldn't have anything to do with better transportation now, than was the case in 1905?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2156.604,2158.023,I think that it has very little to do with that.
1988.87-1387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.204,2193.867,--Maybe minorities were unduly favored in prior times.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2203.324,2206.356,"Well, no doubt that they found that they did."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.741,2246.291,"Mr. Arditi, what if we disagree with the Ninth Circuit's look at just the labor force of this employer as the source of the employees, perspectively?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2249.794,2267.275,"It would be possible for the Court to vacate the finding and remand for additional findings in light of the five factors mentioned in Hazelwood, which the district court here, did not consider."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2267.275,2274.64,And Hazelwood does contemplate the location of a market from which employees can be drawn?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2274.64,2275.321,"Yes, it does."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2300.967,2303.198,The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service studies?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2303.198,2303.669,--Yes.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2303.669,2305.329,That ended in 1955.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2305.329,2315.978,"It ended in '55, and then for the later years, we offered statistics on a sample of those employed in the industry through 1978."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2322.402,2324.403,As long as I have you interrupted--
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2324.403,2324.834,Sure.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2324.834,2328.955,"--This was presented mostly as a hiring claim, wasn't it?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2328.955,2330.177,Hiring and promotion.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2332.427,2339.102,"Well, what do we do with these housing and feeding allegations?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2345.236,2346.598,They were tried under both--
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.598,2351.29,"Now, are they presented and were they presented as separate status claims of some kind?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2351.29,2351.731,--Yes.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2351.731,2352.7,"So, regardless of hiring?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2352.7,2353.381,Yes.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2353.381,2356.513,You still pursue those as status claims?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2356.513,2358.464,Absolutely and fringe benefit claims.
1988.87-1387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.464,2362.578,"On, the labor market question."
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2381.621,2393.168,"Well, I would say that, but I don't think I can also just simply say that is not a business necessity finding."
1988.87-1387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2393.168,2405.487,"Well, but you don't get to business necessity until you get to the relevant market and isn't this the trial court's finding of fact that bears on the relevant market?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2405.487,2409.06,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1988.87-1387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2410.482,2412.562,He did not make that finding for that purpose?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2412.562,2418.327,--I am not sure what purpose he made it for.
1988.87-1387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2428.694,2439.73,"Well, that whole finding, that whole series of findings, plus this one specifically, is directed at describing the general labor force, by which he means the general labor market."
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2439.73,2442.702,That... that may be.
1988.87-1387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2449.127,2452.748,"But there is ample evidence to support that finding, is there not?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2452.748,2461.584,"No, there is no finding at all about the skill level of people in these villages, except the fact that many of them do have ample boating and fishing experience."
1988.87-1387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2464.077,2465.488,Did you challenge that finding in the Ninth Circuit?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2465.488,2469.84,--I am sure we did.
1988.87-1387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.882,2476.984,"Well, then it must be a market... relevant market finding."
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2476.984,2486.2,"--Well, the reason that I say it is not a business necessity finding is that the district court never reached the issue of separate hiring channels on disparate impact grounds."
1988.87-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2498.909,2502.573,"Well, are you now claiming that this finding is clearly erroneous?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2504.744,2512.657,"--Well, what I am arguing to the Court is that it is not a finding that is couched in business necessity."
1988.87-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2512.657,2516.43,"Well, I asked you if you are now arguing to us that that finding is clearly erroneous?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2517.891,2521.243,Yes.
1988.87-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.296,2525.137,You are arguing that to us?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2525.137,2543.119,"Well, Your Honor, what I would like to do is perhaps try to explain the fact that there are many at-issue jobs, upper-level jobs that even the district court found were unskilled, and so, we are not dealing in all cases with scouring a remote area."
1988.87-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.119,2544.778,How many at-issue jobs are you talking about?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2544.778,2546.1,That were unskilled?
1988.87-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.1,2553.574,"No, no, just how, how many at issue jobs... how many non-cannery workers are there in one of these canneries?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2553.574,2557.868,I would say there are approximately 30 at-issue job titles.
1988.87-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.952,2568.234,"Well, are there as many non-cannery workers as cannery workers?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2568.234,2569.085,No.
1988.87-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.085,2570.795,Maybe half or what?
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2572.357,2573.338,"Roughly, yes."
1988.87-1387,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.338,2574.237,--All right.
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2574.237,2580.111,"Beyond that, we are not asking that the employers be required to scour these areas."
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2612.954,2624.641,"Well, I thought that the findings of the district court showed that upon application at the proper time, that the employer did consider and receive and hire people who had been cannery workers?"
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2624.641,2633.566,I don't think the district court made a specific finding on considering and hiring cannery workers.
1988.87-1387,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2637.72,2641.232,"I thought its findings covered that, for instance, Mr. Antonio, himself."
1988.87-1387,1,15419,abraham_a_arditi,,2641.232,2644.693,--Mr. Antonio made several applications.
1988.87-1387,2,20856,douglas_m_fryer,,3291.251,3292.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1387,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.591,3312.963,Do you think that the employer just has the burden of production or a burden of proof?
1988.87-1387,2,20856,douglas_m_fryer,,3312.963,3317.618,You don't have to decide that In this case.
1988.87-1387,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.618,3318.977,I didn't ask you that.
1988.87-1387,2,20856,douglas_m_fryer,,3318.977,3327.393,"All right, our position is that it depends on the strengths of the plaintiff's evidence, in a nutshell."
