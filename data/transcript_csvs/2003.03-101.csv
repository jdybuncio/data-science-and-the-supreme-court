2003.03-101,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,34.487,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-101, Gale Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.673,12.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-101,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,81.201,83.634,"Well, can... can we talk about that for a minute?"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,155.349,159.617,"Well, what you're describing, either regulations or, for example, a land management plan--"
2003.03-101,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.617,160.267,--Right.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,160.267,163.855,--of the sort at issue here... we... we agree that that is final agency action.
2003.03-101,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,169.573,173.894,"Well, boy, I... I think you... I think you're out of the frying pan into the fire."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,197.842,201.211,--Just because something is final agency action doesn't mean it's ripe for judicial review.
2003.03-101,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.157,251.044,"Well, this... the case has sort of a hodgepodge of things in it."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,274.826,275.776,It--
2003.03-101,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.776,282.015,--and another to engage in a separate study as a precursor to the off-road vehicle thing.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,289.686,290.002,--No.
2003.03-101,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,317.003,318.455,To make a separate study?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,318.455,328.227,"Well, to... to monitor and to... and then it contemplated that the area might be closed if the monitoring showed adverse consequences."
2003.03-101,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.631,338.602,"When you say monitor, what... what does the BLM look for when it monitors an area?"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,338.602,356.48,"Well, it... someone from the BLM office would go out to the area to look to see whether there's been an increase in, let's say, off-road vehicle use, to... to inspect whether there's been additional adverse consequences, to see... to perhaps watch how people are using the area."
2003.03-101,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.484,374.708,"Well, how about the other one, that the BLM has to finish its off-road vehicle use designation rulemaking by 1992?"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,374.708,378.744,--That... that's not actually a... a formal rulemaking.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,413.983,415.869,Why isn't that a defense?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,446.138,454.56,"Well, with... with respect to the... to the actions under the plan here, which I should emphasize are just one minor aspect of the broader challenge here--"
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,454.56,456.393,Those were the two that I... I know--
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,456.393,456.71,--Right.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,457.36,457.943,--What about those two?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,458.41,458.893,--No.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,458.893,465.047,"--in black and white, you said, dah, dah, dah, and you didn't and... and therefore we want to go into court and make sure you do."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,467.915,468.549,Well--
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,468.549,470.549,And you make a defense it doesn't say that.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,470.549,491.697,"--they... they have and what... the court of appeals in this case held that based on a provision of FLPMA, which says that management actions shall be in conformity with the land use plan, that that statutory provision obligates the Bureau of Land Management to carry out every activity identified in the plan."
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,512.878,519.281,"Even if they're wrong about that, I thought there's a basic principle: an agency has to follow its own rules."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,519.281,520.248,But these... these--
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,520.248,522.216,So they say... they say here is a rule.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,541.028,541.547,--Yes.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.547,541.93,Okay.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,543.497,547.015,Because land... a land management plan is something quite different from a regulation.
2003.03-101,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,565.578,566.828,But why... why isn't that simply a defense?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,591.044,606.804,"Well, I... I think it is the plaintiff's burden under a suit... in a suit under 706(1) to establish that there is discrete agency action that has... that is... that the agency is obligated to the plaintiff to take and has not taken."
2003.03-101,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,610.222,613.79,"In the... in the lower court, you didn't join the motion to dismiss."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,617.425,617.777,--No.
2003.03-101,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,635.071,641.227,But that would go to the relief or... or to the... whether they have a... a claim for relief.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,643.093,655.05,"--But... but it also... it... it went to whether the district court should enter a preliminary injunction in the first... if... if there was no basis under 706(1) for the court to entertain the case, that would certainly be a basis for denying the preliminary injunction."
2003.03-101,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.05,658.938,I... I don't understand this discussion of jurisdiction.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,663.656,664.023,No.
2003.03-101,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.556,666.675,--You're saying there's no cause of action.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,667.342,669.46,--But it's... the cause of action does not lie under 706(1)--
2003.03-101,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.46,669.894,Okay.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,671.429,671.912,"--Right, but--"
2003.03-101,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.912,673.312,You acknowledge they can come into court.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,673.312,673.781,--Right.
2003.03-101,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.414,675.114,"But the judge should say, get out of here."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,675.764,694.777,"--The district court termed it jurisdiction, but it... but it... it I think probably more accurately would be characterized as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because there was no final agency action that BLM was obligated, owed a duty to the private plaintiffs to take under its land management plans."
2003.03-101,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,695.611,709.871,"--Well, do you take the position that no land use management plan can ever give rise to an obligation to any portion of the public to do certain things that the plan says will be done by date X?"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,709.871,716.875,"--We're... we're not saying it would be legally impossible for BLM to impose such a thing on itself, but BLM has never--"
2003.03-101,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.875,720.643,"If it did, is it actionable possibly?"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,720.643,726.464,"--It... it might be, but that would depend on how the plan... the particular plan was worded."
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,735.586,758.868,"Well, I thought you acknowledged that it... that it imposes some legal duties; that is to say, that if... if the agency took action, took affirmative action, which would destroy its ability to follow through on the plan, you know, allowed development in a certain area that the plan anticipated would be left undeveloped, that an injunction would lie for that."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,760.054,764.589,But... but if I could explain the way that would operate.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,775.813,776.346,Right.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,776.346,781.233,BLM could not... or the Forest Service could not allow timber harvesting within 200 feet of a stream.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,789.656,790.773,Suppose... suppose it's--
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,793.675,812.522,"The... the protect the stream would be a standard against which a timber sale, a discrete agency action, that takes place on the land governed by the plans, would be measured, but it is not itself a legal duty of the sort that is compelled under... that can be compelled under 706(1)."
2003.03-101,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,812.522,817.39,"Would... would you go back to monitoring for a minute, which may be easier to understand than the plan?"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,843.058,843.408,No.
2003.03-101,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,844.558,846.493,Because it's not final agency action?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,846.493,847.243,--It's not final agency action.
2003.03-101,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,847.243,862.435,"So it... it's really not... going back to the... the earlier argument about the plan, what is fatal, it take it, is not that the... the duties are... are, in effect, precatory duties that they don't have hard-edged enforcement features."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,871.477,872.127,There... there are two points.
2003.03-101,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.666,887.57,"But you acknowledge that they could, that some details of some plans could impose--"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,887.57,897.175,"What... what I would acknowledge would be that if BLM chose in the future to adopt a policy of putting such things in plans, it would probably have the authority to do so."
2003.03-101,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,898.944,904.412,"--But it would still, I take it, on your argument not be... raise an issue of final agency action."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,907.633,909.5,"With respect to monitoring, that's true."
2003.03-101,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,909.5,910.05,"No, no."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,936.383,937.066,Not across the board.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.431,970.437,Why... why wouldn't a... a... the adoption of a policy saying that we will never monitor be final agency action with respect to the duty to monitor?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,970.437,972.806,--Because monitoring itself is not final agency action.
2003.03-101,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,976.358,992.034,"Mr. Kneedler, the... Judge McKay in the Tenth Circuit, dissenting in the Tenth Circuit, described these land use plans as aspirational and that's why he thought that they weren't open to private enforcement."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1000.823,1003.325,That's basically our position.
2003.03-101,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.367,1025.421,Could... could I come back to the... to the no harvesting timber within 200... 200 yards of a stream?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1030.558,1031.075,--Yes.
2003.03-101,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.533,1044.652,What... what does it have to say?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1053.072,1054.108,--I think--
2003.03-101,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.108,1055.891,--land use plans are all aspirations?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1055.891,1056.46,--No.
2003.03-101,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.376,1058.026,Where does it say that?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1058.026,1067.065,"--I... I think with future management activities, it's... I... the general rule, certainly I think the universal rule, is that those are aspirational."
2003.03-101,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1149.302,1156.991,"Suppose there were the world convention of ORV's and 100,000 people are going to come into the area."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1161.21,1162.443,"Well, what... no."
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1180.239,1181.707,"Well, do they have to do that?"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1191.346,1193.664,There... there are two points to that.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.126,1210.426,Okay.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1215.428,1216.197,Again--
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1216.197,1218.097,It doesn't... doesn't even say I will deny your order.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1218.816,1224.534,"--If the... if the agency doesn't respond, a suit could be brought under 706(1) to compel the agency to respond."
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1228.087,1230.071,"Well, is the response final?"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1232.839,1233.473,--Yes.
2003.03-101,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1273.531,1283.656,"Mr. Kneedler, if you... the complaint here was that the agency wasn't doing anything or not enough about off-the-road vehicles."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1319.077,1333.403,"Well, in... in two of the wilderness study areas, in the San Rafael and in the Parunuweap, BLM issued orders closing some roads within those areas but not... leaving others open."
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.859,1344.211,Relying on what?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1344.211,1348.496,Under section 706(2) of the APA.
2003.03-101,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1348.496,1353.567,"No, but I mean, what... what provision of law that would... would have required them to close--"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1353.567,1371.528,I think the argument would have been that it was... that it would have been arbitrary and capricious or that not to close it would... would not meet the... the general statutory standard that wilderness study areas... that the Secretary shall manage wilderness study areas so as not to impair their suitability for ultimate designation as wilderness.
2003.03-101,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.929,1401.631,--May... may I go back to the two specific things that are described in the papers here?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1412.605,1413.838,That's one of our arguments.
2003.03-101,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.838,1416.89,But is not the duty to monitor final agency action?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1431.217,1431.817,No.
2003.03-101,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.485,1437.987,"If the statute required a specific monitoring and they just didn't do it, that would not be--"
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1437.987,1446.659,"--Congress could impose a duty on an agency to do a number of things that would not, in turn, constitute final agency action."
2003.03-101,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.146,1452.696,--What... what about the failure to do it?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1455.932,1456.384,No.
2003.03-101,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.75,1460.186,--promulgate rules and they do nothing?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1460.186,1463.221,"--Well, a rule would be final agency action."
2003.03-101,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1463.221,1467.573,"Well, suppose it's... what Congress is you must, no matter what, promulgate by March 10... it's exactly Justice Scalia's question... 1994 this tentative, non-reviewable, never-to-be-reviewed preliminary draft of a vague plan X."
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1504.365,1504.915,No.
2003.03-101,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1510.352,1511.702,You... you don't agree with my statement.
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1519.808,1525.445,--The... the review occurs under the APA and the APA is limited to final agency action.
2003.03-101,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1525.445,1528.313,What is your best argument for your tandem point?
2003.03-101,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1532.432,1536.836,Agency action is used in both 706(1) and 706(2).
2003.03-101,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.592,1574.627,"Very well, Mr. Kneedler."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1576.511,1583.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-101,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.565,1623.925,"Mr. Smith, let's go to the appendix, page 162, which I believe is one of the things that the Tenth Circuit dealt with: apply ORV designation documents; through ORV implementation, et cetera."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1634.598,1634.964,--No.
2003.03-101,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1658.313,1664.883,"Well, supposing in... on page 162 instead of saying within 1 year, they had said within 12 years."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1669.621,1674.508,"--If they had said that they were going to do it in 12 years, we wouldn't have had any claim that they were doing it too late."
2003.03-101,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.508,1677.793,So... so there's nothing statutory in the deadline you're talking about.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1681.261,1687.232,And the statutory argument is that the statute itself requires them to manage these lands in accordance with their own plans.
2003.03-101,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1687.698,1691.534,But... but there's nothing in the statute that requires them to set deadlines.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1691.534,1693.636,"--Not in... not in this case, Your Honor."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.681,1721.571,"Mr. Smith, can I... I... your opening statement was that it's implausible that there should be some duties upon agencies that are not enforceable in the courts."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1772.171,1785.146,"Well, Your Honor, what makes their... their position implausible is what Congress actually did in the Administrative Procedure Act where it very specifically said that... that courts have the power to compel agency action unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.146,1804.059,"It's based... nobody thought that the APA radically changed the course of... of judicial review of administrative action, which had been based on the prerogative writs such as mandamus and which required an individual right that had been harmed and... and a mandatory duty to that individual."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1804.059,1804.859,And... and--
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.859,1818.367,"And one can violate the... the directives of Congress without... without harming any individual, and when that happens, it's up to the congressional committees to bring the agency back into compliance, not... not these courts."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1818.367,1825.406,"--With respect, Your Honor, I think the concept that decides who gets to bring the lawsuit is the concept of standing, not the concept of individual rights."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.667,1879.689,I think all the Government is saying is that the inaction like the action has to be inaction which causes remediable harm to the individual.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1879.689,1880.373,Absolutely.
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.373,1893.181,"Just as that doesn't happen with action unless it's final, the Government says it doesn't happen with inaction... with inaction unless what you're seeking to compel is something that would have conferred upon you something you have a right to have."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1893.181,1894.633,"Well, two points, Your Honor."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.516,1923.485,Let's take the Federal Communications Commission.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1943.097,1944.299,"No, Your Honor."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.285,1951.402,How do we determine what's sufficiently general?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1955.773,1964.379,"Well, Your Honor, what you do is you... you apply the usual techniques of statutory construction and then you look at the second thing, which I think it's important that we... the... the Court focus on here."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.683,2000.818,Was that a regulation?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2003.17,2005.872,It was promulgated based on notice and comment.
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.61,2017.245,Doesn't it have to appear in the C.F.R. if the agency regards it as a regulation?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2017.245,2020.264,"--The... I don't know the answer that there's a specific rule about that, Your Honor."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.264,2020.799,I think it is.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2020.799,2030.338,"It is certainly the... the document by which the BLM has committed to guide all of its actions with respect to this category of land, the wilderness study areas, and it's been consistently enforced by courts."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.338,2036.324,"No, but something that just... just determines internal actions of an agency is not... is not regarded as a regulation."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2036.324,2047.181,The other regulation that I think is important for the Court to focus on is the regulation dealing with what they're supposed to do when they find impairment caused by off-road vehicles.
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.119,2055.469,Where is that in the joint appendix?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2055.469,2056.603,"It is not in the joint appendix, Your Honor."
2003.03-101,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2109.854,2111.89,Isn't it slightly more difficult than that?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2158.287,2166.377,"Well, the... the regulation not only says that's... that's what you... that's what triggers it, but then it says specifically what they're supposed to do, which is to close the whole area, including the--"
2003.03-101,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2166.377,2167.143,If it's considerable.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2167.143,2167.56,--Yes.
2003.03-101,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2167.56,2171.829,"Not... not if there's... you know, one track through the desert is not, I presume, enough."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2171.829,2172.28,Right.
2003.03-101,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2173.047,2176.648,The criterion then that you'd plead is there is considerable.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2180.25,2180.75,--Right.
2003.03-101,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2198.495,2198.912,--Okay.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2203.632,2204.149,Well--
2003.03-101,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2204.149,2205.834,--before just filing a lawsuit?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2205.834,2213.487,"--Your Honor, there is no procedure that the BLM has for filing a petition or for doing anything to trigger any kind of a response."
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.545,2231.901,"Well, I thought you could... I thought the land use plan has the status under the statute as a rule... as a rule, and there is a procedure."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2237.639,2241.024,"Your Honor, there is no place to go get a docket number and get any answer."
2003.03-101,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2245.193,2246.176,You didn't wait for an answer.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2251.963,2257.516,"--Well, those letters were part of an ongoing effort over a period of many years to try to get them to take this problem."
2003.03-101,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2257.516,2268.241,"But you didn't... you... the... one difficulty that I have putting a handle on it is... is you're saying, agency, overall you're not enforcing the statute."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2299.462,2322.809,"Well, Your Honor, we... we brought a lawsuit that encompassed potentially a... a substantial number of these different wilderness study areas and related areas, but then what... what happened is we made a motion for a preliminary injunction as to four and put on evidence showing the adverse effects in those four and asked the court to... to address them and say they're... they're not... they're not adhering to their statutory and regulatory obligations in those four."
2003.03-101,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2336.485,2349.728,"But if you petitioned for an action, that is, you asked the agency to close this area, and they said no, it seems to me that that would be a final action."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2349.728,2351.061,"--But they don't say no, Your Honor."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.001,2365.421,Then... then you bring an action to require them to say yes or no.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2380.78,2393.138,"Well... well, perhaps, Your Honor, but then you end up with an entire set of litigation over how many... how much time it is before they have to answer each particular petition without any kind of statutory or regulatory guidance of how that process is supposed to work."
2003.03-101,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2393.138,2406.148,But this seems in a way like sort of the shortcut to say we... we demand that the BLM comply with its statutory mandate and we don't like the way they're doing it.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2408.767,2410.767,"Well, it's... it's not, though, Your Honor."
2003.03-101,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2436.167,2448.492,It's so hard for courts to get into the business of trying to see if an agency like this is out there on a day-to-day basis doing what it needs to do.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2448.492,2452.677,"--Well, it's not... it's not like we're trying to take over running the agency, Your Honor."
2003.03-101,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.677,2460.199,"Well, but it... it sounds that way to a certain extent, like kind of the court taking over a prison where they find there's some defect."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2477.161,2484.982,"Well, there is obviously going to have to be some application of judicial review and then some application of... of the court's power to enforce the law."
2003.03-101,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2490.486,2497.574,Or maybe some application could be made seeking closure of some areas.
2003.03-101,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2503.145,2505.261,"--Well, the... the evidence was quite clear."
2003.03-101,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2507.53,2508.33,It looks pretty terrible.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2508.33,2516.786,"Indeed, on... on page 59 of the... the appendix to the op to cert, the Government flat admitted that there had been impairment."
2003.03-101,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2524.225,2532.313,So is there no mechanism whereby suit could be brought demanding that a certain area be closed because of the impairment?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2532.313,2533.831,"Your Honor, that's what this suit was."
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.831,2538.117,"Why didn't you go... look, are we supposed to concentrate on the four areas?"
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2538.117,2540.568,"Well, that's the only part that's before the Court on that issue."
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.568,2541.101,"Right, those four areas."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2555.261,2555.794,We're not--
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2555.794,2563.35,"Or are you saying that the land use plan permits them in part to be open, but we want... we think they should be closed?"
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2565.469,2569.504,"--At the time the lawsuit was brought, there was no BLM plan or--"
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.504,2569.854,No.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2596.238,2598.707,--It depends on whether you mean now or--
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2598.707,2601.559,I mean as we're supposed to decide this case.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2601.559,2609.415,"--The difficulty, Your Honor, is that after the lawsuit was brought and as the preliminary injunction hearing was about to convene, the Government started exercising the exact emergency--"
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2609.415,2610.431,I want you to choose.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2640.934,2649.723,"--When the case was brought, there was no closure order in place, and we were told by the district court that there is no jurisdiction of the Federal courts to require that."
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.11,2657.979,That's... but I'm asking you how I should decide it.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2664.149,2664.732,--Yes.
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2664.732,2665.501,That's your view.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2678.142,2682.444,We... we want an exercise of the emergency closure which would effectively amount to the same thing.
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2682.444,2682.844,Okay.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2721.385,2734.21,"Your Honor, if I could refer you to page 52 of the appendix to our opposition to cert... that's the orange document I guess... this is what we did file with them, seeking the closure of these WSA's."
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.876,2795.933,"So if in fact this is the equivalent of the kind of document I said, then why wouldn't your lawsuit be to compel them to act on this request in a timely fashion?"
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2805.973,2808.758,"Well, this lawsuit was designed to ask them to do that."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.995,2814.629,"Yes, yes."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2827.22,2833.992,--But it may well be that the Court will recognize that all agencies have to respond to these things and you can sue them.
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.414,2845.616,You don't need that to get into court.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2860.543,2866.447,"Well, it may well be then that... that once that's clarified, that this whole dispute will... will be a matter of procedural--"
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2866.447,2867.464,But it's been clear.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2910.743,2913.678,"--Well, there... there is not a lot of case law about continuing supervision."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.748,2920.731,In a discrete matter.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2933.406,2938.293,"--Well, I'm not sure that there's really a distinction between the two kinds of lawsuits that we're contemplating here."
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2961.841,2962.375,Exactly.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2967.779,2970.347,"Who don't apparently fall in either category, Your Honor?"
2003.03-101,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.085,2987.976,"But it isn't totally just... because what they're worried about is not that you're trying to get off-road vehicles off the road in certain areas like here, there, and the other place."
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3000.966,3002.152,"--Well, that's one of the things they're worried about."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.662,3018.445,Why is that unreasonable?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3037.408,3037.692,No.
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3038.276,3041.46,"--as opposed to, you know, all of these other things that need the money for it?"
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3041.46,3046.597,"--The rule would be they have to go through the amendment process, and there... then you have an agency action which you can challenge."
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.041,3063.174,How... how can they amend it?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3102.018,3102.418,"--No, Your Honor--"
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.418,3103.468,And that doesn't seem reasonable.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3103.468,3110.172,--The way that that gets handled in the... in the run of the mine cases in... in the D.C. Circuit and elsewhere is at the... at the point of equitable discretion.
2003.03-101,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3158.521,3169.643,But how could the judge look at it without knowing all the other things that are on the agency's table given the limited resources?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3190.14,3196.128,"They... they may well be... put that... that argument forward, if and when we ever have a hearing on this thing."
2003.03-101,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3201.732,3208.72,"I mean, if... if we imagine coming into court, then would everything that's on the agency's plate have to be presented to the court?"
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3208.72,3212.572,It would depend on the particular duty at issue and the kinds of harms that are at issue.
2003.03-101,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.584,3283.851,That happens all the time under statutes.
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3304.032,3318.592,"Well, that's a perfect example, Your Honor, of why this issue only arises in certain narrow circumstances because the FCC takes affirmative agency actions all the time and you can challenge those as being arbitrary and capricious and outside the statutory requirements."
2003.03-101,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3333.351,3341.29,Is... is one way to characterize what the Government is saying is that they require that every inaction has some sort of a mirror image in action?
2003.03-101,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,3344.159,3344.626,--Right.
