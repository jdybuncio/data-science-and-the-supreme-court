1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.539,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 961, New York Telephone Company against the New York State Department of Labor."
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,15.539,16.222,Mr. Chief Justice --
1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,16.222,20.947,"Benetar, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,20.947,24.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.031,275.468,Mr. Benetar.
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,275.468,276.342,Sorry.
1978.77-961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.342,284.054,Would your position be the same if this were unemployment benefits for a lock out that was called by the employer?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,284.054,291.151,"I think that on principle, the position would have to be the same."
1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,323.095,333.365,"Would you think the same would be true of the welfare payments, which are financed by the taxpayers generally rather than the employer?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,333.365,336.503,"No, I would not sir, I would not."
1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,336.916,344.281,How does it differ and that is -- how does it differ in its impact on the neutrality principle that you were discussing?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,344.281,361.475,"In a few ways, and what happened in this case sort of dramatizes the difference, because with 33,000 workers who collected unemployment compensation and 1,000 who applied for welfare."
1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,417.343,422.157,"But its impact, how do you distinguish its impact on the neutrality principle?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,422.157,437.666,"Well, it may -- well, in our case, as Your Honor can see from the figures, the impacts of welfare and unemployment insurance were nowhere nearly equal."
1978.77-961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.367,501.882,"Mr. Benetar, to distinguish welfare, what would you do if you had unemployment compensation financed by the state, $49 million paid by the state, instead of the employer?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,501.882,503.044,If it was what?
1978.77-961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,503.044,509.355,"If it was financed by the state for general revenues rather than by the employer, would your case be different?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,509.355,517.918,It would be different but not in any way basically ordered.
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,702.308,702.691,Tell me --
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,702.691,703.733,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall?"
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,703.733,708.877,What is the fundamental change between 35 and now?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,711.176,712.823,Between 1935 and now?
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,712.823,713.631,Yes sir.
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,713.631,715.967,"Yes, in the New York law, do you mean?"
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,715.967,722.638,"No sir, in the whole factual situation, it said that there's more money involved."
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,722.638,723.979,"Well, there are changes --"
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.979,732.901,"But the relationship between New York and the labor market, and the Federal Government and the labor market, is the same as there was in '35, is it not?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,732.901,741.554,"Well, not entirely, because in '35, we were in the -- as Your Honor remembers, we were in a deep depression."
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,741.554,746.189,"Well, what is this we're in now?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,746.189,762.89,"Well, the president has characterized it otherwise, and I think that -- I think that all of us feel that regardless of the untoward events that had been happening to us, this is not a deep depression."
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.89,766.507,"Well, I'm not selling apples yet."
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,766.507,771.261,"No, well and the threat is inimminent, for any of us, we don't feel it the same way."
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,771.261,778.208,"No, that means seriously the relationship, this whole point was considered in '35."
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,778.208,778.681,The point that I'm making?
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,778.681,779.998,It's understood.
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,779.998,784.31,"No sir, with all deference, I would answer you --"
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,784.31,788.915,It wasn't understood that the management would pick up this bill?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,788.915,789.717,No sir.
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,789.717,790.496,That wasn't understood in '35?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,790.496,791.897,"No sir, no."
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,791.897,792.975,"Well, what was understood in '35?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,792.975,800.161,"In 1935, there was no experience rating under the New York law."
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.412,813.359,"All right, so '36?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,813.359,814.551,Or '37.
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.551,814.575,Or '37?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,814.575,816.635,I'm not sure of the date.
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,821.958,822.168,Was what year?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,822.168,829.018,-- through experience rating was at least ten years later and maybe more.
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,829.018,831.856,"And in that way, ever since?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,831.856,832.725,It has been that way ever since.
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,832.725,836.192,And Congress has known it?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,836.192,838.557,"Well, Congress has known it as a concept --"
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,838.557,841.282,Have you bothered to let Congress know it?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,841.282,842.204,I beg your pardon?
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,842.204,846.396,Have you bothered to let Congress know it?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,846.396,849.803,"Well, I haven't --"
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,849.803,852.492,Or is your client --
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,852.492,862.276,"I'm not aware that they have done so, because we are of the belief that this doesn't require any further congressional action."
1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,882.529,888.368,"In your view, Mr. Benetar, what could Congress do about the statute of the State of New York?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,888.368,889.111,What should it do?
1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,889.111,890.392,What could it do?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,893.985,894.308,"Well, I think that --"
1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,894.308,896.974,-- that New York State has provided?
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,896.974,934.133,"I think that the Congress would have the right to change the concept of neutrality, but I don't think that they would, could or would do that without measuring the effect of so drastic and invasion of the forbidden area under one hand with the desire if there was one on New York's part to keep using unemployment compensation as a vehicle for paying out money, not on a basis of needs."
1978.77-961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.282,1202.539,"Mr. Benetar, what percent of the wages that a person earns is paid by unemployment compensation?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,1202.539,1203.97,Up to 50%.
1978.77-961,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.97,1204.419,I beg your pardon.
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,1204.419,1207.773,Up to 50% tax free.
1978.77-961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.746,1300.219,"But at that time, Mr. Benetar, had the rule of neutrality ever really been discussed by Congress?Wasn't that something that Court found a few years later?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,1300.219,1316.419,"Well, I think that the rule of neutrality, of course, was discerned and laid down by this Court, and I presume that this Court discernment went to the question of what Congress intended in the first place by it?"
1978.77-961,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.126,1321.713,"But there isn't much legislative history discussing the rule of neutrality, is there?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,1321.713,1344.252,"Well, but the legislative history summarized in Lockridge, says that Congress acted because of the perceived inability of the states to handle these problems in a uniform coherent manner and to balance the respective equities or strengths of the parties."
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1498.784,1502.647,"The Second Circuit relied on that very case, didn't it?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,1502.647,1503.21,I'm sorry Mr. Justice --
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1503.21,1510.21,"The Second Circuit's opinion in this case relied on the Lodge '76 case, did it not?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,1510.21,1514.342,"Well, if they did I don't recall they're citing Lodge '76."
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.511,1595.936,It is that I knew that's why I asked the question.
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,1595.936,1598.272,"Well, I simply want to do confirm --"
1978.77-961,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1598.272,1600.332,"Well, what's your view of it?"
1978.77-961,0,20599,david_d_benetar,,1600.332,1615.955,"Well, my view of it is that the area below was compounded by their recognition of the principle without giving an effect, that's my view of it."
1978.77-961,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1817.134,1818.296,Very well.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,1827.422,1829.452,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2143.703,2143.817,"Well, the supremacy --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2143.817,2149.589,"Well, pre-emption generally is a constitutional principle stemming from the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, isn't it?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2149.589,2154.882,"It becomes a constitutional matter by virtue of the fact that if the two laws are inconsistent, --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2154.882,2155.571,The federal law prevails.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2155.571,2159.697,"--then the federal law is stronger, but what the Court -- I believe what this Court --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2159.697,2162.056,"And that's because of the Constitution of the United States, specifically the Supremacy Clause?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2162.056,2178.434,"Right, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, but this what this Court meant in stating, directly stating, and I'm quoting from the decision of that pre-emption is not a constitutional principle, it simply meant that the idea of not having the states in the field at all is not part of the pre-emption concept."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2323.2,2329.811,"Now, you say as though that statement followed from what you told us, it doesn't seem to me that it does."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2329.811,2340.918,"Well, from the very beginning, they had what was a strong and flat out recommendation by the very group that was the impetus for the passage of the law."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2350.937,2352.099,"Well, what were those restrictions?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2352.099,2366.015,"Those restrictions for example were that if a worker refused to seek new work, to accept new work at a struck job that he couldn't be denied unemployment benefits."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2366.494,2369.773,"That if he failed to seek new work he could be denied, that's what you mean?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2369.773,2378.315,"Well, in other words, the question as to what kind of new work, under all unemployment plans, under all state laws, a person is obliged to seek other work."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2378.315,2379.507,To seek new comfortable work.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2379.507,2379.98,Right.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2379.98,2380.22,Yeah.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2380.22,2393.777,"And the -- what Congress want to make sure of is that the state didn't say to this worker, you've got a possible job, you can go and work at X plant, which is being struck by its employees."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2394.849,2395.412,"Yeah, right."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2395.412,2401.993,You can't deny benefits to somebody because they refuse to work for an employer who was involved in a labor controversy.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2401.993,2403.095,Right.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2403.095,2412.969,And the other restrictions involved such things as not permitting denial of benefits for somebody who refused to work for less than the prevailing wage in an area.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2412.969,2414.107,Right.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2414.107,2419.251,And refused to join a place where they were not allowed to be union members.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2437.209,2438.347,To prevent any state plans from allowing --
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2438.347,2440.227,To prevent any state plan --
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2440.227,2440.431,--on employment compensation to strikers.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2440.431,2446.653,-- from paying under the various options that already exist from paying unemployment compensation.
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.797,2473.203,"To the extent that Congress required the states to pay unemployment compensation to an unemployed person who refused to cross a picket line, they did then insert themselves in a certain extent into the or perhaps a better way to put it is, they required the states to insert themselves into the economic warfare."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2473.203,2490.952,"Yes, they certainly were thinking along the lines that the President's Committee asked them to think along and what they said was we will put this restriction on the states, but we will not put down the flat restrictions that the President's Committee asked us to do."
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.754,2507.383,"Well, they moved the other way from the recommendation of the President's Committee."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2507.383,2507.886,Yes.
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2507.886,2511.443,"But, they moved only a slight way."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2511.443,2513.144,"Yes, that's correct."
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2645.424,2649.436,But the labor disputes under that are governed by the Railway Labor Act?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2649.436,2680.005,"Yes, they are and while there are some differences in the structure, this Court pointed out in Locomotive Engineers versus Baltimore and Ohio that those differences go to the beginning of the labor dispute, where there are various mediation provisions which must be followed, but that once those initial stages are over, the parties are in the same position as they are under the NLRA, self-helped and collective bargaining."
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2684.287,2697.425,"But one of them that you've just point out that's quite different is that Congress requires the payment of benefit -- unemployment benefits to striking railroad workers, whereas it doesn't to striking workers in other areas."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2697.425,2701.581,"It does not require them Your Honor, but it permits them under the plan of the --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.581,2702.413,"Well, that's the issue in this case."
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.413,2703.132,"Yeah, that's the issue in this."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2703.132,2704.084,Yes it is.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2872.662,2875.979,How many states do pay benefits?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2875.979,2877.027,"Well, the vast majority of states --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2877.027,2878.734,But then it was your brief but I haven't read that for a long time.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2878.734,2885.524,"Yes, the vast majority of states Your Honor do pay under a variety of different schemes."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2906.117,2910.938,How many pay just indiscriminately to any economic strike?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2910.938,2916.531,"Well, I don't know of -- either they have the provision that we have, which provides a suspension period --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2916.531,2918.172,"A waiting period, a waiting period, yes."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2918.172,2928.256,"-- which eliminates the vast bulk of strikes from consideration altogether or they fix on particular circumstances under which the benefits should be paid, either --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2928.256,2931.543,"Well, that -- my question was how many do not fix on particular circumstances?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2931.543,2932.921,"In other words, how many like New York's law and have the suspension period."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2932.921,2936.119,"Like New York, which perhaps with a waiting period, but otherwise this condition."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2936.119,2940.155,"Rhode Island and possibly the Virgin Islands, but Rhode Island has a --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2940.155,2940.927,Rhode Island?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2940.927,2941.766,"Yes, has our --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2941.766,2942.089,And New York.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2942.089,2944.065,-- suspension period approach.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2944.065,2945.112,Right.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2945.112,2946.251,Which eliminates the vast majority of strikes.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2946.251,2949.724,And Hawaii had that -- if the employer stays in business with 80% of this.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2949.724,2960.083,"Correct, that Hawaii has the same kind of statute as this Court upheld in the Kimbell case, that is if the employer continues in substantial operation, then the benefits will be paid."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2960.083,2963.558,"But only New York and Rhode Island, and possibly the Virgin Islands."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2963.558,2965.676,Have this particular approach.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2965.676,2970.041,"That is pay out in any economic strike, at least after a waiting period?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2970.041,2973.514,"Yes, but pay nothing no matter what the circumstances --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2973.514,2974.143,During the waiting period.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2974.143,2978.933,"During the suspension period, which eliminates most strikes from any payment altogether."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2984.353,2984.527,If it meets certain conditions?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2984.527,2991.287,"--the normal waiting period, after the normal waiting period, if these circumstances are what the statute includes."
1978.77-961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2991.287,2995.898,"Of course, your position here would be the same, whether there were waiting period or not, is it not?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,2995.898,3012.636,"Well, our position is that what Congress did in the Social Security Act was to give plenary and general permissions to the states to develop whatever kind of program they wished and what was setout in the Social Security Act where there's restrictions and not the permissions."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3012.636,3028.685,"I think your brief retreats from the rational conclusion of that position, i.e. if a state decided to pay double wages to strikers, you'd have a hard time."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3028.685,3037.029,"Well, I think Your Honor that the Congress certainly didn't prohibit any of the possible options, but it would be unfeasible and unpolitical to have anything like that happen."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3046.852,3055.439,"But you think there would be no pre-emption of that, if the state decided about economic strikers, we're going to pay double what they get by working?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3055.439,3057.11,"Well, I think that --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3057.11,3059.26,You think there would be no pre-emption problem with the law?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3059.26,3071.14,"There -- Congress did not prohibit whatever option the states adopt, however, I think that the wisdom of Congress in supposing that the states will act reasonably, because the example that Your Honor gives is very unreasonable and given that policy but --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3071.14,3074.577,"Well, I think it's given in your brief, it's given in your brief if I'm not mistaken, isn't it?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3074.577,3075.625,"No, not that particular example, --"
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3075.625,3076.577,Some amicus brief or something.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3076.577,3087.499,-- but I think that Congress -- the confidence that Congress had that obviously the states would not do something unreasonable has been justified by the fact that in 40 years in 50 different states --
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3087.499,3090.493,But sometimes that quite a violent assumption.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3090.493,3107.657,"-- nothing like that has ever occurred, no state has ever passed on such unreasonable law and we've had 50 jurisdictions to experiment in and more than 40 years for that to have happened, but in fact I think the states have justified Congress' confidence and not having gone to any such bad policy --"
1978.77-961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.657,3111.094,"Well, I think your opponent thinks that New York and Rhode Island have an unreasonable law."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3111.094,3111.483,Yes.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3111.483,3120.286,"Yes, but the example that Mr. Justice Stewart had cited is very far from anything that has occurred or I think would occur."
1978.77-961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3161.676,3162.545,But Mrs.Marcus.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3162.545,3162.779,Yes.
1978.77-961,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3162.779,3171.456,"I don't think your opponent really says that there's need to be a uniform policy, I think what they're saying is anything is all right so long as it doesn't interfere with the overriding policy of neutrality."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3171.456,3183.755,"Well, my understanding of what the petitioner is urging here is that the payment of unemployment benefits during strikes, which includes all the different options that all the different states have adopted can't be done."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3207.432,3208.63,In this precise area?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3208.63,3209.289,Though in this precise area.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3209.289,3217.247,Your opponent doesn't question at all the autonomy of the states to indulge in all the variety they want to in other areas of unemployment compensation.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3217.247,3228.265,"No, in the question of paying unemployment benefits to strikers, no matter what the option is, no matter what the version, no matter what the money, no matter what the circumstances, no pay under any circumstances."
1978.77-961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.463,3232.167,I'm not sure that's a fair statement of their position.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3254.763,3261.074,"Well, they have repeatedly used the phrase that a uniform national policy is essential, and I think it's quite clear that --"
1978.77-961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.074,3263.41,To the extent of neutrality act.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3263.41,3267.027,To the extent that you can't pay unemployment benefits during strikes.
1978.77-961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.799,3275.344,"But if they can see welfare benefits are all right, I don't know why they wouldn't concede unemployment benefits of no greater amount or something like that wouldn't also be fair."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3275.344,3278.578,"Well, I think that's an inconsistency in their position, but I think it's there that --"
1978.77-961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.578,3280.788,I see.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3283.626,3284.195,No.
1978.77-961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.195,3289.644,"All we have to do decide when there is admitted, you don't deny the finding of a national impact in the bargaining process."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3289.644,3291.261,Yes indeed we do Your Honor.
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3291.261,3293.028,Despite the two-court rule?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3293.028,3295.327,"Yes, I think what the Second Circuit was doing."
1978.77-961,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3310.771,3317.202,"Future findings by the District Court which were not upset by the Court of Appeals and your familiar course with the two-court rule, aren't you?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3317.202,3333.22,"Yes, I think by large, it doesn't matter whether there were -- in other words, we don't feel, we feel that the record overwhelmingly refutes the impact, because of the statistics that we evolved."
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.762,3365.935,"Is what you're saying that the Court of Appeals said basically assuming for the sake of argument that the District Court's findings are correct and therefore, we will not review them on a clearly erroneous basis."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3366.139,3375.355,"I think they weren't -- they were not interested in the facts and properly so, because the question of pre-emption is not one of the economic theory, it's one of congressional intention."
1978.77-961,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3375.355,3378.014,"Well, it can be one of economic fact though, can it?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3378.014,3390.673,"But here, the question is did Congress permit, did Congress intend that the states have the latitude that we say that the Social Security Act and these other statutes demonstrated."
1978.77-961,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3399.859,3407.662,Could the state of adopt the law that in any strike these unions shall pay for the loss of management?
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3407.662,3408.165,I beg your pardon.
1978.77-961,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3408.165,3418.788,"That in any strike, during the time of the strike, the union shall pay management its losses, period."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3418.788,3427.659,"Well, that hasn't to do with unemployment compensation, so I couldn't say what restrictions there might be on that."
1978.77-961,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3431.831,3448.53,"I suppose the New York states said that where there is a strike, the management shall contribute to the unemployment insurance, whatever amount there is left over what they lose in the strike."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3448.53,3454.608,That the employer should contribute to the --
1978.77-961,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3454.608,3457.449,Fund.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3457.449,3461.215,"Well, the method of financing, the unemployment --"
1978.77-961,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3461.215,3466.784,"I'm just trying to get something that has something to do with unemployment, and I assume financing is."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3466.784,3469.718,"Yes, the method of -- as far as the method of financing --"
1978.77-961,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3469.718,3475.557,"I don't think you need to take the position of the states, are left free to do whatever they please."
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3475.557,3475.97,Well --
1978.77-961,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3475.97,3480.072,"And that's what you keep saying, you don't need it for this case, do you?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3480.072,3481.653,"Perhaps we don't, but I believe --"
1978.77-961,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3481.653,3484.671,"Then, why keep pushing for it?"
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3484.671,3503.527,"It was I believe an answer to a question about what the Social Security Act did and I think it's clear that its structure was to give this broad permission, but what's I think equally significant here is that New Yorks law existed at the time that the Social Security Act, the National Labor Relations Act were passed."
1978.77-961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3504.276,3506.426,May I take Mr. Justice Marshall's question --
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3506.426,3506.51,Yes.
1978.77-961,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3506.51,3507.911,-- one step further.
1978.77-961,1,36297,maria_l_marcus,,3520.905,3528.091,"No, I really wouldn't, because I think the -- as I said the Social Security Act did give a plenary and general permission."
1978.77-961,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3596.635,3597.712,Thank you Mrs. Marcus.
