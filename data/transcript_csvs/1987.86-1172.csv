1987.86-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.539,"We'll hear argument next in No. 86-1172, Goodyear Atomic Corporation versus Esto Miller and the Industrial Commission of Ohio."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,73.512,79.5,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.86-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.654,199.612,"I take it there's no doubt here, Mr. Tait, that the regular incidence of Ohio Unemployment Compensation law apply to the Goodyear Atomic plant?"
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,199.612,213.872,"There is no question, Your Honor, that in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 290, the Workers Compensation benefits, normal Workers Compensation benefits do apply to the operations of this plant and to Goodyear employees, yes."
1987.86-1172,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,256.365,258.349,"Not a great deal involved, was there?"
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,258.349,265.82,"--No, there was not a great deal involved, and in fact there has never been a great deal involved with respect to this particular claim as a monetary matter."
1987.86-1172,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.478,335.115,"Well, does it make any difference that the Federal facility is being operated by a private contractor?"
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,335.115,338.501,"Your Honor, we submit that it makes no difference whatsoever."
1987.86-1172,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.026,384.132,Was there any discussion in Hancock of how to reconcile that with Penn Dairies?
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,384.132,398.123,"Well, Your Honor, the Penn Dairies line of cases which are raised by the appellant as a way to try to evade the Hancock immunity in this case, seems to me to involve three different areas of inquiry."
1987.86-1172,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.254,451.324,What if this were a third party tort action under State law not involving an employee.
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,458.013,466.417,"Well, it would seem to me that the question would become the extent of the effect of the action on the operation of the facility itself."
1987.86-1172,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.963,488.199,What's your answer?
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,488.199,495.119,"--I suppose my answer, Your Honor, is that it depends on the particular circumstance how far the Federal immunity applies."
1987.86-1172,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.939,508.777,"Well, the effective of a State tort action is generally in a sense regulatory."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,518.984,531.208,--If in fact the basis behind the State tort action is contractor operation that is basically in compliance with how the Federal Government has instructed him to operate.
1987.86-1172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.362,582.206,"Mr. Tait, to add on to Justice O'Connor's question, what if there was a Federal Statute that said State tort law shall apply, notwithstanding otherwise applicable Federal immunity."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,586.626,604.504,"Well, if I interpret the Hancock decision correctly, Your Honor, if in fact there is specific Congressional authorization of the type of State activity that is attempted to be imposed on the facility, then that expresses the Federal Government's Congressional intent to allow that type of application."
1987.86-1172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.504,608.122,"Well, here we don't have a statute that says State tort law shall apply."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,611.49,612.307,That's correct.
1987.86-1172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,612.307,620.846,"And at the time that statute was enacted, as I understand it, what, one-seventh of the States' Workmen's Compensation laws had a provision like this."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,620.846,621.846,That's correct.
1987.86-1172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.846,627.516,You say that they regulate the activity rather than they're just monetary.
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,648.213,651.032,"As a practical matter, Your Honor, I don't think that's possible."
1987.86-1172,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.112,677.182,And your response would be that the Supreme Court didn't say we have to obey these State rules.
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,680.551,688.074,"It seems to me that if we would so respond, Your Honor, that's small solace for the union, nor is it going to help our labor difficulties at all."
1987.86-1172,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.074,703.334,"if you rely on the labor situation, would it not be possible independently of a State requirement for the labor union to negotiate a contract which contained a provision that the employer would agree to abide by State regulations even though not compelled by State law to do so."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,705.701,717.074,"It seems to me that that's permissible, Your Honor, but again, we would argue that first of all that was certainly something that was not contemplated by the Congress when they passed the Atomic Energy Act, which requires exclusive control."
1987.86-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.074,726.113,"--Well, Mr. Tait, isn't there a Code of Safety, a Federal Code, that your client has to abide by?"
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,726.113,726.33,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.436,765.555,"Well, the question is what Congress intended."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,765.555,767.005,--Absolutely.
1987.86-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.005,785.483,"I suppose if there was some real conflict between a State regulation and this Federal code, I suppose the Federal code would be supreme."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,794.238,794.672,Scaffolding regulation.
1987.86-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.672,799.559,"--Scaffolding regulation, that is not inconsistent with any provision--"
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,799.559,803.428,The scaffolding regulation itself is not inconsistent with any Federal regulation.
1987.86-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,847.957,860.181,"--Well, I take it you say that absent this permission to apply the State Workmen's Compensation Act, it would be clear that the State could not regulate anything here."
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,860.181,861.248,That's correct.
1987.86-1172,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.248,869.652,And you say that this provision of with respect to the Workmen's Compensation Act wouldn't really change that.
1987.86-1172,0,40652,robert_e_tait,,869.652,870.354,"Section 290, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1172,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.46,881.026,"Thank you, Mr. Tait."
1987.86-1172,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,882.661,893.367,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.841,910.062,Did Hancock v. Train involve anything like Section 290 here?
1987.86-1172,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,910.062,929.273,"--Hancock v. Train involved what was I think a closer question, Mr. Chief Justice, which whether Section 118 of the Clean Air Act constituted specific authorization to the State of Kentucky to regulate a Federal facility, such as Paducah production plant."
1987.86-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,941.081,950.853,"But if we affirm the judgment here, it doesn't seem to me we're authorizing blanket regulation of these facilities by the State of Ohio."
1987.86-1172,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,964.66,966.528,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.83,1024.032,I might also suggest that circumstances alter cases.
1987.86-1172,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1027.067,1028.436,That's correct.
1987.86-1172,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.436,1038.725,I'd also suggest that one-seventh of the States didn't have that kind of a provision at the time this adoption of the workmen's compensation law was enacted by the Congress.
1987.86-1172,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1038.725,1040.827,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1172,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.551,1216.99,"Mr. Merrill, may I just ask in that connection, supposing there were a suit by one employee against another arising out of some charge of negligence in the plant."
1987.86-1172,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1219.656,1220.625,Yes.
1987.86-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.704,1248.775,"Well, suppose a member of the public slips and falls as he comes in and says it was just unsafely maintained."
1987.86-1172,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1256.012,1260.833,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, we think it's a more difficult question."
1987.86-1172,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.128,1568.814,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,1571.682,1581.038,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1172,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2053.518,2064.79,I take it that you're convinced that this is compensatory and not regulatory in view of the history you've recited?
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2064.79,2065.409,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1172,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.001,2099.896,"Well, Mr. Jaffy, would this be a different case at all if the safety standard at issue for the additional award were one that were contrary to the particular applicable safety standard adopted by DOE?"
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2099.896,2103.264,I don't think it would be a different issue.
1987.86-1172,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.268,2112.12,I understand that.
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2112.12,2112.97,There's no difference.
1987.86-1172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.64,2175.61,"There has to be a violation, too, Mr. Jaffy, and that's what I'm a little bit hung up on."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2223.507,2231.245,"--So that you and I are both perfectly clear, I don't think you have to make a finding on whether there is a violation or not."
1987.86-1172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.688,2256.645,"Well, and don't we also have to find that this employer can be in violation of Ohio's regulatory laws, or can we let Ohio say he's in violation, when he isn't?"
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2256.645,2270.238,"Justice Scalia, if I may, I think what you need to find is that Congress provided by 40 U.S.C. 290 that State workers' compensation laws are applicable."
1987.86-1172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.511,2287.264,"I'm willing to say they are applicable, but they only apply if he is in violation of the State law."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2303.459,2326.908,"I don't think it raises a separate question, because all that Ohio does, if it determines that the injury is due to the safety requirement not having been followed, all that happens is that compensation is paid to Mr. Miller."
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.508,2522.78,"Mr. Jaffy, you referred us to the letter of Goodyear about this incident as the Joint Appendix at 43."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2522.78,2523.28,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.28,2532.235,That letter refers to the fact that the scaffold had been inspected by the Safety Department and found to be in satisfactory condition.
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2536.889,2542.277,It refers to the Company Safety Department.
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2542.277,2542.51,I see.
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2545.462,2545.762,No.
1987.86-1172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.161,2603.232,No on site inspection of the plant by the Workmen's Compensation people?
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2603.232,2605.0,"--No, no on site inspection."
1987.86-1172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.559,2736.485,"Mr. Jaffy, I think what the Government's position would be is that in the same manner and in the same extent simply means this, that where a person is not in violation of a State regulation, he should not be assessed the surcharge."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2761.534,2762.486,"No, sir."
1987.86-1172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.158,2776.36,But it's only payable if the person's in violation of a regulation.
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,2778.895,2784.466,It is a way of explaining or trying to explain that there is this requirement.
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.893,3017.713,"Mr. Jaffy, can I just clear up a couple of things in my own mind."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3025.45,3030.104,"Yes, I think that I would agree to that."
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.104,3032.456,"So to that extent, the regulations are preempted."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3037.658,3038.027,Yes.
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.7,3132.7,Let me ask you one other question.
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3144.291,3148.828,"There is nothing paid to the claimant, number one."
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3162.136,3171.158,"Well, not OSHA, but there's special regulations, not OSHA regulations, but regulations related to this particular plant as I understood it, or at least to nuclear facilities."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3171.158,3178.597,They have authority in connection with the radiological aspects to provide regulations.
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.597,3185.418,But don't they also provide safety regulations for the non-radiological aspects of the operation?
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3185.418,3190.572,"The legislation permits them, the legislation permits them to adopt."
1987.86-1172,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.957,3197.892,"Oh, I see, the OSHA regulations do apply."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3197.892,3202.546,"Yes, as to non-radiological aspects, okay."
1987.86-1172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3228.011,3252.978,"We'd have no problem here of course, and I assume the Government would concede the case... I assume the Government would... if the Ohio provision read that this surcharge is applicable if someone violates a specific safety rule of the Industrial Commission or of any other Governmental entity which may have jurisdiction."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3265.12,3272.124,"Well, we may be making this more complicated, Justice Scalia, than we need to."
1987.86-1172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.124,3272.724,"Well, we tend to do that."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3272.724,3282.748,"And very frankly, I have to apologize, I'm not certain that I at all understand the distinction that you're trying to make."
1987.86-1172,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3292.187,3308.732,"Well, what I'm saying is I think it would be unfortunate if this thing sort of falls between the cracks, that is to say, if it didn't violate the Ohio provision, but did violate OSHA, surely there ought to be a surcharge applicable."
1987.86-1172,2,41561,stewart_w_jaffy,,3319.569,3329.711,"I think if the State of Ohio were to adopt the OSHA regulations as part of their safety requirements, what you're saying is 100 percent correct."
1987.86-1172,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3399.838,3402.556,"Thank you, Mr. Jaffy, your time has expired."
1987.86-1172,3,40652,robert_e_tait,,3405.158,3408.027,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1172,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3459.125,3461.408,"Well, Mr. Tait, what about Justice Scalia's question."
1987.86-1172,3,40652,robert_e_tait,,3479.706,3484.408,"--Mr. Justice, I believe that pursuant to Hancock, that decision is placed in the hands of Congress."
1987.86-1172,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3486.991,3487.158,"No, no."
1987.86-1172,3,40652,robert_e_tait,,3490.412,0.0,--Yes.
