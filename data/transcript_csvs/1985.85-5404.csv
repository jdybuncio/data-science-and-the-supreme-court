1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.987,We will hear arguments first this morning in Allen against Illinois.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,9.772,22.246,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as I speak to the Court this morning, the petitioner, Terry Allen, is incarcerated in a maximum security penal institution in the State of Illinois."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,53.468,57.853,Is that a criminal procedure or a civil procedure?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,60.305,62.756,"It is under the Criminal Code, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,71.262,76.916,But you concede the legislature has described this as a civil proceeding.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,76.916,79.233,It has in the statute itself.
1985.85-5404,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,86.47,87.02,Excuse me.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,90.838,94.492,--That is the proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
1985.85-5404,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,99.194,101.062,Is that possible in a civil case?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,101.062,117.405,"That was the thrust of the decision in Statulak versus Coughlin, a Seventh Circuit case in 1975: which ruled that the proceeding, though denominated civil, was sufficiently criminal as to require the imposition of a burden beyond a reasonable doubt."
1985.85-5404,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,120.207,127.296,Will you elaborate a little bit on the type of institution in which these persons are confined?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,131.981,133.783,"It is a state prison, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,133.783,140.437,Is it indistinguishable from other prisons that do not have psychiatric cases?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,140.437,144.056,"It is indistinguishable in our judgment, Your Honor, from other institutions."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,165.421,166.688,It is a hospital.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,166.688,169.54,It is a mental health treatment center.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,176.61,180.431,This person confined in there is just not an outpatient.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,182.981,183.666,He stays there.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.566,198.309,Are the persons in the psychiatric wing or whatever the building is segregated completely from persons in the criminal part of the structure?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,198.309,199.975,"No, they are not, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,201.427,202.577,Do they dine together?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,202.577,203.713,"--Yes, they do."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.846,211.133,"Do the psychiatric people, are they required to occupy cells at night?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,211.133,212.033,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,212.033,213.069,They are?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,213.069,213.952,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.47,283.229,"Mr. Meinz, do I understand from your response that Justice Marshall's question about the burden of proof that the source of the beyond a reasonable doubt burden was not the Illinois legislature but a Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit decision?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,283.229,284.129,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,324.389,329.091,"Mr. Meinz, Mr. Allen was indicted, wasn't he?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,329.091,330.626,Mr. Allen was indicted.
1985.85-5404,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,330.626,332.093,Is that indictment still outstanding?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,332.093,341.268,"Yes, it is, and it will be until such time as Mr. Allen can prove that he has recovered from the sexually dangerous person condition."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.264,369.435,"As long as he is not cured, he won't be tried, and when he is cured, it will be dismissed."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,369.435,370.335,--That is true.
1985.85-5404,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,383.845,385.511,And he may never be able to prove it.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,385.511,387.844,He may never be able to prove that he has recovered.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.844,389.213,So he will be there until his death.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,389.213,389.479,That is true.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,389.479,390.863,Like in a civil commitment.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,390.863,395.7,"That is possible, except we argue there are very real distinctions."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.7,398.152,"Well, I know, but in that respect it is the same."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,398.152,407.924,"Yes, Your Honor, but there would be periodic review available in such a civil mental health commitment that is not available in a sexually dangerous person commitment."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.815,422.1,You mean in a civil commitment.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,422.1,422.784,In a civil commitment.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.784,425.636,And here who has the burden?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,425.636,428.088,"The defendant... excuse me, the accused."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,429.956,432.256,How often can he raise the question?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,432.256,438.812,He can raise the question as often as he wants and as soon as he wants upon being committed to the Menard Psychiatric Center.
1985.85-5404,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,458.273,461.242,Is the hearing held in the institution or in the court?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,461.242,474.419,"In the committing court, Your Honor, the court in which he was originally found to be a sexually dangerous person, and that court must make the decision whether or not the respondent, the accused, remains a sexually dangerous person."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.078,573.064,Does Illinois provide for a civil commitment that might be brought by family or next friend?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,573.064,578.052,"Yes, it does, as does every other treatment program that I am aware of, Your Honor, in the state of Illinois."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,590.96,601.399,"So if the family became aware of the potentialities, they, the family might proceed independently of the civil action and ask that the person be committed."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,602.016,603.534,In the civil area.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,642.326,646.111,"Well, the issue here is the Fifth Amendment, I take it."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,646.111,647.297,"Yes, it is."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.28,659.954,And since whether or not a psychiatrist's opinion based on statements that he is making from the respondent is admissible?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,659.954,660.654,Yes.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.654,663.806,The statements themselves were not offered in this case.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,663.806,668.543,Only part of the statements were actually admitted into evidence at the formal hearing.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.543,674.03,The objection really is the opinions of the psychiatrist based on his statements.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,674.03,674.747,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.747,679.601,And you say that those opinions are inadmissible unless what?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,679.601,688.957,"Unless he is informed that he has a right to silence, and if he is informed of the consequences of his speaking."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.957,694.009,Would you say he had to have a lawyer present at the time of the--
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,694.009,694.627,"No, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.577,697.229,--You say it is a criminal proceeding.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,699.179,700.514,--Our claim is a narrow one.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.716,707.118,And not for jury trial later?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,707.118,708.418,Not for jury trial.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.839,723.028,"Why are you claiming... what makes the Fifth Amendment so... why do you think you are entitled to the Fifth Amendment privilege, but not the jury trial?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,723.028,734.736,"Because this is a criminal case within the scope of the Fifth Amendment, which is construed more broadly than the criminal case provisions of the Sixth Amendment, in our judgment."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.287,760.784,"I know, but surely the Fifth Amendment can be claimed in a civil proceeding, but it can't if it isn't incriminating, and these statements certainly can't be used in any criminal case, a wholly criminal case."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,760.784,762.403,"We believe they can, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.688,767.688,How could they ever be used in a criminal proceeding?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,767.688,768.89,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.89,771.759,How could they ever be used in a criminal proceeding?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,771.759,786.518,"After the sexually dangerous person or the person alleged to be a sexually dangerous person had spoken to a psychiatrist, and was compelled to speak for that psychiatrist, it is our judgment that the statements could thereafter be used in a criminal prosecution."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.518,789.136,Which criminal prosecution?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,789.136,799.159,"If the state fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is a sexually dangerous person, we believe that the state can return to the underlying criminal charge."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,800.444,803.313,It would be inadmissible then as having been compelled.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,803.313,807.615,"--But the state of Illinois, the Illinois Supreme Court does not give us that."
1985.85-5404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,807.615,810.3,The Supreme Court of Illinois said you had immunity though.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,810.3,811.65,"A use immunity, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.65,812.252,Use immunity.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,812.986,814.536,"No, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,837.284,852.059,"What you say is that your client ought to have the same sort of privilege as a defendant has in a criminal case, and he can't even be called to the stand against his will, and no amount of immunity would do him any good unless it is full transactional immunity."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,852.059,863.867,"We are insisting that he not be called to the stand, which under our judgment is also possible, given the ruling of the Illinois Supreme Court that he has no privilege against self-incrimination."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.053,877.861,You are saying that all a defendant has to do is refuse to speak to the psychiatrist and that is the end of it.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,877.861,878.577,Yes.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.577,890.251,So for all practical purposes the state may not compel him to go through the sexually criminal proceeding.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,890.251,894.286,"No, Your Honor, they cannot compel him to speak to those examples."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.405,896.922,How else are they going to determine it?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,896.922,899.374,"--They have a great many other ways to make their case, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.374,899.857,Like what?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,899.857,903.559,They have to prove once again a mental condition and past misconduct.
1985.85-5404,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,926.858,928.793,But how would you prove the mental condition?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,928.793,945.088,"--The mental condition could be derived from psychiatric observations of the defendant, of the respondent, rather, at a proceeding, or from past records, prior records of one sort or another."
1985.85-5404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,945.088,947.238,"But that isn't a very satisfactory way, is it?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,953.861,963.3,"Your Honor, my experience shows that indeed the state can and has proved a sexually dangerous person without regard, without--"
1985.85-5404,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,963.3,970.953,When a person being committed has refused to speak at all to the examining physician?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,973.405,997.688,"--Where the... I should point out where they emphasize where the state's evidence emphasizes past criminal conduct of the respondent, and where the state's case emphases the alleged underlying offense, and where the psychiatric testimony was merely a by-product was merely only another portion of the evidence that was introduced."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.713,1016.184,"Under the Illinois law, must he speak to the psychiatrist?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1016.184,1017.917,He certainly must.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.917,1020.136,Does the law say so?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1020.136,1023.021,"Yes, it does, the law and the case law."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.707,1028.992,"And if he refuses to speak, is he subject to contempt?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1028.992,1029.575,"--Yes, he is."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.575,1032.611,That is clear from the law.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1032.611,1033.813,That is clear from the law.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.05,1048.822,I would think compelled testimony like that would be very difficult to get into a later purely criminal proceeding.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1048.822,1058.511,"--Except, Your Honor, we read the Illinois Supreme Court's decision for what it is, and what it is is a statement that the person enjoys only a use immunity, and no more."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.511,1061.194,And what is wrong with that?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1061.194,1069.117,I don't believe it is coextensive with the privilege which they are requesting him to waive under Kastigar versus the United States.
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.735,1075.621,We haven't insisted on that.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1075.621,1078.656,--Not transactional immunity.
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1081.841,1090.447,"We don't have that issue before us in this case, however, its possible use in a truly criminal trial at some future date."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1091.648,1093.048,That is not before the Court.
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1093.048,1112.396,"Hasn't Illinois, having two prongs to deal with this, given people in this unfortunate situation an opportunity to avoid a criminal conviction and a criminal record by providing a civil means of dealing with it?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1112.396,1113.846,"We wish they had, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1113.846,1114.598,"Well, haven't they?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1114.598,1115.298,"No, they haven't."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1117.398,1120.752,"Well, in your judgment, but they have two statutes, two provisions."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1122.735,1125.554,"--Three provisions, Your Honor, We would submit."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.554,1128.506,"Well, the underlying civil commitment."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1130.774,1134.059,It is announced by the legislature to be civil.
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1152.271,1158.19,Are you suggesting that that makes it a criminal case and not a civil case because of the means?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1158.19,1164.844,"No, not the mere placement of this particular piece of legislation in the Criminal Code as opposed to the Mental Health Code or elsewhere."
1985.85-5404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.306,1191.662,How strong is your argument to include proof beyond a reasonable doubt when that was really imposed by the Seventh Circuit?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1203.469,1206.587,"--The legislature has since... well, has incorporated it, yes."
1985.85-5404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.587,1211.389,"Yes, but it is doubtful it would have done that without the Seventh Circuit constitutional--"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1211.389,1220.395,And the Illinois Supreme Court had done so as well without regard to Stachulak versus Coughlin on the grounds that they recognized that there were very serious consequences.
1985.85-5404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.922,1260.389,"--However well reasoned it may have been, I thought you were arguing that here Illinois has incorporated a number of elements into this type of case, and therefore Illinois must have intended it to be a criminal case, because it has put so many criminal protections into it, and all I am saying is that it seems to me that the argument about reasonable doubt is somewhat different because that really didn't start with the Illinois legislature."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1260.389,1261.056,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.595,1276.316,The Illinois Supreme Court in this case has dealt with it as a civil proceeding.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1276.316,1278.749,"They have indeed, and that is our complaint."
1985.85-5404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.749,1279.767,"Well, I know."
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1295.61,1304.649,And we disagree strenuously with that decision on the grounds of the sexual psychopath legislation cases and on the grounds particularly of In Re Gault.
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1304.649,1312.172,"In our case, Addington against Texas, that was seven or eight years ago, was that a civil case or a criminal case?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1312.172,1313.239,That was a civil case.
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.505,1325.111,"Now, didn't we hold there that there could be an enhanced, a greater than preponderance of the evidence without altering the character of the proceeding as a civil proceeding?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1325.111,1325.627,--Yes.
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1325.627,1338.87,"Why do you... you have spent a great deal of time now arguing that because of the nature of the burden of proof there, that that makes it a criminal case, but Addington is directly contrary, is it not?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1338.87,1343.072,"Then perhaps I have misspoken, and especially in light of Justice Rehnquist's question."
1985.85-5404,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1404.813,1407.348,May I ask you another question?
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1421.54,1424.642,"I think, Your Honor, that--"
1985.85-5404,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1424.642,1433.248,"Are you still contemplating a third type of proceeding where the party involved is a sexually dangerous person, or is so alleged?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1433.248,1439.086,"--No, we believe that there is room for the sexually dangerous person proceeding in Illinois."
1985.85-5404,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1439.086,1440.252,So there could be three proceedings.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1440.252,1442.271,"There would be, in our view, three proceedings."
1985.85-5404,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1446.14,1451.377,"So one is criminal, one is purely civil, and the other is sort of a hybrid one in between?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1451.377,1480.746,"Yes, but we would argue that the sexually dangerous person proceeding, while it lies between the middle of the traditional criminal prosecution and the civil mental health commitment, is skewed to one side, and is skewed very drastically toward the criminal side, and that is why we argue that the proceeding must be considered so far criminal in nature as to warrant the privilege, the application of the privilege against self-incrimination, and we urge this Court to find such privilege."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1490.085,1497.239,"If you prevail here, is it reasonable to assume that the state will proceed against him on a criminal charge?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1497.239,1502.309,"They cannot proceed against Allen on a criminal charge, though they might, they might."
1985.85-5404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.569,1520.871,Refresh my recollection about the Sachulak case.
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1524.675,1527.044,"Not in so many words, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.994,1538.934,"Didn't it hold that the consequences or the stigma in the punitive consequences were severe enough to justify the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard, which also applied in the criminal case?"
1985.85-5404,0,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,1538.934,1539.651,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-5404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1542.053,1548.04,Mr. Rotert.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1548.04,1564.233,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are several points on which respondents differ significantly from the petitioner on both the facts and the law that are relevant to this particular inquiry this morning."
1985.85-5404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.15,1624.355,"But of course his claim is that because this was so much like a criminal proceeding, it shouldn't have been used against him in this proceeding, that he shouldn't have been callable for any purpose, I guess."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1624.355,1633.563,"That is certainly true, Justice Rehnquist, and I think that leads us to the second major fundamental distinction between the parties, and that is the position of the state of Illinois that this is a civil statute."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1673.688,1690.483,"Mr. Rotert, one point I am worried about is, at the hearing, if the judge put the respondent on the stand and asked him a question, and the guy said, I refuse to testify, what could you do about it?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1691.266,1702.54,"Your Honor, I believe that if the respondent to a sexually dangerous persons proceeding is put in that circumstance he faces the same options that a grand jury witness would have faced had he been given--"
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1702.54,1705.259,I am not talking about grand jury.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1708.777,1709.411,--In this case.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1709.411,1717.467,"The judge put him on the stand, and asked him a question, and the respondent says, on the basis of the Fifth Amendment, I refuse to answer."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1720.185,1744.117,"It would be recognized if he were claiming the privilege for any criminal prosecution that might result, because he can claim it at any time, but it would not be recognized if he said, I refuse to answer because I think I might be found sexually dangerous as a result of my answer, because being found sexually dangerous is not a criminal prosecution, conviction, or punishment, so it is not something that the Fifth Amendment would provide protection for."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1744.117,1749.188,So this is a civil procedure which ends up with a jail sentence.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1749.188,1756.592,"It is a civil provision which ends up with nothing of the sort, Justice Marshall, and that is another very serious factual distinction between the parties."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1762.329,1763.262,"Well, it is a jail, isn't it?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1763.262,1766.566,It is a facility for psychiatric care--
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.566,1767.416,"It is a jail, isn't it--"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1767.416,1768.116,"--No, Your Honor, it is--"
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1768.116,1768.85,--It is not a jail?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1768.85,1769.602,--It is not a jail.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1769.602,1771.068,But it has bars?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1771.068,1771.702,It has bars.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1771.702,1772.785,And you can't get out?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1772.785,1774.068,You are not free to leave.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.068,1774.904,And it is not a jail?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1776.287,1777.772,Justice Marshall--
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.772,1779.172,It is an institution.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1779.172,1780.258,--It is an institution.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.258,1781.108,Like Sing Sing.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1781.108,1783.041,"No, Your Honor, not like Sing Sing."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.374,1784.893,"Well, isn't Sing Sing an institution?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1784.893,1788.928,"There are many institutions, not all of which are like Sing Sing, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1802.605,1811.793,"Don't you eat and live with the... I mean, and exercise with the other criminal prisoners?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1811.793,1815.845,You have the right to all the facilities available to anyone at the Menard Institution.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1815.845,1819.614,"Well, it is a criminal institution."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1819.614,1828.153,"I understand, Justice Marshall, that that is your belief, but I don't believe that that is what you would conclude if you had an opportunity to examine all of the data."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.99,1837.175,You assume I didn't read that?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1838.125,1839.442,Mr. Justice Marshall--
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.442,1840.627,I read it in other places.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1845.013,1845.947,--That's correct.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1845.947,1848.097,But they are all in one institution.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1848.097,1848.982,That is not correct.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.982,1851.116,"Well, don't they all eat together?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1851.116,1855.886,The dining arrangements may well be such that they eat in the same facility--
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1855.886,1858.088,You say it may be or is true?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1858.088,1860.254,"--It is true, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.254,1860.821,It is true.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1861.123,1871.812,But the Illinois Supreme Court has insisted years ago that the person committed under the Sexually Dangerous Persons Act is not to be kept at Menard Prison.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.642,1893.992,Does the record show how many people are there?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1893.992,1897.777,Menard Psychiatric Institute has about 30 sexually dangerous persons.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1897.777,1898.16,How many?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1898.16,1901.479,About 30 sexually dangerous persons respondents are there.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1901.479,1902.579,And how many psychiatrists?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1902.579,1905.031,I am not aware of the number of psychiatrists on staff.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1907.633,1909.752,Is he a physical--
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1909.752,1913.12,He is an MD with a specialty in psychiatry.
1985.85-5404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1915.321,1917.004,--May I ask one other question about the institution?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1917.004,1917.587,--Please.
1985.85-5404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.587,1925.26,"Menard, as I understand it, part of Menard is a correctional institution in the punitive sense as well as the part that is for psychiatric care."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1925.26,1925.593,Most certainly.
1985.85-5404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.593,1928.895,"Now, if you take the whole unit, how many inmates altogether are there?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1928.895,1933.199,There are about 300 in the Menard Psychiatric Center at any given moment.
1985.85-5404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.199,1935.132,I am asking about the whole unit.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1935.132,1935.415,The whole unit.
1985.85-5404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.703,1941.469,That is what I was asking.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1941.469,1946.94,But Menard Prison is one of the three major maximum security facilities in the state Department of Corrections.
1985.85-5404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.051,1978.709,"And then the 300 inmates, persons, patients, whatever we call them, within that group include 30 or 35 sexually dangerous persons and another 250 or 270 other convicted felons who need psychiatric treatment."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1978.709,1979.311,This is correct.
1985.85-5404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.311,1983.613,And the 35 and the 270 basically are all in the same--
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1983.613,1984.196,They intermingle.
1985.85-5404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.196,1984.798,--Right.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,1984.798,1993.135,"They intermingle, Justice Stevens, and I think that it is important to remember that the Menard Psychiatric Institute is not warehousing these people."
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.147,2051.24,"As part of this special proceeding, must not there be proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the sex act that he had been charged with?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2051.44,2053.357,"Yes, there is such a requirement, Justice--"
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.357,2064.397,--So he has been convicted of a felony in the sense that... not by a jury but by the judge.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2064.397,2069.118,"--No, I don't believe he has been convicted of a felony even in an equivalent sense."
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.118,2074.855,"Well, beyond a reasonable doubt has it been proved that he committed the act?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2074.855,2076.022,"Yes, it has, Justice White."
1985.85-5404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2076.022,2087.163,"Would this proof on this record be sufficient to sustain if it were admissible, if all the proof were admissible, to sustain a conviction under the criminal statute?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2087.163,2089.929,"I believe it would have been, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.778,2114.228,"Well, of course not."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2114.228,2120.282,"The sexually dangerous person proceeding requires more information, and as the Illinois... I am sorry."
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.282,2128.787,But he nevertheless has produced evidence to show that a crime has been committed?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2128.787,2130.823,There has to be a showing that the propensity--
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.823,2131.756,Beyond a reasonable doubt.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2131.756,2132.339,--Correct.
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.339,2135.977,And then it requires a lot of other things.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2135.977,2149.885,"Correct, and I think that there has been a great deal of effort put into the idea that that element of the sexually dangerous persons finding makes it look very criminal, and I think that that is a very, very illusory argument when you consider that obviously--"
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.885,2156.991,It makes him much more like the other felons that he is in the hospital with.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2156.991,2167.846,--In the sense I would concede that you put people in the Menard Psychiatric Center only after they have demonstrated that they are going to create problems because of forcible sexual conduct that they indulged in.
1985.85-5404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.846,2175.602,"Well, he is there with a lot of other people who have psychiatric problems who aren't sexually dangerous."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2175.602,2176.752,That is true.
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2229.153,2254.054,"Mr. Rotert, the provisions for commitment under this proceeding result in an indefinite commitment, as I understand it, without any provision for periodic review at the instance of the state, unlike your ordinary involuntary civil commitment proceeding."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2255.404,2259.506,"No, it is not, Justice O'Connor, and I think that is another factual matter that needs--"
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2259.506,2262.124,"Well, would you explain why that is not--"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2262.124,2280.705,--The Illinois regulations under which the Department... the Illinois regulations that the Department of Corrections had imposed on the Menard Psychiatric Institute quite specifically and unambiguously require that the director of the Institute every six months will evaluate every person there because of the sexually dangerous persons finding.
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2309.539,2316.461,--How does it differ from what would happen with an ordinary involuntary commitment to a mental institution--
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2316.461,2317.045,--It differs--
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2317.045,2318.345,--for purposes of review?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2318.345,2323.032,--It differs in factors that inure to the benefit of the respondent.
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2333.453,2337.391,I am talking about the review mechanism only.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2346.813,2352.531,"Justice O'Connor, it differs in the sense that it is done... it doesn't differ in the sense that there is automatic review."
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2371.678,2382.736,In the civil proceeding is it brought to the court and the state must prove by a preponderance that the commitment should continue?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2382.736,2383.419,--That is correct.
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2383.419,2386.604,That doesn't occur with these proceedings?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2386.604,2392.858,"In these proceedings the respondent files his petition, and he bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence."
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2392.858,2397.246,Do you think that difference is significant for our purposes under In Re Gault?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2397.246,2413.671,"No, I do not, Justice O'Connor, for the reason that the burden that the respondent shares in filing such a recovery application has to be evaluated in the grasp of the statute which requires that he be given all the procedural protections that we have discussed already."
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2438.656,2449.028,"Well, your involuntary commitment in Illinois, is it not necessary to prove that the person is dangerous to himself or others to be involuntarily committed?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2449.028,2468.592,"The language differs significantly in that at some future time there may be some potential for problem, whereas the sexually dangerous person statute requires that there has been a demonstration within a specific time period in the recent past, and I do have a significant problem with the use of the word ""indefinite"" commitment."
1985.85-5404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.166,2621.073,"Well, but there's coersion in the sense that you say he may be required to testify against his will, and the Supreme Court of Illinois has said so, too, hasn't it?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2621.073,2626.46,"There is compulsion, but as Minnesota v. Murphy teaches us, Justice Rehnquist, compulsion isn't coersion."
1985.85-5404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.46,2627.077,I see what you mean.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2628.079,2628.846,There is compulsion.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2697.156,2703.56,"Did he claim the... where did he have a right to claim the privilege here, before the psychiatrist?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2703.56,2707.262,"He had the right at all times, in any proceeding, to claim a privilege if he thought--"
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.262,2714.951,"Well, didn't the law say out there that you are compelled under penalty of being held in contempt?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2718.92,2722.605,"--It's not the statutory law, but it certainly would be the application of a trial court."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2722.605,2723.405,"Well, is it the law?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2723.405,2724.057,It is the law.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.057,2727.176,"That if you don't testify, you are going to be held in contempt."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2727.176,2728.376,"That's correct, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.376,2729.878,And you consider that compulsion?
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2729.878,2732.913,"No, I do not, where he is immunized from criminal prosecution."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2748.689,2761.23,"Well, if I for one decided that this has enough of the indicia of a criminal prosecution to require the same rules, then you're in trouble."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2761.23,2764.765,--If you determine that this is--
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.765,2765.165,Yes.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2765.165,2765.448,"--a criminal prosecution, I can see that he's--"
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.448,2770.086,"No, I didn't say ""is"", has the indicia of a criminal prosecution."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2770.086,2770.402,--All right.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2771.286,2772.202,Which is you go to jail.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2772.202,2778.34,"--If the Court feels that this is the functional equivalent of a criminal prosecution, then certainly the Fifth Amendment applies."
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2778.34,2778.74,Right.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2778.74,2784.076,But what does the traditional criminal prosecution want to accomplish?
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2787.361,2789.797,Not to be convicted out of his own mouth.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2789.797,2790.832,--That's the Fifth Amendment.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2823.97,2826.338,"When you say prison, you mean the same prison that he's in?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2826.338,2830.29,"Justice Marshall, I'm talking about the imprisonment--"
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2830.29,2830.706,The same prison.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2830.706,2831.106,--on a conviction for felony.
1985.85-5404,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.106,2831.656,The same prison.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2831.656,2838.027,"It's... I understand that that's the Court's opinion, but it's not the same facility, and it's not a prison."
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2935.373,2950.217,"Mr. Rotert, does In Re Gault provide the tests that we should employ in determining whether it should be treated as a criminal proceeding for purposes of the Fifth Amendment?"
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,2950.217,2984.123,"I don't believe that Gault is a particularly helpful case in this context, Justice O'Connor, for the reason that I think that Gault involved a juvenile statute, and the language of the Court involved quite clearly indicates that it considered the actual effect of the statute involved on the juvenile to be indistinguishable from a criminal effect that a person would suffer, and in Gault, for example, it was noted that an adult convicted of the same offense would have received a petty fine whereas the juvenile was subjected to incarceration until he reached the age of majority under certain circumstances."
1985.85-5404,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3022.181,3030.604,"Well, but you do have to find the underlying criminal offense was committed."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,3030.604,3034.223,--We have to find that at one point within the past year.

1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,3128.618,3132.653,"I think that that's highly problematic and highly unrealistic, Justice Blackmun."
1985.85-5404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3132.653,3133.137,"Oh, really."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,3133.137,3141.742,"Yes, I do, because first of all, Terry Allen would have a constitutional right to get psychiatric examination, but where would the state be able to rebut his expert testimony?"
1985.85-5404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3148.948,3151.883,"Oh, they often prevail over psychiatric testimony."

1985.85-5404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3206.785,3209.053,I wouldn't describe it all as circumstantial evidence.
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,3209.053,3214.973,"Well, there is direct evidence of the psychiatrist that he has examined the individual and drawn certain conclusions."
1985.85-5404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3235.537,3239.339,"Well, I can't join your suffering for the State of Illinois."
1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,3239.339,3246.095,"Well, I think that the persons who suffer here are the respondents to sexually dangerous persons proceedings."

1985.85-5404,1,36592,mark_l_rotert,,3314.156,3316.941,"Absolutely, at the very first opportunity, Justice Stevens."

1985.85-5404,2,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,3382.883,3396.358,"--They are accorded a privilege that the examining psychiatrist must inform the subject of the privilege to remain silent, to refuse to speak to that examining psychiatrist, which is what we are arguing for here."
1985.85-5404,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3396.358,3399.326,May I ask this question?
1985.85-5404,2,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,3403.13,3406.166,"Absolutely, Your Honor, without question."
1985.85-5404,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3406.166,3406.932,Absolutely not?
1985.85-5404,2,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,3406.932,3408.368,Absolutely I would.
1985.85-5404,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3408.368,3409.084,"Oh, you would?"
1985.85-5404,2,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,3409.084,3410.568,I don't... yes.
1985.85-5404,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3429.197,3430.981,Is that because you think he would not have been convicted?
1985.85-5404,2,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,3430.981,3432.649,--Because he would not have been convicted.
1985.85-5404,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3444.041,3449.176,Is this because of the facts with respect to Allen with which you are familiar or would this be a generalization?
1985.85-5404,2,43638,verlin_r_meinz,,3449.176,3450.211,This would be a generalization.
