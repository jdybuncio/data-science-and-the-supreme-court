1985.35_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.779,We will hear arguments first this morning in the United States against the State of Maine.
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,11.465,16.854,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.35_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,145.537,147.254,What is a state ocean sanctuary?
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,151.332,170.684,"--Under Chapter 132-A, Sections 14 and 15 of the Massachusetts General Laws, Your Honor, the state has designated certain particularly important or ecologically or scenically unique areas of its coast as so-called ocean sanctuaries, and those cannot be changed or altered in any way by exploitation, advertising."
1985.35_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.083,200.219,"Mr. Herrmann, as I understand it, Massachusetts is claiming ancient title as the theory of its recovery?"
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,200.219,201.375,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1985.35_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.375,211.027,And I don't know that this Court has ever recognized ancient title as a theory of recovery as such.
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,240.811,242.982,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.35_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.984,403.448,"Mr. Herrmann, do you think that title acquired in that fashion can be abandoned by the states?"
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,403.448,435.311,"Theoretically, yes, Your Honor, but our position is, we have briefed that, and I would like to point out again, while in theory it could be abandoned, in practice prevailing international law imposes extremely strict provisions, how that must occur, and if those provisions are not met the theory of lapse or abandonment of an already perfected title, and may I just address that distinction, what the Master was talking about and what I think Your Honor is talking about is, once a title is perfected can it be abandoned or can it lapse."
1985.35_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.329,475.03,"Well, there's no problem here, because if the state doesn't have it the United States does."
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,494.835,501.425,"Your Honor, I don't think... I submit that they do not reflect abandonment by Massachusetts for the following reasons."
1985.35_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.503,889.893,"May I interrupt you, General Herrmann."
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,900.421,901.953,"No, Your Honor, I haven't."
1985.35_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.197,1113.805,Let me clarify one thing.
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,1120.381,1131.376,"Under prevailing international law, and by that I wish to point out to the Court, we do have a problem of so-called intertemporal law in this international law related case."
1985.35_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1306.757,1310.928,This was a requirement for ancient title as well as for other kinds of title?
1985.35_orig,0,27178,henry_herrmann,,1310.928,1315.333,"It is under these circumstances, Your Honor, as the Master, I think, correctly found."
1985.35_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1549.44,1555.61,Mr. Claiborne.
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1555.61,1558.686,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.35_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1894.661,1916.73,"Well, Mr. Claiborne, it seems to me that what Massachusetts is claiming is something under a so-called doctrine of ancient title on the theory that under that doctrine it in fact acquired title in colonial times regardless of what its claims were since."
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1927.054,1930.209,"Justice O'Connor, I have to say yes and no."
1985.35_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1930.209,1932.974,That's not very helpful.
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1932.974,1934.519,"Well, I will attempt to explain."
1985.35_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.48,2068.81,"All right, but if Massachusetts is correct that it acquired ancient title at one time, and if you are correct that it was abandoned later by Massachusetts at a time when the United States was not claiming it, does that mean that the title then passed to international usage and the boundaries of the United States were altered, at the time of any abandonment?"
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2068.81,2124.881,"Justice O'Connor, if one assumes, contrary to our argument that there ever was a perfected claim or perfected ancient title, and that that title survived until... or through the period when the United States became a sovereign nation, then what Your Honor suggests could indeed be the result, but it was open to the United States to reclaim that area as it did with respect to the resources of the seabed in the Truman Proclamation of 1945, and as it has with respect to fisheries in other legislation, and as it could with respect to all jurisdiction by adopting a different limit than the three-mile limit as it is free to do, or by using a straight base line method which as a matter of international law it is free to do."
1985.35_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2228.182,2237.038,"Mr. Claiborne, he cited a couple of cases that said, as I understood him, sedentary fishing can constitute occupation, or something to that effect."
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2237.928,2272.258,"--There is one such instance involving, as Mr. Herrmann correctly said, the fisheries off Ceylon in which according to Judge Jessup, that particular area has been consistently since a period B.C., been exploited by the people of Ceylon at a time when the difference between governmental and non-governmental activity may have been less clear than it is today."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.684,2301.98,"Mr. Clairborne, did you file exceptions to the Special Master's report?"
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2301.98,2303.213,"We did not, Your Honor."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.213,2313.475,It sounds to me like your argument so far is in the teeth of some of the things the Special Master seemed to say.
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2313.475,2316.865,"Well, again, Your Honor, I must say yes and no."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.083,2330.124,He said that Massachusetts wins unless the clear and convincing evidence standard applies.
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2330.124,2332.249,"--We don't read it that way, Your Honor."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.032,2448.015,Isn't this all about historic title?
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2448.015,2450.109,"I think not, Your Honor."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.881,2481.44,What about the conclusion on page... the carry-over sentence at 65 and 66?
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2481.44,2490.311,"""The Special Master therefore concludes that Massachusetts has failed to meet its burden of establishing historic title to Nantucket Sound. """
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.311,2493.936,Where does it ever... where does this section mention ancient title?
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2493.936,2528.093,"It doesn't, Your Honor, but it mentions the evidence which would be common to both, and it seems to us, he had used the expression 7 of the Convention but there is no getting round the express and unequivocal finding that Massachusetts has presented no evidence of an assertion of sovereignty, and on the contrary that its own evidence proves that it disclaimed--"
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.093,2548.115,"Maybe the only evidence it has it that there was a title to which it fell heir to, and I know you dispute that but do you think it then has to assert title and continuously assert title?"
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2548.115,2586.351,"--Well, the title... even according to the juridical regime... the only authority I may say, on which the Commonwealth appears to clearly rely, the elements of ancient title are that there be a discovery of an area which is not yet appropriated for the general community by the doctrine of open seas, that there be effective occupation of that area, not merely a supposition that some charter may or may not by generally talking about waters--"
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.351,2590.13,"Well, how do you occupy Nantucket Sound?"
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2590.13,2611.761,"--Well, in the same way that you would to prove historic title, by marking it, by legislating about it, by deterring or preventing foreign vessels from entering it, and by exploiting, by license from the government, the resources of the area."
1985.35_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.451,2688.981,May I interrupt you just for a moment.
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2723.827,2727.231,Or because it lacks.
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.155,2765.279,--That would make a whole lot of sense with the final sentence of the paragraph.
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2765.279,2765.857,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.35_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2784.755,2797.812,"Mr. Claiborne, if you look at page 51 of the Master's report, at the end of the paragraph, the one over paragraph at the top, the Master says,"
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2857.584,2868.315,"Justice O'Connor, I must confess that the report seems to us, as to others, less than absolutely clear."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.279,2924.198,"Mr. Claiborne, under D-1, Vineyard Sound, the first sentence says, he concludes that there is historic title to that."
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2936.584,2969.102,"However one reads the Master's report, it does seem to us that the Master has made a finding, on page 65, that whatever rights over Nantucket Sound accrued during the Colonial period, which he suggests were none but whatever they might have been, have long since lapsed by renunciation."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.102,2970.461,"Well, that assumes that--"
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2970.461,2973.695,That finding may in the Master's mind not be relevant to ancient title.
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.348,2990.14,"--His finding is, but that... you want to say that the lapse idea applies to ancient title as well as to historic title?"
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2990.14,3008.57,"It's professed by... it's conceded by Massachusetts that ancient title can be lost, and since ancient title requires to be fortified by long usage, it must follow that it is lost by non-usage and all the more so by express disclaimer."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.57,3022.814,"If you read page 51 as the end of the discussion of ancient title, it's a strange posture to leave the case in if the Master thought that ancient title had lapsed."
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3025.954,3038.356,"Well, one can argue that the rest of the report is superfluous if Massachusetts has proved ancient title."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.356,3039.776,You are going to argue the standard of proof?
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3039.776,3098.283,"Well, with respect to the standard of proof, we submit that this Court has very clearly, and that its Masters have followed what seemed to them the clear lead of the Court, and that the Court has approved the Masters' report, to the effect that when the United States in its sovereign decision disclaims an area never mind when it disclaims it, it is going to be ineffective if it comes too late in the sense that it's not dispositive, but it at least has this effect, so the Court has said, which is to require the State to prove that its historic claim, and that should apply whether it's an ancient title or a so-called historic title, is quite clear and that it is therefore quite wrong and unfair for the United States to come in so late and attempt to defeat it."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.865,3178.595,"You are saying you concede that the State may do that if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence that it had... or beyond that evidence, that it had ancient title?"
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3178.595,3192.948,"--And indeed, that we don't dispute and we must concede that the Court has... but a standard seems to us as we explain in the last section of our brief, to be that clear."
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.948,3201.913,Was it urged by the United States before the Special Master that the notion of lapse did apply to ancient title?
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3201.913,3218.689,"Your Honor, we probably didn't use the word ""lapse"", but we very clearly pointed out and argued at great length that Massachusetts had itself disclaimed through the adoption judicially of a test that wouldn't close Nantucket Sound, and mainly through the legislative--"
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.689,3220.265,What did the Master do with that claim?
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3223.373,3229.308,"--He seems to us, on pages 64 and 65, to have agreed with us entirely that the--"
1985.35_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.308,3238.242,--Why did he leave us with this circular statement on page 51?
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3238.242,3248.738,--I can only repeat that it seems to us that what occurs on page 51 is a step in the process and not a final conclusion with respect to the survival of ancient title.
1985.35_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3304.622,3310.135,"Mr. Claiborne, I'm curious about this clear beyond doubt standard."
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3317.852,3321.914,"I wouldn't have thought so, Justice Blackmun."
1985.35_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3321.914,3323.929,You would not?
1985.35_orig,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3323.929,3324.209,I would not.
1985.35_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3324.209,3331.644,"Anything further, Mr. Herrmann?"
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3331.644,3333.487,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.35_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3333.487,3334.518,You have four minutes remaining.
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3334.518,3336.346,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.35_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.112,3377.172,"You're just saying it must be... that's unfair, that's about your submission, that would just be unfair?"
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3377.172,3380.107,"--No, Justice White."
1985.35_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.576,3385.777,"Don't you think the United States has the power to disclaim it at that point, in fact it has the power at any other time?"
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3385.777,3407.66,"--It has the power to disclaim, but it seems to me, Your Honor, that the issue is what effects this Court will give to an exercise of such power, and it seems to me that the prior decisions of this Court and particularly in the second Louisiana case, page <seventy-seven> [= 77], this Court has made it clear that it and only it will decide in the individual instance what effect to give to this claim."
1985.35_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.66,3410.784,What would you say if the disclaimer had been ten years before this case began?
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3414.096,3425.277,"If the disclaimer had been unequivocal, clearly communicated to foreign nations, and had preceded the outset of the litigation by a full decade, I would say we would have a serious problem, Your Honor."
1985.35_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3425.277,3426.652,"Well, what do you mean by that?"
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3426.652,3427.558,By that I mean--
1985.35_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.558,3429.652,"Do you mean, the beyond doubt standard applies?"
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3429.652,3437.976,"--No, because I don't think the Court meant, if you look at the Louisiana decision, I don't think the Court meant to use the beyond doubt standard in such a fashion."
1985.35_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.587,3477.302,"So, you think the Special Master read our cases completely inaccurately about the standard?"
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3477.302,3479.927,"--I think, Justice--"
1985.35_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.927,3480.723,He relied on it.
1985.35_orig,2,27178,henry_herrmann,,3484.628,3488.534,"--Well, he said... I must submit that he was quite cautious in what he said."
1985.35_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3571.156,3572.703,Thank you gentlemen.
