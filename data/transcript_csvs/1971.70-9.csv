1971.70-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.184,"We will hear arguments next in number 9, Younger against Gilmore."
1971.70-9,0,25832,george_r_nock,,21.152,25.326,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1187.266,1189.722,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1446.134,1450.813,"Mr. Wahl, could I go back to the jurisdictional point and ask one question?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1456.255,1461.681,Not that it was not cited in my brief Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1971.70-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1481.71,1484.596,And Oregon had only one penitentiary?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1484.596,1496.73,"Well, no sir, but I believe the regulation attack there was a time space and method regulation in one particular Oregon prison."
1971.70-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1499.748,1510.456,"In other words, you would distinguish Hatfield rather than take a position that was erroneously decided?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1510.456,1514.548,I would -- I could argue either way Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1971.70-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1514.548,1516.711,As long as you get away from it?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1516.711,1518.441,I do not think the case is a good case.
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1554.17,1567.758,"Well you mentioned, it used to be enacted in California Statute that inmates may have law books in their cells?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1567.758,1569.868,"Yes, Your Honor, Justice Brennan."
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1602.115,1606.1,"Well, what citation is that?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1606.1,1606.431,The --
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1606.431,1609.328,I suppose it must be based on cases of sometime?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1609.328,1610.147,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1637.752,1645.957,"Well, do you find then in strength to your position the equal protection position in that fact?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1645.957,1648.437,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1683.124,1685.585,So he may supplement.
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1693.15,1694.201,"Yes, he may."
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1694.201,1697.066,Whereas you suggest the indigent canno6t?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1697.066,1700.268,The indigent may not or cannot.
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1700.268,1712.351,"Mr. Wahl, in this building as you know we have an expanded library with many thousands of volumes and the Department of Justice has a comparable library of many thousands of books."
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1735.076,1742.718,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think this is the most difficult question, but it is the question which we squarely need."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1752.863,1754.545,Let us narrow it down.
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1767.271,1767.979,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1776.631,1779.317,How many volumes is that?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1779.317,1780.504,I would say --
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.504,1782.309,And which volumes?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1789.413,1805.59,In the argument in the Court below Judge Zercoli (ph) asked Mr. Nock and myself if we could coordinate on establishing a list of law books for California prisons.
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1805.59,1810.145,Did Judge Zercoli have some idea that you could speak for all the inmates of the prisoners in California?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1810.145,1827.467,"I think he only asked the question, Your Honor and I said that I would consider this one of the most weighty responsibilities that anybody could have, but I would attempt it because it would be better than the present situation."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.671,1842.08,"As a matter of policy, but is not as a matter of constitution, I think, a very narrow limitation on that?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1842.08,1844.075,"Well, he does not say that the â€“-"
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1844.075,1845.66,He did in oral argument.
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1856.01,1880.732,"Yes, I believe though that when he admits in his opening brief on page 22, the three additional law books in the prison libraries giving knowledge of venue, jurisdiction, proper parties, respondent and exhaustion of remedies and perhaps hopefully does not say this even proper remedies."
1971.70-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1918.593,1926.96,"I might say that multiple pages printed, I think it is document which he just fill in the blanks?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1926.96,1930.294,"Well, Your Honor that is no substitute for law books."
1971.70-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1931.211,1935.303,In favor of substantive law I wonder what value do you put on it?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,1935.303,1937.265,I put very little value.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.208,2025.207,Could I ask you about the (Inaudible) orders upon -- at what stage in final relief proceeding an attorney (Inaudible) California Court?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2025.207,2039.364,"In general, Your Honor and I cannot speak for all proceedings, I have been appointed in one proceeding myself and that was in a petition for writ of coram nobis."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.55,2059.283,So counsel is not automatically defined in the collateral proceedings immediately from the filing of the petition?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2059.283,2060.966,"No he is not, he is not."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.076,2064.46,The (Voice Overlap) court decides that there is substance to it?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2064.46,2066.737,Only when the court decides there is some substance to it.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.737,2068.385,Then counsel is appointed?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2068.385,2069.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.721,2073.164,Do you think you can adjust the proceeding in the Lower Court?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2073.164,2073.621,Right.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.621,2074.759,And then on appeal?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2074.759,2075.686,And on Appeal.
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2075.686,2083.34,Does that uniformly true in all the counties of California or only some?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2083.34,2085.705,"I believe it is true throughout the state, Your Honor."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.705,2093.159,Is that under a statute or a court rule or what?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2093.159,2107.675,A counsel may be appointed pursuant to two statutes that are part of the California Penal Code for trial court or personal proceedings and for appellant proceedings.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.465,2135.992,Do you think that with some effort it might take a year and so you and someone else could make up a handbook on habeas corpus with the forms and some fundamental ground rules that would be adequate in your terms to guide an indigent prisoner?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2135.992,2140.435,"I am sure that somebody could do this, but it would have to be more than a handbook."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.606,2148.21,"That is what I mean, a loose (inaudible) would be kept for today?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2148.21,2148.568,Yes.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.568,2151.118,Fundamental rules book?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2151.118,2160.35,"Watkins Criminal Procedure was cited by counsel earlier and I was fairly certain, but I checked during the noon hour and it is supplemented every two years."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.131,2235.925,"(Inaudible) what does in your position or the findings of the three-judge court, anything that show that any of the named plaintiffs have the disadvantage to the trial with respect to the regulations that they are now talking about, namely they (Inaudible) had wanted to file or were in the concept of filing and that they have been denied the books that they needed."
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2242.48,2248.591,"I believe that there was in the original complaint not into this, in the original complaint."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.361,2254.785,It is a class action?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2254.785,2256.259,It is not approved class action.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.488,2259.101,We are talking about the main parties?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2259.101,2260.215,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.193,2289.264,(Inaudible) these regulations on these people aside from the restrictions which apparently points out the case on the regulation of loaning of equal material and one person to another or is there any (Inaudible) to help us?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2289.264,2297.027,"Mr. Justice White I think you are referring to the regulations prohibiting inmates for owning not loaning, owning personally own law books."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.027,2300.287,Right and I would like that.
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2300.287,2307.525,Yes that is what -- California still prohibits inmates from loaning material back and forth.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.525,2309.091,Is that an issue in this case?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2309.091,2310.839,It was an issue in the Lower Court.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.688,2316.278,So that is not an issue before us?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2316.278,2325.146,"Well, only insofar as its part of the basic sub-stratum of the whole opinion."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.472,2346.351,But I do not see anything in front of the District Court showing at least particular plaintiffs together (Inaudible)?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2346.351,2365.603,"I believe, Your Honor and the reason I say I believe is because I have not read the original complaint as opposed to the amended complaint for a long time, but I believe that they alleged specifically that the denial of law books infringed their ability to file post conviction petitions and actions under the Civil Rights Act of 1871."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.331,2378.844,"Well, after all you do not need to teach your plaintiff, it must be learned lawyer?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2378.844,2379.773,Robert --
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.773,2386.276,(Inaudible)
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2386.276,2388.512,Robert O. Gilmore Jr. is not Your Honor.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.942,2402.63,"(Inaudible), right?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2402.63,2424.009,"He may have attained a good knowledge of law over the years, but I think even a lawyer, if I were incarcerated without the use of law books I would hate to rely on my memory because my memory would stop, the one thing as of the moment of my incarceration."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2472.603,2474.41,How many sets they need to prisons?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2474.41,2476.576,One set perhaps in each prison.
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2476.576,2501.081,"Mr. Wahl, if you prevail I take it and we have to lay down some kind of standard that we have let us say constitutional right (Inaudible) could, what do you suggest have you say earlier something about whatever maybe adequate or the need, what does that mean?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2501.081,2514.57,"Your Honor, I almost have to go back to the kind of thinking that that was followed by this Court before you overruled Bates versus Brady."
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2541.964,2549.435,"Does this order suggest that, I thought the order did nothing more than say this regulations are no good."
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2559.866,2570.224,"No, Your Honor it is not specific standard, it is not by saying these reports or those reports or these Courts."
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.224,2573.842,Is the existing list adequate?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2573.842,2593.218,It said that the existing list was inadequate and that some regulation should be promulgated which will provide the first instance petitioner with enough access through the law to allow him meaningful access to the Courts on the first time he files his petition.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.218,2600.328,And none of these things on the list would satisfy because they are having that position?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2602.837,2606.534,"Your Honor, the way the State law Library works --"
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.534,2608.079,With the access?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2608.079,2611.619,"No, no the law -- the state law library is complete."
1971.70-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2628.476,2646.76,"Mr. Wahl, assuming that this Court should jot down a list of books which the prisons in California has to have, Federal Reports, US Reports, (Inaudible)."
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2661.232,2665.231,"Well, Your Honor I do not know the answer to that but I think that constitution --"
1971.70-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2665.231,2670.054,"Well you do not want us to supervise the library to the prison, do you?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2670.054,2672.01,"No, I do not want."
1971.70-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2672.01,2676.025,What compromise we have between that and doing nothing to offer?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2676.025,2688.545,"I do not think we reach that question because I think that the only question here is whether this order which requires, which asks for new regulations should stand or fall or be modified."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2688.545,2696.575,Do you not think the State of California was entitled to the benefit of the wisdom of these three judges who have this idea on what it would -- what would satisfy them?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2696.575,2698.89,"Yes, Your Honor I do."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.89,2701.199,Did they give any indication of what they have in mind?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2701.199,2704.645,"They basically ordered the state to come up with new regulation, Your Honor."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.645,2709.013,"Yeah, but what book, what book?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2713.112,2715.573,"Well, Your Honor they did not require books."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2715.573,2717.729,"Well, what did they require?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2717.729,2724.428,They pointed out three examples and the judges said of course the alternatives are legend.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.569,2745.3,"Does any county of the state has legal aid, the body or public defender or something like that who is available at all to a prisoner who wants to file a petition?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2745.3,2749.167,There is legislation.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.668,2781.972,There is no some public defender who is present to extend to answering any call for help if a prisoner wants to file a petition?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2781.972,2783.488,Not to my knowledge.
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2784.641,2792.292,"Mr. Wahl, If there were something like that, you probably would not be here asking for books in the prison library, would you?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2792.292,2792.588,That is correct.
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2792.588,2798.347,If there were a provision that any inmate will have the services of counsel?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2798.347,2800.467,That is correct.
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.502,2825.578,When you get through with the body of petition or maybe these people will have lawyers?
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2825.578,2831.449,Some places have experimented with placing a legal aid lawyer right in the institution.
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2837.113,2838.48,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1971.70-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2838.48,2840.286,"They have had the student programs, have they not?"
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2840.286,2844.881,They have had some attempts to take students out to the prisons?
1971.70-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.881,2849.642,But you say that proposed legislation looks forward to this area?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2849.642,2853.982,This is my understanding and I believe it has not passed even one house here.
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2892.169,2895.702,You do not think it had?
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2895.702,2899.622,I think that the effect of it has been practical --
1971.70-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2899.622,2904.275,From advantage point I would say that is longer --
1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,2904.275,2910.485,"Well, the practical of that in this case I think would be therapeutic and educational."

1971.70-9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3044.607,3047.094,Are those forms in the original record?

1971.70-9,1,33405,john_eshleman_wahl,,3053.533,3054.209,They are.
1971.70-9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3054.209,3060.258,"In California, all of the state and Federal Courts, that is appropriate ones where such briefs can be filed?"
