1987.87-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.794,"We will hear arguments next in Randolph Riley, Etcetera, Et Al."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,13.714,26.817,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the honorable Court, North Carolina is here today because of the lower courts' interpretations of your decisions in the Munson and Schaumburg."
1987.87-328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.246,282.59,Excuse me.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,344.408,369.991,"--Your Honor, we require that of the charities, although they are not... and through these fundraisers they are not involved, of course, in soliciting the funds, and what we are trying to say is that this fundraiser should make a disclosure to the prospective donor precisely what percent of the money is going to the charity so that the donor will have in mind what the costs are as to the fundraiser."
1987.87-328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.991,379.94,"You require the charities in North Carolina to tell the donors how much of the money it is getting for, let's say, hunger relief in wherever, will go there?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,379.94,385.22,"We require, Your Honor, that they file it with the regulator and it is available on request."
1987.87-328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.935,395.824,"These people have no objection to that, to filing it and having it available on request, as I understand what they are saying here."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,395.824,399.822,"I think that is correct, but they do object to making the disclosure at the time of solicitation."
1987.87-328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.822,404.555,But you don't require the charities themselves to make that much more... much more pertinent disclosure.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,404.555,424.251,"If the charities themselves are involved in the solicitation, that is correct, Your Honor, but there is a substantial difference between the commercial operator and the charity itself which of course is the end user of the funds, and taking the property or the funds and using it for the purpose that has been established and its goals that have been established."
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,424.251,426.484,"Well, I guess there are two cuts being taken."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,445.975,446.913,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.913,454.817,"Your law that we are looking at relates to the first cut, that taken by the professional fundraiser."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,454.817,466.859,"Exactly, and what we are hoping is that this point of solicitation disclosure would bring some interest to bear for the prospective donor on just what is happening to the money, at least in the beginning."
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.859,474.933,"I suppose we look at it under the reasonable time, place, and manner sort of analysis?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,476.994,478.197,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that's correct."
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.197,478.447,All right.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,494.675,503.047,About 95 percent of them are telephone solicitations dealing with some type of show or entertainment.
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,504.281,506.702,For relatively small amounts.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,509.2,510.076,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.076,511.777,On behalf of some charity.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,511.777,512.683,Exactly.
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,512.683,529.395,"And North Carolina thinks that having the telephone caller, if it is a professional solicitor, tell the person being called, who is answering the telephone, that over the past year, is it?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,529.395,530.145,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,530.145,541.921,"That the average amount that this particular fundraiser raised, a certain percentage was kept for the fundraiser's fees and expenses?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,541.921,546.343,"A certain amount was returned to the charity, and the average--"
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,546.343,548.107,"That is sort of a complicated explanation, isn't it?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,548.107,555.134,"--Well, it could bring on a complicated explanation if the fundraiser chose to use it."
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.632,575.814,You think it would be more reasonable to have the person just disclose that it is a professional fundraiser making the call and that some portion of it will be retained and not given to the charity?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,575.814,593.479,We think that the minimum amount of information that should be made available would include this number as to what percentage had previously been returned to the charity so that the perceptive donor would understand how much of their money is actually going to a charitable purpose.
1987.87-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,593.479,596.851,"But what was done before wouldn't tell you what is going to happen this time, would it?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,596.851,601.616,"Well, most of the time you rely on past experience to suggest what the future may be, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,615.626,620.608,"Of course, you are almost killing every donation by telephone by requiring this, aren't you?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,620.608,621.858,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.852,640.88,"Well, it is one thing to disclose... make them disclose what they are going to charge."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,664.981,678.741,"Your Honor, if it is the same type of litigation, he certainly ought to have some idea as to what the cost is going to be, and in the Zauderer case you said to the lawyer that he had to disclose some information about cost, at least that the costs were going to be there."
1987.87-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,682.208,684.426,You may finish your answer to Justice Scalia's question at 1:00 o'clock.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,684.426,684.909,All right.
1987.87-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,686.519,691.969,"Mr. Thornburg, You may continue."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,691.969,693.579,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.071,873.741,"General Thornburg, suppose... you say this is just commercial and has nothing to do with free speech rights."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,908.086,923.968,"I think we could do that if it's strictly commercial aspects, Your Honor, and that's what we are trying to say, is, if you use... if you are paying somebody to do that, then you have to reveal at the point of... at the point of solicitation a disclosure as to what your practice has been."
1987.87-328,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.952,1093.947,"Doesn't this approach, though, make it awfully tough on the charities who rely on expensive events to raise their money?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1101.117,1104.069,"Yes, and all of that is provided for, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.386,1138.945,"Well, I suppose the basis for the invalidation was the First Amendment, is that it, in the court below?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1138.945,1139.883,Yes.
1987.87-328,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.258,1147.52,"And what was the argument, that disclosure burdens First Amendment rights?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1149.677,1149.911,Yes.
1987.87-328,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.911,1154.502,--By saying I... if last year my experience was so and so--
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1154.502,1162.373,"That you are effectively chilling the rights of the charity to be heard, and that, of course, is the interpretation."
1987.87-328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1188.237,1194.268,--Reasonableness is determined on a case by case basis?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1194.268,1195.126,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1199.999,1204.387,What happens if a charity has high hopes but the fundraising thing is something of a flop?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1214.415,1214.977,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1218.382,1220.85,Are there any statutory criteria for reasonableness?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1220.85,1221.49,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1221.49,1223.053,And what are they?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1223.053,1226.832,"The statute sets up these percentages, 20 percent--"
1987.87-328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1226.832,1230.518,"I understand the percentages, but other than that the only touchstone is reasonableness?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1230.518,1241.17,"--It is reasonableness with speech aspect, dissemination of information and so forth, if I understand Your Honor's question."
1987.87-328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1272.126,1276.797,But the statute doesn't even say reasonable in relation to what?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1282.84,1287.541,"Reasonable in relation to all the facts before the regulator, the hearing officer, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.447,1302.926,"But time, place, and manner regulations must be neutral and can't afford the... any latitude for discretion, and it seems to me this is an open-ended standard."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1302.926,1314.609,"There are minimum require Your Honor, dealing with speech that we put in there that the legislature sets out."
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1347.814,1352.093,"Mr. Attorney General, do you say that this is a business tax?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1352.093,1353.78,"A business tax, Your Honor?"
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1353.78,1354.061,Yes.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1354.061,1357.545,"No, Your Honor, it is an effort to--"
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1357.545,1361.496,"Well, do you treat charities like like any other business in North Carolina?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1361.496,1363.354,"--No, Your Honor, we give them special--"
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1363.354,1364.417,I thought so.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1364.417,1382.191,"--Yes, sir, we do, and we are saying that these fundraisers who are going out and getting the money are just keeping too much of it, and we want more of it to go back to the charity, and that the state has a right to say your costs have got to be reasonable."
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1382.191,1383.253,They have got to ask for this.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1383.253,1386.485,There are a variety and number.
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1388.891,1391.625,"The Attorney General was [inaudible], wasn't it?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1391.625,1393.218,"--No, I don't believe--"
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1393.218,1394.53,Wasn't that the one who asked for it?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1394.53,1396.685,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1398.668,1414.208,"General Thornburg, religious corporations, churches often hire professionals when they are making a new building or some capital investment."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1418.161,1419.175,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1419.175,1421.238,Why do you have that?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1421.238,1428.859,"Because, I think the best answer to that, Your Honor, is simply, we just don't have the problems with those folks."
1987.87-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1434.951,1441.62,"Well, churches, I have known churches that hire fundraisers for profit and for hire."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1441.62,1445.039,We just simply in North Carolina don't have that problem.
1987.87-328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.219,1476.121,"General, the problem... I find it hard to credit your argument that you are helping the charities here and protecting them against something."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1491.193,1501.251,"Because we think... first of all, we think that the case has been misrepresented and missold to the charities."
1987.87-328,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.218,1554.839,Maybe it wants to determine for itself what is a reasonable price for it to pay to get its message across and doesn't want you to determine it for it.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1555.839,1570.082,"It has the right to contract and then the donor, the attorney general, the charity has a right to contest if this is found to be unreasonable or if you don't have these formulas involved."
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1570.082,1576.362,"Well, if the charity wants to spend 80 percent, what right have you to say they can't?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1576.362,1584.999,"Your Honor, these... the State of North Carolina stands in a parens patriae relationship in regard to charitable funds."
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1598.041,1607.645,Can you stop the charity from buying a porch that is worth $5 and paying $5 million for it?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1609.348,1612.222,A porch?
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1613.392,1617.329,Could you stop them from throwing their money away?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1617.329,1623.905,"--No, I think not, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1623.905,1625.247,"Well, isn't that what you are doing here?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1625.247,1639.368,"No, I think we are regulating at the right place, and that is where the first cut comes, and we are simply saying that the charity... that we are regulating a commercial operation."
1987.87-328,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.549,1654.361,May I just ask you one other question?
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1654.361,1654.955,Yes.
1987.87-328,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.955,1666.154,"Justice Blackmun asked about the religious exemption, and this... one of the interests you seek to serve is that the donor know how much of the donation will go to the charity."
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1671.698,1678.43,"Your Honor, I wish... I wish we could control the television ministries--"
1987.87-328,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1678.43,1679.335,"Well, why couldn't this--"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1679.335,1694.125,"--but I'm not sure we could because I think, of course, I think speech rights are very definitely involved totally there, and you have the problems that, yes, that would be involved, but we are not trying to do that."
1987.87-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1729.627,1735.108,"--General, do you concede that the heightened scrutiny is the proper standard?"
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1735.108,1737.686,In this instance?
1987.87-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1737.686,1737.905,Yes.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1737.905,1738.905,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1738.905,1740.466,I thought you just--
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1740.466,1742.622,"No, I say that it does not apply."
1987.87-328,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1742.622,1743.247,--I thought you just mentioned that you did.
1987.87-328,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1743.247,1747.589,"No, I meant to say that we say the heightened scrutiny test does not apply."
1987.87-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1749.759,1753.055,"Thank you, General Thornburg."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,1755.882,1767.098,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the value of speech is its content, not its source."
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.178,1851.171,"Could I ask you, is it feasible in your mind to separate the professional fundraisers who help the charities get their message out and those who just raise money?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,1851.171,1862.573,Where the professional representative is acting as a conduit or an agent of the charitable organization's speech it is not possible to separate that out.
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.573,1870.913,"Well, the charity hires a professional fundraiser to raise some money."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,1892.295,1911.912,"I think the important thing to keep in mind, and the important consideration is the message of the charity, and when a professional representative is speaking for the charity, taking their message forward and seeking financial support, he is also involved in an activity that includes the dissemination of information."
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.282,1925.876,Just asking for money?
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,1925.876,1927.172,I think--
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.172,1932.123,"I get telephone calls that say, I am calling for a certain organization."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,1944.961,1964.923,"--If I call you for the National Federation of the Plind of North Carolina, I am calling you on behalf of their causes and what they represent, and if you know what those causes are and accept what they represent and want to answer with your financial support, I think we have been involved in an aspect of speech."
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.923,1982.056,"--You are arguing then that there is no, there is just no situation in which the restrictions may be applied, for instance, the licensing provision could not be applied to any professional fundraisers for a charity?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,1982.056,1984.837,"No, I don't believe that that is a correct statement of what I am saying."
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.601,1988.445,"Well, here is a professional fundraiser for a charity."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,1997.019,2027.865,"--But this Court has ruled in both Schaumberg and Munson that you can have a disclosure by registration and by passing certain rigid standards to quality that professional to act, and in the State of North Carolina and in this case the lower court held that it was not a burden on the charity's free speech right to have that person identify not only their name but the fact that they were a professional, giving the name and the address of those that they worked for."
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.865,2035.051,"Well, I know, but that isn't all that this North Carolina scheme does in licensing, does it?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2035.051,2038.736,"Well, if we are talking about the licensing of the--"
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.736,2038.908,That's what I am.
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2038.908,2049.232,"--professional fundraiser, the licensing provision is standardless, and the Court invalidated it because it did not comply with Shuttlesworth--"
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.232,2049.732,All right.
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2058.838,2071.426,"--There were certain other provisions of the North Carolina registration requirements for professional representatives that were not challenged, that are still on the books, and that are still being complied with by professional representatives."
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.426,2072.488,What about the licensing provisions?
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2072.488,2095.526,"There is still a license being issued and granted because there are requirements to file a bond and file certain information, and this provision amended an existing provision that required the providing of information, the filing of a bond, and the filing of financial reports, all of which were things that this Court pointed to in Schaumberg, and that is what is in place in North Carolina today."
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.526,2115.33,"Mr. Copilevitz, do you think a state could regulate the price of theater tickets, put a maximum price on theater tickets, or do you think the... could the theater object that you are suppressing the playwright's free speech if you do that?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2115.33,2127.294,I don't know that a state could impose a maximum price on a theater ticket unless there was a given consideration that was a substantial state interest to do that.
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2127.294,2138.229,"In other words, you don't think that a state has police power to, say, set maximum prices for bread like we said they did in Nebbia versus New York, and cases like that?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2138.229,2140.697,I think that where there is a compelling state interest--
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.697,2143.382,"Well, but did Nebbia say anything about compelling state interest?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2143.382,2146.194,"--Well, in this case we are dealing with a speech interest."
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.194,2147.007,"No, I mean, I asked you about Nebbia."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2147.007,2148.365,"No, sir."
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.365,2150.505,Nebbia just said it is within the police power of the state.
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2154.346,2157.782,It would depend upon what the state's interest in doing that.
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2166.919,2177.166,"Well, supposing the state says we want a lot of people to be able to go to the theater, just like we want a lot of people to be able to buy bread."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2177.665,2189.723,"I think in that circumstance you probably could, but I think that in this circumstance where we are dealing with the burden on free speech there are other considerations at hand."
1987.87-328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.02,2200.375,Do you think the state could put a maximum price on how much a political organization can rent a hall for a political rally?
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2200.375,2202.218,"--No, sir, I do not."
1987.87-328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.218,2217.446,"So I guess what we are talking about on your view of it is whether this is closer to a political type speech than it is to whatever normal theater speech would be, on your view."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2217.446,2285.84,"Well, this Court has held twice in this decade that this... the activity of charitable solicitation is the functional equivalent of political speech, and when you impact that you take different considerations into effect as you do in an outright commercial situation, and the impact on the free speech interest here is illustrated by the example that the Court made earlier this morning where under the existing North Carolina law if it were not challenged and I were calling you on a controversial type of issue, let's say Contra aid, whether I am for it or against it, involving an organization that is involved in advocacy on one side of that question and wants financial support to accomplish some of the goals to further its aims, its program service, when I call you under this law as it is written I have to begin my telephone conversation by identifying my name, the name of the company that I work for, their address, what their track record was for the preceding 12 months of delivering funds to charitable organizations in North Carolina--"
1987.87-328,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2285.84,2289.775,"Well, Mr. Copilevitz, that, of course, is the disclosure section."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2312.454,2314.11,--It is--
1987.87-328,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2314.11,2319.904,It really isn't a limitation on amount that can be collected if it is necessary for advocacy.
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2319.904,2322.105,--It is theoretically possible.
1987.87-328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.11,2547.906,"Well, that is not really dispositive."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2560.54,2562.321,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.321,2572.723,"And a fundraiser might say, well, given the choice of fundraising in North Carolina or somewhere else that doesn't have the tax, I will just stay out of North Carolina, but that wouldn't make it unconstitutional, would it?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2572.723,2581.11,"Well, if they are staying out of North Carolina because the statutory scheme creates a prior restraint, it is the charities that are complaining."
1987.87-328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.078,2585.781,"Well, if it's a prior restraint, fine."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2597.058,2614.253,"But we are talking about them as a class of... a medium for a certain group, a certain size of charitable organizations, and this certain group or class of charitable organizations is being joined by the larger and the most substantial charitable organizations in this country."
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.253,2621.173,Probably a lot of bucket shop operators had the same reaction to states which passed blue sky laws requiring securities disclosure.
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2628.967,2634.339,"From the aspect of the charity are talking about a free speech interest as compared to a commercial speech, and--"
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.339,2644.584,"Well, probably the corporations that... whose stock is being sold by bucket shop operators could mae the same contention, that they were complaining, they didn't like the blue sky laws, either."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2644.584,2661.547,"--Well, I would take exception with the example and illustrate it perhaps by the Zauderer case, which the state has relied on a great deal, that says that the advertising of a lawyer can be regulated as to his client, as to potential clients."
1987.87-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.87,2716.776,I assume we can rule against you and not touch the lawyers.
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2716.776,2721.96,--I don't think that is possible.
1987.87-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.334,2724.896,Try me.
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2726.66,2729.957,I think I will decline.
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.536,2885.426,If you are going to rely on the First Amendment how did it infringe First Amendment rights?
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2890.783,2917.102,"--What burdens the First Amendment rights is that when you are dealing with face to face solicitation, or telephone solicitation, as this Court said in Members of the City Council of Los Angeles versus Benson, that face to face solicitation and telephone is entitled to extra consideration because of the nature of the activity."
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.582,2925.846,So?
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2925.846,2952.382,"--So that when the state requires me that in addition to being able and before I can give the message of those I represent I have to tell you my name, the name of the company I work for, their address, and what that company's track record is for the preceding 12 months, by the time that I get to talk to you about the message of the National Federation of the Blind and their interest in advocacy on the right of blind citizens, I will have received a dial tone."
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.677,2968.47,"I would think... I would think you would challenge on the same grounds, the requirement that you give that information if it is required."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2975.75,2979.341,I don't think that there is the same constitutional problem.
1987.87-328,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.385,2995.788,"After all, if you... I guess then you could just hang up if you didn't want to give the information, I guess."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,2995.788,2999.661,If you could not get the information you would hang up.
1987.87-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.848,3246.811,"May I ask if your argument applies equally to telephone... I know in the strongest context over the telephone because people probably hang up pretty fast, but what about a written disclosure?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3251.621,3254.182,I don't believe that written disclosure is harmful at all.
1987.87-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.792,3257.697,"In other words, this would be all right if applied merely to written solicitations?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3257.697,3265.646,"--If it only was required to be given in writing, even before a person parted with consideration--"
1987.87-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.646,3268.911,"And even to the donor, not just to a central place where they can call up and get the information."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3268.911,3275.752,--I don't believe that that creates the constitutional problems that point of solicitation oral disclosure--
1987.87-328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.752,3279.079,"Well, you would still have the problem that it doesn't mean anything."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3286.122,3290.684,"--But what it does is, it gives the charity a chance to explain figures and amplify."
1987.87-328,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3290.684,3291.043,--I see.
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3291.043,3313.159,"It gives them the context of allowing you to understand what it's all about, and that form the charity needs because worthy charities have high costs, and if they have to start by telling you that they have high costs, and that professionals are involved, and all these other things, they are never going to receive your support."
1987.87-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3313.159,3325.81,"Counsel, do you have any answer to the statement made by the Attorney General that the study shows practically all of the charities only get 20 percent?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3325.81,3337.477,"Well, I think what the Attorney General said is that they picked out five particular professional fundraisers and as to those five the studies showed 20 percent."
1987.87-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3339.586,3340.586,What does the record show?
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3340.586,3345.085,--I don't know what the overall record of the State of North Carolina would show.
1987.87-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3345.085,3348.253,"You mean, this is not in the record in this case?"
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3348.253,3352.252,"This is in the record as to, I believe, five different companies."
1987.87-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3354.735,3364.466,"If he is telling us the truth, and I certainly assume he is, it is the five largest for profit professional fundraisers licensed between 1980 and 1984 in North Carolina, the five largest."
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3364.466,3387.097,"--I would suggest to you that the records also show from Mr. Edgerton's deposition that there's many times the number of five professional fundraising representatives that are licensed to work in the State of North Carolina, and that North Carolina would be better served to enforce its existing statutes and require the disclosure of professional fundraisers to the charities as to what kind of track record they have."
1987.87-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3391.034,3393.345,May I just go back?
1987.87-328,1,22064,errol_copilevitz,,3405.199,3407.839,I am willing to live with the introductory part.
1987.87-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3445.714,3449.072,"Thank you, Mr. Copilevitz."
1987.87-328,2,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,3451.994,3452.946,"Nothing further, Your Honor."
1987.87-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3452.946,3453.602,Very well.
