1975.74-884,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.63,"We will hear arguments next in United States against Powell, 74-884."
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,46.555,49.846,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-884,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,126.427,128.384,What are the dimensions of this shotgun?
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,128.384,138.208,"This shotgun had a barrel length of 10-inches and an overall length of 22-inches, actually 22 and 1/8-inches including the stock and the barrel."
1975.74-884,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,138.208,139.613,So it is well within the regulation?
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,139.613,156.187,It is well within the regulations and in fact it is well within the numerical definitions set out in other Federal Statutes and in the Washington State Statutes prohibits the possession of similar sort-of shotguns with barrels less than 12-inches in length.
1975.74-884,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.078,249.43,Did the Court order (Inaudible)
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,249.43,249.652,No.
1975.74-884,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,261.379,262.814,That issue is still open --.
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,262.814,265.695,That issue is still open and it will be open on remand.
1975.74-884,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.408,289.46,(Inaudible).
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,289.46,290.54,In this case.
1975.74-884,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.54,297.587,(Inaudible) by saying it is a sort-of shotgun.
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,297.587,301.973,That there are at least some sort-of shotguns plainly within that statute and —
1975.74-884,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.973,307.649,"If you made that argument and we agreed with you, the issue would not be over."
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,307.649,313.032,If you agreed as to the argument as to all sort-of shotguns then it would not be open on remand.
1975.74-884,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.032,324.827,"Would not that be a matter of fact, would you have to prove that as part of your case if you came in there with that 20-inch barrel?"
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,324.827,329.658,"Well, we proved as part of our case in this case that this particular weapon —"
1975.74-884,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.658,343.031,"If you prevail on this vagueness and if you prevail in asking us to reverse the judgment on this case, you would nonetheless have -- would you not have a burden proof in an ordinary prosecution of proving that this weapon is capable of being concealed on the person."
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,343.031,344.158,"Yes, we would and that would be an issue –"
1975.74-884,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,344.158,346.517,The Jury satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt.
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,346.517,347.87,That is correct.
1975.74-884,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,352.209,363.243,"Mr. Easterbrook, the only evidence in this case on that issue was to the effect that this weapon was capable of being concealed on the person."
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,365.54,367.984,We do not believe there is any conflict on the evidence.
1975.74-884,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,367.984,370.081,Is there any evidence to the contrary?
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,370.081,392.385,One Federal Agent testified that the weapon was bulky enough that it might cause a bulge and might cause a bulge under the clothing if it is attempted to be concealed under the clothing and I think that created a fair issue for the Jury whether that bulge was so observable that the weapon was not capable of being concealed on the person in a realistic sense.
1975.74-884,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,392.385,403.256,"Mr. Easterbrook, the word person is that a five foot or seven foot, 500 pound or 200 pound or 100 pound person."
1975.74-884,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,404.915,408.82,The statute did not define the term 'person' Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1335.82,1340.656,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1425.918,1427.95,Does this include all shotguns?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1427.95,1435.324,I believe it depends on the Court of Appeals since it only had the evidence of one shotgun of a specific dimension was referring then to that shotgun.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1435.324,1436.294,Does this include all shotgun.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1436.294,1436.442,No.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1442.669,1446.334,If you take that then you are not talking about a shotgun.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1446.334,1447.619,A specific shotgun which was the—
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1447.619,1449.707,This becomes the jury question.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1449.707,1455.287,"Well, that becomes a question then, it becomes a jury question if properly submitted to the jury."
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1497.044,1507.161,"Mr. Moberg, did not -- I am looking at page 3A of the Government’s Petition of certiorari where the Court of Appeals opinion is set up."
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1518.775,1524.954,I believe that there is language in that that could support in a very narrow reading that it would apply to other firearms.
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.155,1572.188,"But what they said on 3A was this, having decided the unconstitutional vagueness of the statute as it is applied to “other firearms”."
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1577.613,1579.543,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.582,1628.085,"Well, but look at the paragraph above the paragraph I was just reading from page 3A on the petition, was that to require Congress to delimit the size of the firearms other than pistols and revolvers."
1975.74-884,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1637.819,1649.201,And is that not a holding that has applied to other firearms i.e. shotguns it is void on its face.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1649.201,1692.282,"It would be my reading of the opinion that is not that broad of a holding or that the Court was referring then principally to the sort-of shotgun as being an other firearm and on that basis it was vague and then I think in -- rather dicta in this opinion said that this firearm provision could be rather more precisely drawn but I do not believe that that was necessary to the resolution of the case as applied to the appellant at that point, the respondent in this case."
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.715,1753.604,"No, would you need an expert testimony in a case like this?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1758.818,1766.907,"Well, I would answer the first part of that question that, no you would not need an expert in regards to the testimony."
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.677,1788.378,"How was that ordinarily determined, it is determined by a ruling of the Trial Judge, is it not that there is sufficient evidence to go to the Jury, not by some expert getting up and testifying."
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1788.378,1788.93,That is correct.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1807.577,1817.403,"Could you tell the Jury that this gun can be concealed on a person, what was the expertise of the expert?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1817.403,1821.898,He was a Tobacco and Firearms agent of—
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1821.898,1824.913,"Well, would you have a clothing man in there?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1824.913,1825.427,[Laughter]
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.427,1831.14,I mean who is the expert on what you can conceal in clothing?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1835.912,1850.467,"Well, I would say Mr. Justice that it is not a question that is exclusively within expert testimony but that expert testimony does not make it any more or less difficult determination."
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1864.421,1869.818,"For example, an expert says almost all firearms can be, do you want to say that?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1869.818,1870.58,That is what he said.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.982,1876.266,Did he say all firearms?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1881.423,1895.995,"I believe that he said the literal context of the appendix was that he said that almost any firearm could be concealed and I think the importer’s remarks was that, it does not take a great deal of a problem to conceal."
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.995,1901.019,My final question did the Judge instructed jury on the expert?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1901.019,1904.408,"Yes, it was an instruction on expert testimony presented."
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1904.408,1906.769,Did not somebody object to it?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1906.769,1917.299,"Well, at that point through the trial, we were raising the objection that it was not a jury question at all and therefore not even properly subject to expert testimony."
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1941.274,1949.968,(Inaudible) sort-of shotguns given to the statute?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1949.968,1956.056,Eight-inches in entire length.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1968.341,1972.19,That eight inch shotgun would be a shoulder type weapon?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1972.19,1975.287,It is a shoulder class of weapon.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1975.287,1979.157,"(Inaudible), how does he shoot?[Laughter]"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1979.157,1992.87,"Well, I think that the testimony was in fact that if you have a sort-of shotgun that you need to shoot it from the shoulder or from the hip and as distinguished from a pistol because of the certain recoil characteristics of the sort-of shotgun."
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1992.87,1997.127,"But the point is that the weapon can be concealed, that is the point."
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,1997.127,1998.946,That is correct and I think that the statute --
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1998.946,2001.363,And you cannot ignore that point.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2007.374,2020.423,"Well, I am not saying that in terms of this case, except that the Government would have a stronger position to urge in regards to sort-of shotguns of that dimension."
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2020.423,2023.229,Are you saying that this shotgun is outside?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2023.229,2023.604,Yes.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2026.086,2028.362,But that is not what the Court ruled.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2030.835,2031.939,"Well, it gets back to them."
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.163,2060.777,"Well, this is a 22-inch quite in length and bulky."
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2060.777,2061.299,That is correct.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2061.299,2069.556,And that applies -- that Court's opinion applies to all 22.8-inch sort-of shotguns that are bulky.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2069.556,2071.396,That is correct.
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2071.396,2074.648,Will you tell me what bulky is?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2075.918,2086.312,"Okay, bulky in terms of size, in terms of width, weight-"
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2086.312,2087.364,How much width?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2091.801,2094.293,I believe at that point there was—
1975.74-884,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.293,2102.806,(Inaudible)
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2102.806,2117.748,"The question before the Court of Appeals was whether or not the statute as it was written would apply to the respondent in that particular case and the shotgun that the respondent had, that is correct."
1975.74-884,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2203.136,2218.813,"But would a reasonable man have very much difficulty in concluding that this gun, this particular gun could be concealed under a heavy over coat?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2218.813,2221.887,I would say that the reasonable man—
1975.74-884,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.887,2227.077,"I am taking the extreme case, heavy over coat or very loose baggy pants?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2227.077,2233.491,"Well, I think the testimony was that that it could be concealed in an over coat as could a full size shotgun."
1975.74-884,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2233.491,2242.608,"From the Judge by submitting in the Jury obviously made the decision that a reasonable man could so conclude, did he not?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2242.608,2246.418,I believe that could be read into the Judge’s decision of submitting to a Jury.
1975.74-884,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.276,2264.071,But my question went to really telling us that a reasonable man could not reasonably conclude that this could be concealed in some way.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2264.071,2264.534,No.
1975.74-884,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2277.93,2285.742,"But he knew this was not a pistol and he knew it was not a revolver; therefore it was an other weapon, was it not?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2285.742,2290.456,"It may be, except I think at that point in determining the other firearms description—"
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.456,2293.465,(Inaudible) an other firearm.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2293.465,2298.034,It is another firearm but not all other firearms are within the prescription of the Statute.
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.064,2322.141,"That is statutory, not a constitutional."
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2322.141,2344.226,"That is correct and I think it is entwined with the argument that petition raises in terms of the constitutionality of the statute in terms of in determining its vagueness, I think that we need to look at the construction of the statute as one of the principles in determining whether or not it is certain and that it is certain as applied to sort-of shotguns."
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.187,2361.615,But the Ninth Circuit did not go on that ground.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2361.615,2366.006,"No, the Ninth Circuit did not in its opinion reach the construction argument."
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.22,2374.559,Is that not kind of strange that they did not reach the construction argument because they went right to the constitutional point?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2374.559,2396.283,"Well, I do not know if I would characterize this as strange, I may characterize it as unfortunate because I believe there is a construction argument there that probably under the leadership of this Court it has been clear in US versus Harris that if the statute can be construed in a constitutional manner, then it should be."
1975.74-884,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.398,2425.901,(Inaudible) right now they are just vacating the judgment below and sending it back to place the statutory question at the outset?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2425.901,2439.167,"Well, I think that I would object on the terms that it is not a clear question that the statute as applied is so certain that applies to sort-of shotguns."
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.666,2563.668,What is the use of sort-of shotguns?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2563.668,2566.161,Well I think that there are various reasons.
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.696,2575.678,"When you get out into the field, what use is made of it?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2575.678,2590.067,Well sort-of shotguns provide a less restrictive choke on the explosion of the pellets from the shotgun and gives it a wider stream.
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2590.067,2594.981,What do people use them for as a result of that less restricted choke?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2594.981,2599.516,"Well in terms of what people use them for, I do not know because I think that is a rather general question."
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2599.516,2601.281,They are used to shoot people with that.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2601.281,2601.981,What?
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.045,2605.928,Is it not the only use for it?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2605.928,2608.163,"I would not admit to that, no, that is –"
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.163,2610.055,You know any other use for?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2610.055,2612.736,I believe that you could use them in hunting birds for example and—
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2612.736,2621.488,But would you ever pick a shotgun with a ten inch barrel as opposed to a shotgun with a two and a half foot barrel to shoot birds with?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2621.488,2636.522,I think that you would have a considerable problem as Mr. Justice raises at great lengths but I am not willing to admit that that is the only purpose for the reducing the size if a barrel.
1975.74-884,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.522,2640.579,If you get the bird out at two feet from here you can use the sort-of shotgun.[Laughter]
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2640.579,2649.997,If the barrel is only sort of two inches or three inches then I think that your range is then proportioned to the reduction size of the barrel.
1975.74-884,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2649.997,2663.375,"Mr. Moberg, a couple of questions just leaving through the record, did Mrs. Powell persist in denying that she ever mailed this?"
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2663.375,2665.132,Yes she did.
1975.74-884,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2665.132,2674.835,And am I correct in my impression that she said she purchased it for her self-protection at home?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2674.835,2679.628,"She purchased a riffle, a shot gun for her protection."
1975.74-884,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2698.16,2704.926,Well then is it as to the other one that she conceded she never resembled?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2704.926,2720.414,"As to the sort-of shotgun, she testified that she never purchased the weapon that was subsequently reduced to a sort-of shotgun and that the only weapon that she purchased was in fact a full length shotgun which was in fact produced at trial."
1975.74-884,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2720.414,2726.287,Well is it not there is a testimony in her part that she put up in a closet and never assembled it?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2726.287,2727.764,That is correct.
1975.74-884,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2727.764,2733.956,And why would she not if purchased a shotgun for self protection?
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2733.956,2765.158,"Well I think at that point as I recall the evidence, her testimony was that she put it in there and she just simply – she was not familiar with weapons to start with and that she did not in fact know how to assemble or clean the weapon and she placed it then in the closet with the idea of then sometime putting it together and forgetting about it and it was not a long period of time between the purchase I think and the subsequent interrogation by the postal authority."
1975.74-884,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2765.158,2770.039,So she bought it for her protection but she did not do what was necessary for her protection.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2770.039,2773.055,That is correct from the record.
1975.74-884,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2778.158,2782.66,"This has something to do with the juries’ assessment of her credibility, I suppose."
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2782.66,2841.024,"Oh! Very much so and I guess that is not an issue that is before this Court or was before the Court Of Appeals in terms of her credibility and now one that I could properly raise because I believe that that is truly within the ambient of the jury to decide whether or not she in fact purchased a weapon but I think that the question it comes back to in terms of its interpretation, in terms of the statutes meaning, is the statute certain, does a statute number one give the no’s and does it too number one provide the protection against an arbitrary law enforcement and I think that that second part of this Connally test and the same test was raised in Lanzetta is even evident in this case because I think that at the point and I can always surmise the reasons that the prosecutor decide to prosecute under this seldom used statute, one it is to control mail order."
1975.74-884,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.158,2916.265,Let us just assume that someone disagrees with you and holds that the statute is perfectly clear insofar a sort-of shotgun and just as clear as it is with pistols.
1975.74-884,1,31828,jerry_j_moberg,,2938.895,2966.133,"I believe that his discretion is reduced except that the statute as written, I think in its entirety is the statute to control mail order shipment of pistols and revolvers and maybe mail order shipment of sort-of shotguns and that is not the purpose of the statute to prosecute an individual mailing of that kind of an item so that I do not think that at least practically that is a purpose or has been a use of the statute."
1975.74-884,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3395.346,3396.826,I have nothing further your Honor.
1975.74-884,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3396.826,3398.036,Thank you very much gentleman.
