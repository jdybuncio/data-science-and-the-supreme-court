1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,36.808,41.909,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,309.275,309.391,Well --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,309.391,309.635,They are --
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,309.635,314.882,-- are there any state-supported universities and colleges to which these regulations do not apply?
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,314.882,316.272,"Yes, Your Honor, there are."
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,319.618,321.868,"Well, let me put it another way."
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,331.955,339.277,"They apply to all schools and institutions within the University of Texas System, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.277,344.116,"Are those the ones that communities you mentioned, Galveston etcetera?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,344.116,346.304,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.304,348.769,And how many in all?
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,348.769,357.635,"(Voice Overlap) Oh, I think they -- they say they -- they have 17 component institutions in the system."
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.635,360.279,And they're all part of University of Texas System?
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,360.279,361.135,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,393.491,395.954,"And they are all the University of Texas, is that it?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,395.954,397.196,They're all the University of Texas System.
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,397.196,402.913,"And the other state supported colleges and universities are what, are they --"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,402.913,406.238,Some of them have their own individual boards of regents.
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,416.062,423.528,"What was the relationship of this other state university, the sate supported universities and colleges to the University of Texas System?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,423.528,428.895,None I think other than that they all got their money from the appropriation from the Texas legislature.
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,428.895,429.284,But there's no --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,429.284,429.953,They only states --
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,429.953,434.141,There's no common Board of Education for all of them?
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,434.141,439.258,"Not as far as regulating the hiring and firing, the day-to-day operation in the school, the rules and regulations."
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,439.258,441.155,But there is for all purposes.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,441.155,441.454,Pardon?
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.454,444.914,Is their overall agency as --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,444.914,446.996,To do -- to do -- that has this power?
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,446.996,451.213,That -- that super -- has something to do with every state supported colleges and universities.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,451.213,459.862,The Coordinating Board has to the extent it has power to -- to try to coordinate the degree programs.
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.472,497.947,How about Texas A&M?
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,497.947,512.744,"That's a matter of dispute, Mr. Justice Marshall.Our constitution said that Texas A&M is a branch of the University of Texas but it has operated under its own Board of Regents for many, many years."
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,528.39,534.572,"Well, is the Texas A&M separate and distinct from the University of Texas as of today?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,534.572,537.313,"It is as far as its operation is concerned, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,537.313,541.599,And yet it is not covered by this order.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,541.599,542.061,That's true.
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,543.636,547.518,"Well, then how can it be a statewide order?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,547.518,553.596,It applies to every institution under the control of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System.
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,553.596,562.312,The Board of Regents does not control all of the institutions of higher learning maintained by the State of Texas.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,562.312,562.738,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,564.537,568.073,"Well, don't you have to the other three-judge courts?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,568.073,569.816,"I -- I don't think so, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,578.419,586.817,"Well, suppose it controlled two schools, would it be a three-judge court matter?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,586.817,587.886,I think it would.
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,587.886,588.055,Well --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,588.055,588.231,I say it's not local.
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,588.231,598.876,"-- suppose it controlled two of the 300 schools maintained by the State of Texas, would you say that was statewide?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,598.876,599.513,Possibly not.
1971.70-55,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,600.515,605.447,"Well -- well, where is your line."
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,605.447,617.177,"Well, I dc/won't think we're called upon to draw the line in this case because we have gone so far the other side of the line, I think it's unquestioned whether we would draw at it at five, six, seven, or eight, I don't know."
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1093.302,1101.082,"Mr. Shultz, is -- is the New Left before us here -- the New Left Group?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1101.082,1104.032,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1104.032,1104.704,In what way?
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1109.725,1117.106,"They -- the New Left together with a group of individuals who were members of the New Left organization, there were some individuals six or eight --"
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1117.106,1117.238,They were --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1117.238,1117.295,-- individuals.
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1117.295,1119.767,-- all dismissed out.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1122.071,1133.264,We are -- we claim that they are here by virtual representation of the rest of their class that they left over in the federal court.
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1133.264,1137.061,Only -- only as a member of a class now.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1139.494,1141.548,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1141.548,1141.771,Maybe I --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1141.771,1141.895,But --
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1141.895,1148.115,-- should ask your opposing counsel as to their presence.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1148.115,1153.418,But there are contentions with regard to the relation between these two segments of the class.
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1194.059,1202.032,"Now, your opponent draws a distinction between a temporary injunction and a permanent one for res judicata purposes, would you comment on that?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1202.032,1203.821,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1328.27,1331.622,Is the temporary injunction on the state side appealable?
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1331.622,1334.504,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1334.504,1336.569,And it was never appealed as this in (Voice Overlap) --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1336.569,1337.504,It's still in effect.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.829,1347.164,"So there's no if -- in effect, there's no time limitation."
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1347.164,1348.092,"No, as far as they're -- they're remedy to that --"
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1348.092,1349.162,(Voice Overlap) --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1349.162,1351.043,They may have it -- try to have it set aside.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1351.139,1351.404,Yes.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1351.404,1356.759,-- it hasn't become irrevocably final in that respect.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1356.759,1360.463,"And they can move to have it set aside, and if that's denied, then they can appeal that denial."
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1360.463,1361.247,That's correct.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.352,1364.705,"But no -- no such efforts have been made, if understand?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1364.705,1366.472,"No, no."
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1380.963,1381.636,Yes.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1387.525,1387.785,No.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.93,1389.93,-- as you've already told us.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1390.304,1390.494,It's our --
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.494,1393.108,-- are the A -- A group and the B group and --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1393.108,1395.629,But it's our contention that their -- their part impartially of the same group.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1395.629,1396.713,"Well, I understand your contention."
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1396.713,1399.783,But the A group made the same contentions.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1406.252,1417.063,"The -- the Court says that it -- that it dismissed the -- the New Left Education Project, plaintiffs dismissed them as plaintiffs."
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1417.063,1417.628,"But here, in this Court --"
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1417.628,1420.534,So that there'd be no interference with the state judge of adjudication.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1420.534,1420.864,But if Your Honor will --
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1420.864,1427.689,"I'm reading from page 165 of the appendix which is the -- from now, I think the final memorandum opinion of the three-judge court."
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1427.689,1428.205,"Correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1484.411,1484.656,Or this has --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1484.656,1486.084,-- or to be no interference.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1501.554,1502.624,That's sort of a --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1502.624,1504.072,"So it's kind of -- within, within --"
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1504.072,1505.425,"Double talk, isn't it?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1505.425,1505.974,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1506.764,1508.266,They dismissed and then they save it.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1509.733,1516.039,We dismiss for one purpose but not for the other.
1971.70-55,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1523.571,1526.521,You have just about four and a half minutes left.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1526.521,1532.344,"Alright, Your Honor."
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1640.189,1651.652,"Mr. Shultz, do you understand that the appellees contend for the right to solicit in -- only in the free speech areas of the Austin campus or beyond that?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1651.652,1659.025,"Your Honor, there's only one free speech area at the Austin campus and that's -- it's a patio out for the union building, it's designated as such."
1971.70-55,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1669.041,1674.652,"Well, what is it you feel they're asking for to go everywhere and beyond the free speech area?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1674.652,1682.521,"Anywhere they want to go, that's what they've been doing, roaming free at will all over the campus, sat along with other people."
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1691.246,1700.198,"Is that -- is that all that's involved here, whether or not the university or the Regents may specify the places where these papers maybe sold?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1700.198,1701.408,From a vending machine.
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1701.598,1703.653,"No, I mean is that all that's been done?"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1708.58,1709.412,Solicitation of dues.
1971.70-55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1709.412,1710.699,Solicitation of what?
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1710.699,1711.177,Dues for --

1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1715.99,1716.498,"No, sir."
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.879,1733.48,Now --
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1733.48,1736.131,-- we wouldn't have much free access for everybody else.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1742.456,1749.592,"Well, according to -- according to your brother counsel on the other side, there is a good deal of activity there, balloons and --"
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1749.592,1751.723,"Your Honor, those are one -- one shot organization."
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.986,1755.279,Right.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1755.279,1759.554,-- some money for -- the other was to go to the East Austin --
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1759.554,1760.287,The poor people of East Austin.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1760.287,1761.166,-- poor people.

1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1773.686,1775.955,-- with that.
1971.70-55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.118,1777.758,That's why you made that concession in your brief.
1971.70-55,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1777.758,1778.307,Correct.

1971.70-55,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2755.574,2765.849,"Well, what do you say to Mr. Shultz's problem about they might violate the federal law then you might violate the state order, and who violates what?"
1971.70-55,1,21412,david_r_richards,,2765.849,2779.417,"Well, let me -- I'll come to that and try to speak to it, because I don't want to be caught up in the notion that we all were here together, the -- the people who were sent back to the state court in the Young Democrats and Young Socialists."
