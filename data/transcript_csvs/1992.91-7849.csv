1992.91-7849,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.338,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-7849, Stephen Buckley v. Michael Fitzsimmons."
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,57.479,61.303,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7849,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.802,147.408,"Mr. Taylor, does acceptance... would acceptance of your position require that we cut back at all on the opinion... on our decision in the Imbler case?"
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,147.408,148.457,No.
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.164,205.626,There was also no cause of action.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,210.448,219.664,"Not a cause of action, but in terms of the allegations here, in terms of false arrest, malicious prosecution, yes, there definitely were."
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.677,222.997,"Now, wait."
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,230.25,230.781,No.
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.359,249.144,"I'm saying that if you take them apart, there isn't any liability if... unless it leads up to the prosecution."
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,259.522,276.882,"--That's true in some ways, but on the other sense of it, the fact that the evidence was fabricated and then is introduced later time into this judicial process and causes injury should not be determinative of whether there's immunity because--"
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.882,280.175,Isn't it the introduction that causes the harm.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,285.197,304.93,"--That's where the harm... that's where the injury takes place, but that isn't the analysis that necessarily follows in terms of determining whether the function that the particular police officer or the function that the particular prosecutor did in order to lead you to that introduction."
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.166,367.422,"Well, don't we have to, first of all, decide whether you've stated a claim in order to address the immunity issue?"
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,367.422,369.313,"--Well, the Government--"
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.313,372.015,Isn't that part and parcel of the analysis?
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,372.015,374.937,"--Well, the Government raised that in its amicus for the first time."
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.546,422.939,"Well, I'm just asking you whether, as a matter of procedure, when a claim is made, whether the Court doesn't have to first decide whether a claim has actually been stated or not."
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,425.56,438.389,"--For qualified immunity, it becomes a much closer question as the Siegert case raises because to decide whether a claim is clearly established, you have to decide whether there's a claim in terms of a constitutional violation."
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,473.663,482.097,May I ask you whether the pretrial publicity issue was raised in the State criminal trial ever?
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,484.418,485.43,"Yes, it was."
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.273,493.545,And was that resolved against the defendant?
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,493.545,494.276,It's interesting.
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,503.73,505.342,But in this case it was decided against.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,505.342,505.823,--It was.
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.822,510.997,"Well, then is it res judicata under Allen against McCurdy?"
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,510.997,519.08,"--I don't believe so because the question here, we're dealing with both a substantive and a procedural due process violation."
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,552.313,559.796,"Well, to the extent that you're relying on procedural due process, are you... is that not barred at present?"
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,559.796,560.167,No.
1992.91-7849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.251,571.136,By the determination of the pretrial publicity claim made in... at the trial.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,571.136,585.274,"No, because the nature of what we're saying is that the process was infected by the publicity so that, therefore, the... what the... what he was deprived of, among other things, was an impartial decisionmaker."
1992.91-7849,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.274,589.857,Wasn't that precisely the issue that the judge determined against you in the criminal proceeding?
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,589.857,631.945,"Well, I... you know, not being totally familiar with the change of venue motion and the record on that, I can't say for sure, but if in fact the venue motion was denied, he himself... what we're saying is that the process including the judge was influenced by the prejudice and, therefore, both in the bond hearing and in the trial situation so that, therefore, the effect... and you have to take our allegations as true at this point that the publicity infected the process, so that I don't see how it could be res judicata in terms of whether it was a fair trial."
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.797,641.691,"Mr. Taylor, you're not entitled to process... to fair process and you're not entitled to a fair trial."
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,648.524,649.265,--True.
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.265,650.467,--or without due process.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,657.65,659.273,Well--
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.273,664.035,"And, therefore, you had not been deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process."
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,679.135,680.887,"--Well, that's--"
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.887,682.618,--on the basis of unfair process.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,682.618,692.753,"--That's true, and in this case, I mean, I want to make a distinction, as I did earlier, between the claims that underlie all but the publicity."
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.08,720.084,Separate from the trial you claim so that there's no absolute immunity.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,749.313,750.354,--No.
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.354,751.794,No claim at all.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,751.794,753.536,"Well, under those--"
1992.91-7849,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.536,755.056,He can fabricate as much evidence as he likes.
1992.91-7849,0,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,757.578,758.339,"--Well, at trial."
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1644.69,1651.414,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7849,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.839,1753.323,"Mr. Sotos, do you draw a distinction between, case one, the prosecutor fabricates evidence by filing the firing pin on the pistol and it gets... and then he introduces it; case two, it isn't the prosecutor that does it?"
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1757.946,1759.067,--If it was the prosecutor who did that?
1992.91-7849,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.067,1759.676,Right.
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1759.676,1760.557,"Yes, Justice."
1992.91-7849,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.557,1763.599,"Case two, it isn't the prosecutor that does it."
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1780.05,1781.891,The arresting officer would not be immune.
1992.91-7849,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.199,1812.341,"Well, but there are two acts."
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1824.287,1834.114,Because the prosecutor has to be protected from exposure to liability in that earlier act to the extent that he would be inhibited in terms of introducing that information into the process.
1992.91-7849,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1911.776,1927.675,"Mr. Sotos, what if what we have was the prosecutor manufacturing the evidence and obtaining an arrest warrant, the prosecution is later dismissed, but the defendant is arrested?"
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1930.926,1935.491,"Under Burns v. Reed, the prosecutor would only be entitled to qualified immunity under that scenario."
1992.91-7849,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1948.21,1957.454,--Is there any problem in this case because of a peculiarity of the Illinois laws where the indictment serves also as the arrest warrant?
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1957.454,1958.916,"Well, we believe--"
1992.91-7849,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.916,1960.208,What do we do about that?
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,1960.208,1965.98,--We believe that's the reason that the petitioner's false arrest claim should not be permitted to circumvent absolute immunity.
1992.91-7849,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.524,2015.503,"Suppose that in the case of manufactured evidence an indictment is secured... or fabricated evidence, and the prosecutor, knowing the evidence is fabricated, then announces to the public how strong the evidence is."
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2020.897,2029.753,"Under those circumstances, Your Honor, that would be a claim where the petitioner was claiming a deprivation of liberty attributable to a prosecutor's participation in an administrative act."
1992.91-7849,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2035.407,2043.251,--There's only qualified immunity if the prosecutor gives a press conference outlining the evidence after there's an indictment?
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2043.251,2045.682,That's correct.
1992.91-7849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.922,2093.121,"Well, what's... why is this press conference... why is it... why is the conduct in holding... why is the prosecutor absolutely immune in this case for the press conference?"
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2093.121,2103.491,"Because to properly apply the functional approach, Justice White, the Court should focus on the entire claim, not just the act because, again, that runs the risk of Imbler being a pleading rule."
1992.91-7849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.698,2177.639,"Well, what if he sued the prosecutor for libel?"
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2177.639,2183.753,--That would be a claim that would not circumvent the problems he would have with Paul v. Davis.
1992.91-7849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.753,2185.093,"So, it would be just qualified immunity."
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2185.093,2189.417,"To the extent that it was an immunity analysis, it would just be qualified immunity."
1992.91-7849,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.083,2264.634,Is that a fair summary of the press conference?
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2270.979,2272.98,--That is the claim.
1992.91-7849,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.98,2274.762,"So, it isn't just his opposing the motion."
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2276.493,2279.485,"But again, Your Honor, that would only be half of the analysis."
1992.91-7849,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2337.094,2340.415,Do you support the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit?
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2340.415,2344.067,"We do support the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit, Justice Kennedy."
1992.91-7849,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.533,2368.113,May I just be sure I understand one other point?
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2376.15,2388.375,"Yes, Justice Stevens, we would because under that scenario the chief doesn't have a later... he doesn't have... by statute he doesn't have the responsibility to determine whether to prosecute or whether to present the State's case."
1992.91-7849,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.375,2407.64,"No, but I would think in terms of what the prosecutor decides later, I assume probably that the police chief would be indemnified by the county and he'd also... to the extent your argument is valid, it seems to me it would influence his prosecutorial decision in the same way because the damage liability... technically it's against one officer rather than the other, but I guess his real client would pay the bill in either event."
1992.91-7849,1,32862,james_g_sotos,,2407.64,2410.342,That the chief's exposure would influence the prosecutor's--
1992.91-7849,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2569.755,2583.446,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7849,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.535,2726.698,"Now, was this point raised by the respondents in the lower courts?"
1992.91-7849,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2726.698,2740.827,"--I don't know if it was raised specifically by the respondents in the lower courts, but the courts below both said that it is a necessary consideration whether there is an actionable harm, that that is a subsidiary issue in determining the question of immunity."
1992.91-7849,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.458,2744.189,"So, you say the lower courts have passed on this question?"
1992.91-7849,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2744.189,2753.926,"--They passed on it, and I would point to pages 89 and 90 of the court... first court of appeals opinion, pages 105, 106, and 108 of the joint appendix."
1992.91-7849,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.926,2758.087,Did the respondent rely on it in its brief... his brief here?
1992.91-7849,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2758.087,2763.473,"I don't believe that he relied on it specifically, but again, I think it's a matter of characterization of the argument here."
1992.91-7849,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2795.913,2805.839,"Do you agree with Mr. Sotos' conclusion that there would be only qualified immunity if, say, the person lost his job and that was the injury from the fabricated evidence?"
1992.91-7849,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2819.68,2820.181,I think that--
1992.91-7849,3,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,3027.737,3063.591,"When the question of two prosecutors, or police doing the act rather than the prosecutor, comes up in both of the contexts of both the manufacture of the evidence, the interrogation of the witnesses, and the prejudicial publicity, we see the basic fallacy of their argument because what they're doing here and what the court of appeals is doing is... has a premise and a principle which extends prosecutorial immunity to all those kinds of actions."
1992.91-7849,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.958,3172.662,"Mr. Taylor, I thought that the concession of qualified immunity liability with respect to the press conference was a concession of qualified immunity as to injuries other than the injuries that are produced through the trial, that is, qualified immunity for any libel."
1992.91-7849,3,26190,george_f_taylor_jr,,3172.662,3176.553,That's not the way they stated it in the brief.
1992.91-7849,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3255.817,3257.189,"Thank you, Mr. Taylor."
