1966.615,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.807,"Number 615, Ralph Berger against the people for the State of New York."
1966.615,0,28928,joseph_e_brill,,30.779,35.47,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,2726.617,2729.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2821.341,2828.842,"Well, doesn't the privilege against self-incrimination cut across your argument with respect to this minifon?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,2828.842,2836.989,I -- It is -- it is our contention -- it is our contention that this is not a means for compelling self-incriminatory statements.
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2836.989,2841.612,"Well, as if you say its like a search warrant, it is?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,2841.612,2847.571,A search warrant in our view is not a compulsory document in the same sense as a subpoena either.
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2907.957,2911.158,"I see, your reliance is on Schmerber?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,2911.158,2916.827,"Well, I think that Schmerber is -- is enlightening in this regard, Justice Fortas."
1966.615,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2972.354,2976.602,Did you have challenge to Boyd or the concurring opinion of the majority?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,2976.602,2997.078,"The majority opinion; I -- I see Boyd and this is really essential to my argument, Justice Black, I see Boyd for all that it does express some very important principles which have contributed to the growth of civil liberties in this country and I can well understand how such a man as Justice Brandeis would have appraised it as highly as he did."
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3038.521,3045.952,"Well, that certainly is not the history of the Fifth Amendment of the privilege against self-incrimination?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3045.952,3046.826,The Fifth Amendment is for --
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3046.826,3054.249,That's been -- that's been an accuracy of testimonial privilege of saying its --
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3054.249,3063.648,"The Fifth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment in Boyd and the similar privilege as mentioned in Entick, it seems to me was brought in almost by the way."
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3073.757,3087.991,"But how are you helped if you -- you are -- if there is a wall erected between the Fourth and the Fifth Amendment, but nevertheless this is a Fifth Amendment violation here?"
1966.615,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3099.99,3100.552,"Oh, yes."
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3100.552,3109.029,The words that were garnered by this surreptitious trespass were incriminatory.
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3113.881,3114.143,I don't -- I don't want to --
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3114.143,3118.661,"Now, that raises the Fifth Amendment problem, how are you helped?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3118.661,3123.998,"Mr. Justice, every piece of evidence that is obtained is incriminatory."
1966.615,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3130.556,3137.976,"In the Miranda case, he was talking in the cell in the precinct -- in his precinct, he wasn't really tortured."
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3147.216,3161.083,"And he at least knew that he was talking to the police agents, but here you have a man talking without knowing that he's talking to police agents --"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3161.083,3161.279,I have --
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3161.279,3171.007,"And it would be putting hard I should think to say that this was a voluntary like on the part of Mr. Berger, wouldn't it?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3171.007,3181.084,Justice Fortas the Court found no difficulty in saying that there was no compulsion in Osborn and in Hoffa despite the fact that that very situation pertained there.
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3186.503,3190.015,"Well, it's quite a different kind of problem?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3190.015,3191.004,"Why -- well, but is it as far as compulsion --"
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3191.004,3192.333,There's no Pardon at this stage --
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3192.333,3193.513,I beg your pardon sir?
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3193.513,3195.01,"No pardon, -- no Mr. Pardon --"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3195.01,3197.545,No Mr. Pardon no Mr. Vic in this case.
1966.615,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3257.159,3271.45,"Of course, the seizure of a letter by a subpoena or the seizure of a letter by a warrant doesn't have in it the element of voluntariness that we normally associate it with?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3271.45,3272.352,Well Justice Douglas I --
1966.615,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3272.352,3272.527,Go ahead
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3272.527,3274.773,– would make a distinction between subpoena and warrant.
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3302.723,3313.007,What happens to him if he refuses to submit to the search and it's -- but it's a lawful warrant?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3319.128,3324.841,"No, I would assume the police would take such measures and it's necessary to carry out the order of the Court."
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3324.976,3331.764,And you would say that's not coercive that that doesn't involve any element of coercion?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3331.764,3332.177,Correct.
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3336.932,3346.06,"It just says that you have a choice between making yourself incriminatory statements or going to jail, that's all?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3346.06,3346.713,"That's correct, sir."
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3383.081,3389.865,"The problem is -- the problem is to whether -- the problem is whether the compelled action, the two -- two questions."
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3441.092,3446.304,"Justice Fortas, there maybe misunderstanding here but I read the implication of what you said to me."
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3456.334,3460.028,"Oh, you've quite misunderstand me, of course you do."
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3494.276,3500.51,"Well perhaps if I may, Justice Fortas, I'd like to address myself to the use of the word trespass."
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3536.594,3537.882,May I ask you with this.
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3548.091,3549.764,Any device I'm quite sure of.
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3549.764,3560.271,"Now suppose -- suppose we had everything except the -- here we got the Court order, you'd still say, “Silverman is not trespassory?”"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3560.271,3560.348,Well --
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3560.348,3561.336,If you had the Court order?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3561.336,3568.195,"Well, positively because once the Court order -- order autho -- specifically authorizes the intrusion and it seems to me that can be no longer --"
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3568.195,3581.866,"Even though in fact -- well, I mean you say the order for, I had trouble, I must say, seeing whether there's anything in this order which says to a policeman you can drive a spike mic into Mr. Neyer's office wall."
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3586.586,3598.34,Yes sir and I -- and I certainly cannot point any language in the order that specifically authorizes them the means of placing the instrument within the order -- the order in point of fact takes the act.
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3598.34,3600.047,Why don't we know how the police did this?
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3602.057,3609.532,Aren't you quite willing to assume that the police -- that the police did something here which without the order would be trespass?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3609.532,3611.815,Without the order it could be -- it would be a crime.
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3611.815,3612.324,Alright.
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3619.371,3621.899,There is the -- there will be the crime of eavesdropping.
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3623.148,3625.994,"Getting -- in getting -- now, just getting into the place --"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3625.994,3626.258,Yes.
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3626.258,3632.112,– just getting into the place that they must have got a key or they broke the door down or something to take it --
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3632.112,3636.226,"Well, they didn't break the door down because they didn't want to leave any traces of having been there."
1966.615,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3646.122,3651.12,Well as I read the --
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3651.12,3654.564,A legalized burglary is that –
1966.615,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3654.564,3663.591,"As I read these cases from the 18th Century -- in the 18th Century, they were -- they were tested by usage of a trespass action."
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3663.591,3663.938,"Yes, sir."
1966.615,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3663.938,3665.235,"There was John Wilkes, wasn't it?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3667.245,3671.747,"Yes -- well, Entick was a -- yes, I guess it was."
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3671.747,3672.574,Trespass action --
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3672.574,3673.162,Yes.
1966.615,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3673.263,3676.309,So this would be a trespass but for this warrant?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3676.309,3678.347,It certainly would be a trespass but for the warrant.
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3700.935,3709.065,"And I take that this could have happened in my house if I lived in New York, maybe I'm glad that I don't [Laughter] but is that right?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3709.065,3714.877,The limitations are I am suggesting Justice Brennan are the Fourth Amendment limitations which to me --
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3714.877,3720.32,No but could it happen -- could they -- could one of these orders authorize the same thing in my home?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3720.32,3720.72,Could it?
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3784.186,3799.325,"But isn't that really the difference between the Osborn situation and this, that is to say in Osborn, there's the chance anyway that the conversation would be -- that was reported would be pinpointed and --"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3799.325,3800.006,Would be --
1966.615,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3800.006,3830.485,Would be pinpointed and related to the subject as to which there was presumably a showing of probable cause and that's the difference between minifon in the Osborn situation and this sort of a universal recording of whatever goes on and including I assume many things that had no relationship or whatever to the showing of probable cause?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3830.485,3839.477,"I don't see that that is a significant distinction in the sense that, a man who goes in with the minifon face the facts, may also record other things."
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3915.24,3922.359,And even if what -- what to get in the way of conversation proves an entirely different crime from that -- for which you got the authorization?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3922.359,3925.457,"Well, that then I think Justice Brennan is another question."
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3955.142,3960.416,"Well, I just wonder in this case, suppose they turned up some conversation of confession to a murder?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3960.416,3961.912,That's another case.
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3961.996,3963.742,"It would be another case, what would New York do about it?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3963.742,3966.535,"Well, New York is already acting on that in this other case."
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3966.535,3967.53,And prosecute it?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,3967.53,3989.24,"People against Gandiffier and Grossman, the trial court reversed on that ground among the others and it was reversed by the appellant division and the conviction was sustained on the grounds that the order being legal initially what was perceived during the course of it relating to the commission of another crime did not have to be disregarded by the police."
1966.615,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3997.658,3999.181,"Harris, Harris."
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4001.92,4002.466,It does --
1966.615,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4002.466,4010.835,"They were looking for two cancel $10,000.00 checks as I remember and they found some false selective service."
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4010.835,4011.828,"Yes, selective service."
1966.615,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4011.978,4012.923,Forged selective service
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4012.923,4018.509,And the conviction was upheld and that case conflicts I think with Maryland.
1966.615,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4018.629,4018.861,Yeah.
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4020.282,4021.411,Yes.
1966.615,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4021.82,4022.906,Books and record.
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4022.906,4029.293,As there -- I suggest that the Harris rule is the sound of one as far as this is concerned.
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4060.08,4067.212,Do you think this is really -- you can go ahead but that -- what -- is there really anything seized at all?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4067.212,4068.105,Is anything seized?
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4071.529,4076.42,What is it -- what if the police -- what if the warrant authorized the policeman to hide in the closet?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4081.181,4081.742,"Yes, sir."
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4098.286,4100.712,"Well, does it make any difference -- does it make any difference though?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4105.872,4110.617,If there wasn't any seizure then you either have nothing or a crime.
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4113.888,4114.575,Why?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4114.575,4116.863,Because nothing has been offered in any trial.
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4116.863,4123.816,"Oh, I know but there's no -- it doesn't mean that – that's what I say you still have the same thing left even if you say there isn't anything -- there isn't any seizure."
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4129.776,4133.094,"If it comes under the Fourth Amendment, it does -- I've -- in conventional --"
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4133.094,4146.281,It doesn't have to be a seizure to file in the -- to violate the Fourth Amendment and there could be a search that but no seizure or whatsoever that violates the Fourth Amendment.
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4146.281,4157.099,"I think Your Honor is referring to those cases, in which there was no physical possession obtained in the article, but there was subsequent testimony in Court relating to the article that was seen."
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4165.687,4172.122,"Well, I just don't -- this doesn't appear to me that it makes much difference when you call a seizure, not as you saw this thing problem that --"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4172.122,4172.881,"Well, alright."
1966.615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4173.151,4174.481,-- it is not about seizure then?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4174.481,4177.915,Perhaps it's a -- it's a semantic problem only.
1966.615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4191.495,4193.97,That is to include of an illegal search or something like that?
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4193.97,4194.942,It's something of that sort.
1966.615,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4206.316,4206.872,Excuse me.
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4206.872,4207.121,"Yes, sir."
1966.615,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4207.121,4217.572,"Did I understand you to say that, you do not think the Fourth Amendment prohibits a search or seizure, but only a search and seizure?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4217.572,4219.407,"Well, insofar as the exclusionary rule --"
1966.615,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4219.407,4221.647,I'm not talking about the exclusionary rule.
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4237.975,4247.0,"It's difficult -- I would -- I would suppose the same, but it's difficult to see what the enforcement for an unlawful search without a seizure could be --"
1966.615,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4247.0,4248.83,"Could be crucial, isn't it?"
1966.615,1,40655,richard_uviller,,4248.83,4249.576,But well -- yes.

1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6581.769,6584.936,"By making a motion to suppress, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1966.615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6584.936,6587.019,"Do you have to take the initiative, is that it?"
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6587.019,6589.064,Exactly so.
1966.615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6648.369,6658.339,"Well, did the -- did the prosecution after you filed the motion just what would say, that's right there it is or you have to get a judge to tell him co-partner if you get something?"
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6658.339,6667.648,"I regret to say Mr. Justice Brennan that the prosecution gave me, no information beyond what I already had and they didn't give me that."

1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6708.724,6708.97,No.
1966.615,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6721.415,6725.029,"Well, then happen -- what appears in the record on page 22?"
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6725.029,6726.929,That Mr. Justice Stewart is the preliminary --

1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6727.659,6748.612,"-- is the preliminary in connection with the proceedings that were to be held on the renewal of the motion to suppress and that is the area, and to which Mr. Uviller refers when he says the record is cloudy as to what was before the issuing judge at the time the warrants were issued."
1966.615,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6771.248,6771.485,Yes.
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6780.0,6782.353,What McKenzie said at that time Mr. Justice Stewart --
1966.615,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6782.353,6789.116,The people now state that we intend to introduce evidence in the course of the trial which has been obtained over an eavesdropping device.
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6793.36,6803.821,That came after I renewed the motion to suppress as I had leave to do pursuant to the order of the court which denied my motion originally.
1966.615,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6803.821,6804.131,Why?
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6812.03,6822.556,I think that the respondents' brief reflects the number of eavesdropping orders which it obtained over period of some six years.
1966.615,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6836.283,6841.202,I wondered where are those statistics could come from if all the --
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6841.202,6844.268,That would have to come internally from the prosecutor's office.

1966.615,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6858.821,6865.3,Uh-hmm.
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6865.3,6868.918,I think they are at page 61 Mr. Uviller advices me.
1966.615,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6868.918,6870.861,Thank you.
1966.615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6870.861,6895.71,"Mr. Brill, may I ask, am I correct in thinking that none of your Fourth Amendment argument rests on any construction of the Fourth Amendment, the Warrant Clause, as required to the clause itself, the service of a warrant?"
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6895.71,6897.95,That is right sir.
1966.615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6897.95,6900.007,You do not make that argument?
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6900.007,6901.942,"No, I -- we point out of course --"
1966.615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6901.942,6902.763,I know that it does.
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6916.922,6920.972,That's right Mr. Justice Brennan.
1966.615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6941.388,6942.793,"Well, that's what I was trying to get at."
1966.615,2,28928,joseph_e_brill,,6958.697,6958.967,No.
1966.615,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7096.02,7098.462,Very well.
