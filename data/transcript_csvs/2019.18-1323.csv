2019.18-1323,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.6,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-1323, June Medical Services versus Russo, and the cross-petition, 18-1460, Russo versus June Medical Services. Ms. Rikelman."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,13.6,20.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about respect for the Court's precedent."
2019.18-1323,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,146.0,154.08,Would you have done anything different if it had been -- if the third-party standing had been timely raised?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,154.08,182.84,"Your Honor, we certainly could have submitted additional evidence in the court, but we believe that the evidence that is already there is sufficient to find third-party standing. This Court has squarely found third-party standing in at least four abortion cases that are on point, as well as a number of other cases such as Meyer, Craig, Carey, and the Court's cases have been consistent in saying that a plaintiff who is directly regulated by a law has third-party standing."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,182.84,203.16,"Would you agree with the general proposition that a party should not be able to sue ostensibly to protect the rights of other people, if there is a real conflict of interest between the party who is suing and those whose rights the party claims to be attempting to defend?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,203.16,207.24,"No, Your Honor, not if that party is directly regulated by the law in question."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,217.28,218.4,Really? That's amazing.
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,232.8,235.96,If the plaintiff is directly regulated by the law.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,242.88,277.16,"Well, that's amazing. Let's -- I mean -- I -- I -- suppose -- I know you think that the admitting privileges requirement serves no safety purpose, but suppose that the regulation that was being challenged was one that a lot of people might think really did serve a safety purpose. Let's say we're in a state where physicians' assistants can perform abortions, and a -- an abortion clinic wants to challenge the training requirements for physicians' assistants."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,293.72,307.8,"This Court has squarely held in many cases that a plaintiff directly regulated by the law can sue, and those cases make sense for at least two reasons, Your Honor. First, because a plaintiff should not be subject to severe penalties under an unconstitutional rule."
2019.18-1323,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.76,314.44,And that --
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,314.44,315.44,And that's clearly true --
2019.18-1323,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.44,321.36,"That sounds -- that sounds like a direct standing, not third-party standing."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,330.24,346.48,"No, Your Honor, there is not even a plausible conflict in this case because this Court already held that admitting privileges served no medical benefit, and the district court here, after a trial, specifically found that this law would serve no benefit and, in fact, would harm the health of women in Louisiana."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,346.48,356.12,"But, you know, your argument is using the merits to defeat -- to -- to support standing."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,358.16,358.8,"No, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,385.4,386.24,Counsel --
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,386.24,386.92,That --
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,386.92,401.88,"-- is this -- I -- I'm just wondering, are these doctors in any different position than potential plaintiffs, women, who feel burdened by this law?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,401.88,403.2,"No, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,425.88,430.72,So the point is you have standing on behalf of those women who feel burdened?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,430.72,431.36,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,431.36,444.28,"To the extent that other women may not have brought a suit, that's irrelevant to the fact that there are some, those burdened, who could have and would have, if situations had permitted them to?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,444.28,445.4,That's absolutely right --
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,445.4,445.84,"Well, then --"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,445.84,446.24,-- Your Honor.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,446.24,449.16,-- why can't -- why shouldn't they be the ones to bring suit?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,449.16,455.6,"Your Honor, this is a law that restricts abortion by regulating the physicians, rather than their patients."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,458.52,459.04,"Well, but --"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,459.04,460.04,-- state has pointed to --
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,460.04,466.4,"-- the -- the constitutional right at issue is not a constitutional right of abortion clinics, is it? It's a right of women."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,466.4,472.84,"That's correct, Your Honor, but in order for women to access their right to abortion, they need to be able to access those services."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,472.84,484.68,Do -- do you think a party can have third-party -- there can be third-party standing if there is no hindrance whatsoever to the bringing of suit by the people whose rights are at stake?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,484.68,490.4,This Court has allowed third-party standing in cases where the law directly regulates the plaintiff without a showing of hindrance.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,501.92,504.12,"Well, I think that's highly debatable that they waived it."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,511.24,528.72,"Your Honor at JA 45, the state explicitly conceded third-party standing and urged the district court to reach the undue burden claim, saying that it had a keen interest in removing any cloud upon the validity of its law, that this case was the proper vehicle for doing so."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,528.72,542.72,"It's a -- it's a highly debatable interpretation of that passage, which I've read numerous times. What the state was saying was that the -- while the temp -- if a temporary restraining order was issued, the lawsuit should continue to go forward."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,563.48,566.6,"Your Honor, at JA 45 there was a deliberate waiver."
2019.18-1323,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,590.16,594.32,It wasn't raised in -- in the district court or in the court of appeals.
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,603.2,604.84,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,604.84,613.8,"And might you have, if you had a timely notice, just as insurance, joined a patient or two?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,613.8,615.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.08,660.64,"How many abortion cases has -- has the Court either expressly or silently allowed the doctors to sue on behalf of the women? I -- I counted eight, but maybe that's overstating it. How many abortion cases in this Court?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,660.64,661.72,"At least eight, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,667.32,673.4,"So if we didn't in this case, it would require either directly or indirectly overruling eight cases of this Court?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,673.4,674.12,That's correct.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,690.64,695.52,In how many of those cases did the Court discuss the issue of conflict of interest?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,695.52,699.76,The Court in Danforth specifically said that the plaintiffs had standing.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,705.4,705.72,Was it --
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,705.72,706.56,-- because the state --
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,706.56,707.96,Was it a footnote in Danforth?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,707.96,709.12,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,713.08,713.36,"Yeah, but --"
2019.18-1323,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,713.36,723.32,"You made a point about Craig against Boren, that the ostensible purpose of the law was to save the vulnerable young men from the evils of 3.2 beer?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,723.32,728.56,"That's correct, Your Honor, and the Court allowed the saloon keeper to bring the third-party standing claim."
2019.18-1323,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,752.96,760.16,"Counsel, do you agree that the inquiry under Hellerstedt is a factual one that has to proceed state-by-state?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,760.16,768.92,"Your Honor, I think that facts may vary, but what we know is that the district court held a trial here and found that there were no material differences between this case and --"
2019.18-1323,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,768.92,790.16,"No, no, I know, but if -- if the issue, the statutes are on the books in other states, and if the issues are raised there, is the same inquiry required in each case? You have to have the district court examine the availability of specific clinics and the admitting privileges of doctors so that the litigation could be -- the results could be different in different states?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,790.16,792.0,"Two points, if I may, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,816.8,846.32,"If a -- if a state passed an admitting privileges law therefor, and suppose a state had ten clinics and two doctors for each clinic, but all 20 doctors could easily get the admitting privileges, so that there'd be no effect on the clinics, no effect on the doctors who perform abortions, and, therefore, no effect on the women who obtain abortions, would a law be constitutional in that state?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,846.32,855.92,"That law may still be unconstitutional if it's restricting access because of the 30-mile limit, Your Honor, but that's very different from the situation here where the district court concluded --"
2019.18-1323,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,855.92,872.72,"If it didn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- if it didn't, though, put aside the 30-mile, assume all the doctors who currently perform abortions can obtain admitting privileges, could you say that the law still imposes an undue burden, even if there were no effect?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,872.72,889.24,"That law would have no benefit, Your Honor, and it may pose a much harder question than this case. But in this case the district court after a trial explicitly found that the burdens of this law would be severe, and it would leave only one physician to serve 10,000 people per year in the entire state."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,889.56,895.32,"Well, the Fifth Circuit went through what the district court had said about the various doctors."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,903.28,904.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,909.8,911.0,"Well, let's take one example."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,915.92,916.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,916.76,928.48,"So he had -- he didn't have -- it would be counter to his own interests for him to make a super effort to get admitting privileges, wouldn't it, because he'd be defeating his own claim?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,928.48,929.76,"No, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,938.36,938.8,All right.
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,951.08,951.64,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,951.64,954.36,A predecessor of Christus Schumpert?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,954.36,955.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,955.76,962.08,He testified that he didn't apply for admitting privileges there because it's a Catholic hospital; isn't that right?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,962.08,963.68,That was part of the testimony.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,969.48,970.68,All right.
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,976.16,977.36,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,977.36,979.2,All right.
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,982.16,982.92,Yes.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,982.92,985.32,Doe Number 3 has admitting privileges there?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,985.32,992.32,He has admitting privileges that require 50 admissions per year which he is able to satisfy because he has an obstetrics practice.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1010.68,1011.56,When Doe --
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1011.56,1012.56,-- including residency.
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1012.56,1021.04,"-- Number 2 explained why he didn't apply to this hospital, he said, in part, because it's not a place where I would feel comfortable."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1022.0,1028.24,"He did, Your Honor. Doe 2 focused his efforts on hospitals where he thought he had the best chance of obtaining privileges."
2019.18-1323,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1032.64,1035.16,Did the district court mention any of these facts?
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1035.16,1036.4,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1062.76,1066.04,Footnote: That's Doctor Number 6.
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1066.04,1068.52,"All of these physicians are outpatient physicians, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1069.16,1071.44,"No, but Number 6 is only a medical doctor."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1071.44,1072.4,That's correct.
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1072.4,1077.96,He hasn't done any surgical procedures since 2004 and 2005.
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1077.96,1078.64,That's correct.
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1127.92,1139.2,"Can we go to Doe 3, the doctor who had the active OB-GYN practice? He's only a part-time doctor in Hope."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1139.2,1140.24,That's correct.
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1140.24,1177.24,"There's been much talk about his statement or findings by the district court that he was a superseding cause to the Act because he, on his own, will not practice in that -- in Hope if this law goes into effect because he would be the only doctor. But putting that aside, he also testified -- I'm sorry -- the Hope manager testified that he only does a limited number of abortions, and without the other doctor, that clinic would have to close."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1177.24,1178.96,"That's absolutely right, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1210.96,1211.24,Could I --
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1211.24,1213.16,There's no dispute here about Doe 1.
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1213.16,1214.56,That's correct.
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1214.56,1217.6,"The other side, that finding it says it's right."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1224.72,1225.6,Correct.
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1225.6,1228.2,"So, at least with respect to that."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1252.36,1252.96,That's correct.
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1252.96,1253.36,All right.
2019.18-1323,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1253.36,1277.28,"Can I follow up on the Chief Justice's earlier question and mine as well? Are you saying that admitting privileges laws are always unconstitutional, such that we don't have to look at the facts in -- state by state? Or are you saying that actually you do look at the facts state by state, and in some states, admitting privileges laws could be constitutional, if they impose no burdens?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1277.28,1288.0,"Your Honor, the burdens may vary, but a law that has no benefit and serves no valid state interest, which is what this Court held in Whole Woman's Health, is much more likely to be an undue burden."
2019.18-1323,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1288.0,1293.6,"Could an admitting privileges law of this kind ever have a valid purpose, in your view?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1293.6,1294.92,"No, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1298.24,1303.04,"So your view is that they're unconstitutional in any state, regardless of the facts?"
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1303.04,1305.2,They certainly serve no valid state interest.
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1314.32,1315.0,Would this be --
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1315.0,1316.48,-- in Louisiana.
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1316.48,1332.12,"-- different if -- if they did something as limited as, for example, you have to be admitted somewhere, because some -- being admitted somewhere does further credentialing benefits? But this was you have to be admitted within 30 miles."
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1337.52,1338.76,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-1323,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1358.32,1358.48,How many --
2019.18-1323,0,63232,julie_rikelman,,1358.48,1358.84,-- in Baton Rouge.

Louisiana's decision to require abortion providers to have admitting privileges was justified by abundant evidence of life-threatening health and safety violations, malpractice, noncompliance with professional licensing rules, legislative testimony from post-abortive women, testimony from doctors who took care of abortion providers' abandoned patients. The substantive due process claim that plaintiffs assert on their patients' behalf hinged upon their assertion that they would not be able to get privileges, but they can and they did."

There's one finding in that respect, and you can tell me if there's any dispute about it, but this circuit didn't seem to contest this finding of the district court, that a hospital transfer was required far less than once a year or less than one per several thousand patients.

2019.18-1323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2764.96,2783.16,"But the standing -- the Court went on to the merits solely on the basis of the beer seller's standing, and you've got a state regulation that is -- ostensibly was designed to protect these vulnerable boys from drinking beer and getting into accidents."
2019.18-1323,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2783.16,2783.76,May I?
2019.18-1323,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2783.76,2784.56,It's a dangerous --
2019.18-1323,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2784.56,2786.0,"Very -- very, very briefly, counsel."
2019.18-1323,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2786.0,2795.28,"Justice Ginsburg, my -- my answer to that is that the -- the buyer in that case was much more just -- it was much more just a financial transaction."
2019.18-1323,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2802.56,2803.08,Thank you.
2019.18-1323,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2803.08,2806.6,-- really wasn't a health --
2019.18-1323,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2806.6,2814.08,"Thank you, counsel. General Wall."
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2814.08,2839.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners' counsel began this morning by saying that this case is about respect for the Court's precedents, but she went on to acknowledge two rather remarkable propositions that flow from the logic of Petitioners' position and that are nowhere to be found in the Court's cases. To you, Justice Alito, that the plaintiffs may bring this suit even if there is a potential or actual conflict of interest with Louisiana women."
2019.18-1323,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2879.4,2880.6,But what sense --
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2880.6,2882.28,-- review their fairly modest efforts.
2019.18-1323,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2882.28,2896.24,"What sense does this 30-mile -- that's what I don't understand. I think everybody also agrees that the most likely place the woman will be if she needs to be in a hospital, she'll be at home."
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2902.6,2904.76,"So two points, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.18-1323,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2937.2,2937.44,But it just --
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2937.44,2937.96,-- that the doctors --
2019.18-1323,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2937.96,2944.6,-- it just supposed starting out from the clinic where she won't be. She's not going to be at the clinic.
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2944.6,2971.12,"Well, that's often true, Justice Ginsburg, but the record here, unlike in Hellerstedt, reveals that sometimes it's not true, that sometimes women develop complications in the clinic and, in fact, Doe 3, who I think on this record is probably the most competent of the Does and is the medical director at Hope, said that he has on occasion had a patient who develops a problem like a perforated uterus and admitted into the hospital and treated it. So even Doe 3 thinks of that as a best medical practice."
2019.18-1323,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2982.52,2982.76,But it would --
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2982.76,2983.36,And Louisiana --
2019.18-1323,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2983.36,2989.48,It would never happen to the -- when you go to the clinic just to take two pills and go home.
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2989.48,3004.36,"Well, if you develop a complication at home, it's not -- the -- it's not clear that you won't call the clinic and say to your doctor I'm having a problem, and your doctor will say then go to the following hospital where I have privileges, I'll meet you there. Now, that's not to say as a patient that's necessarily what you would want."
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3009.76,3010.16,Mr. Wall --
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3010.16,3011.24,-- they saw at the clinic.
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3011.24,3020.48,-- are you taking the position that there is no woman in Louisiana who doesn't feel burdened by this law?
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3020.48,3022.28,I -- I'm taking the position that --
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3022.28,3022.72,"No, no."
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3023.56,3023.72,Well --
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3023.72,3028.96,Is there at least one potential woman you believe that could bring this lawsuit?
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3028.96,3030.2,I assume that there are --
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3030.2,3030.92,All right.
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3031.08,3031.8,-- but they have not sued --
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3031.8,3048.44,"-- stop a moment. Assuming -- we assume, because it's logical, okay, the woman who lives 300 -- there is going to be some woman who lives 330 miles away, who's going to say that's an unusually long period of time for me to have to drive and then drive back the same day."
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3108.6,3112.92,"Well, I would say two things, Justice Sotomayor: Their interests are not necessarily aligned."
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3123.48,3123.6,"Well, please tell me --"
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3123.6,3123.92,-- how they would have --
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3123.92,3124.48,-- what you imagine.
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3124.48,3125.44,But to give you a couple of examples --
2019.18-1323,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3125.44,3125.68,Okay.
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3125.68,3129.28,-- just to give you -- it's not clear to me that women would have brought facial challenge.
2019.18-1323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3131.4,3134.36,"How do you deal with this? I mean, I -- I have read the briefs."
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3199.2,3203.12,"I -- I don't want to go back to 1789, Justice Breyer, but I -- I do --"
2019.18-1323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3203.12,3204.8,You want to go back for 40 years?
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3204.8,3222.64,"Well, I think what we want to say is that in none of those cases has the Court ever considered and -- and signed off in the face of a potential or actual conflict of interest. So, yes, this is an argument that has never been in front of Court and we don't think the Court now faced with it should accept it. And if --"
2019.18-1323,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3222.64,3224.88,"General, I know you have limited time."
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3236.68,3238.6,"So I -- I -- I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.18-1323,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3253.4,3255.08,"I mean, that wasn't this case, right?"
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3255.08,3259.52,"Well, I -- I -- I would say that competence is, I think, a pretty key factor in what the hospitals do."
2019.18-1323,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3260.2,3261.32,On -- on this record?
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3261.32,3274.92,"I think if you look at the joint commission standards that are in the record, but my only point to the Chief Justice was that however we -- however we think about that, they can vary depending on how the credentialing system works in a particular state. If I can just make one last point on the merits."
2019.18-1323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3316.12,3318.4,The answer -- each of those has an answer.
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3332.72,3333.0,And -- and --
2019.18-1323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3333.0,3333.36,Okay.
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3369.24,3371.96,So I -- I think Doe 2's in -- in Shreveport.
2019.18-1323,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3397.96,3399.36,Can that be done?
2019.18-1323,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3399.36,3399.68,Is it not --
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3399.68,3406.56,But on this record I'm very skeptical that they can't.
2019.18-1323,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3406.56,3437.36,"Is it not -- is it not a reality, is it not really the fact, that almost all hospitals in the State of Louisiana do have an admission, you have to have an admission record in order to admit patients? There is something in the record to that effect that you -- you don't get -- if you don't send patients to the hospital, you don't get admission privileges."
2019.18-1323,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3437.36,3438.16,You may answer.
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3438.16,3445.4,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that's difficult to square with the fact that Doe 5, who does not have an OB-GYN practice, got privileges at Touro."
2019.18-1323,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3461.76,3463.12,"Thank you, General."
2019.18-1323,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3463.12,3464.04,Thank you.
2019.18-1323,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3464.04,3468.6,"Five minutes, Ms. Rikelman."
2019.18-1323,3,63232,julie_rikelman,,3468.6,3498.16,"Your Honor, the lack of benefits of these laws is not state-dependent. The medical consensus is clear that in no state do they serve health and safety benefits. And, in fact, even the federal government a few months ago removed an admitting privileges requirement from its regulations of surgery centers nationwide, finding that the requirement is medically unnecessary and imposes burdens. And as Justice Kagan asked, this Court rejected an alleged credentialing benefit in Whole Woman's Health."
2019.18-1323,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3576.52,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
