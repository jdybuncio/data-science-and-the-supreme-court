2012.11-798,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.77,"We will hear argument next in Case 11-798, American Trucking Associations v. City of Los Angeles."
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,8.856,16.276,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-798,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,71.179,82.502,"I thought that the Port said we don't apply criminal penalties which come from the tariff, we don't apply those to licensed motor carriers."
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,87.289,95.228,"--They -- they did make that representation and we could accept that, but it's irrelevant because the Port is still imposing the criminal penalties on the terminal operators."
2012.11-798,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,140.007,144.242,"Can I break down your arguments into two components, if you might?"
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,197.193,207.482,"--It's -- it's different in this case, Your Honor, because -- in addition to the overlay that 14506 specifically targets identification requirements, and -- and for purposes of this case, it's -- but I understand--"
2012.11-798,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,207.482,220.222,"But even if that, if we didn't have a market participant, why couldn't the State say: When you come into the terminal, you just got to put a little placard in so we know that you're not parking here overnight when you've already been unloaded or something else?"
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,220.222,230.93,"--I think you need to look to the particulars of this case, and the -- and the fact is that the placard requirement here is codified into an ordinance, it's backed by criminal penalties, and it's restricting access to a channel of commerce."
2012.11-798,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,234.399,245.774,"Could the terminal say, we have a pollution problem and only modern trucks can come and unload here?"
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,245.774,246.74,No.
2012.11-798,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,246.74,253.28,So they have to take trucks that are too heavy for this crane to lift?
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,253.28,260.283,"Heavy is a different scenario, Justice Sotomayor, because there's an express exception to the FAAAA for weight and size restrictions."
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.486,297.741,"Even though -- even though a related statute did -- did make an exception for proprietary action, isn't that right?"
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,300.107,301.293,The ADA.
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.293,302.259,The ADA.
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,302.259,317.219,"Yes, that's quite right, and precisely because that statute contained an exception and this Court has recognized that when Congress enacted the FAAAA, it copied the ADA, and it copied the express preemption clause, but it -- Congress chose not to include that proprietary exception."
2012.11-798,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.219,327.344,"Do we know why, why Congress had a different regulation for ports and for airfields?"
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,327.344,331.146,I don't believe the record -- the legislative history doesn't show why.
2012.11-798,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,364.117,372.306,"Except in Boston Harbor, we said that there was a presumption in favor of it unless Congress explicitly indicated to the contrary."
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,372.306,376.525,"Well, Boston Harbor spoke to express or implied indication of congressional intent."
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.347,386.213,"Boston Harbor was implied preemption, right?"
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,386.213,387.832,"--That's correct, Your Honor, it was implied preemption."
2012.11-798,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,463.549,472.838,Do we need to get into the market exception if we find that this is -- has the force or effect of law rather than being a private contract?
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,472.838,473.571,--No.
2012.11-798,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,475.623,478.825,"It's one or the other -- or both, but we could choose."
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,478.825,481.041,--It either has the force and effect of law or it doesn't.
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.181,495.618,"Some -- some of the rules are okay, though, as you acknowledge, and I guess there's a second question in the case."
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,495.618,496.286,--There is.
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.686,497.786,You were about to get into that anyway.
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,497.786,499.452,"--I was going to, but thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.452,499.821,Okay.
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,499.821,503.856,"I was going to get to the second question in the case, which is this Court's decision in Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines."
2012.11-798,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,529.673,534.909,That matters -- that matters in your view whether it's a key component of commerce or not.
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,541.381,554.373,"--Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, Castle spoke to partial suspensions of a motor carrier's right to operate interstate commerce and I think it cannot be denied that in this case, because of the nature of the Port, it is -- it would affect a partial suspension."
2012.11-798,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,557.158,559.692,"Well, I think you have to get into it since I asked you a question about it."
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,560.025,561.442,"--You're quite right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.51,568.548,Or maybe you should stop referring to a key component of interstate commerce.
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,570.498,570.998,--That's quite correct.
2012.11-798,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,579.454,598.9,"So they say there's this particular road, through a State park or something, that's scenic, and sometimes the trucks drive on the side of the road and it causes damage to what the State's trying to preserve, and they have a rule: Look, if you do that three times and we warn you, the fourth time you can't use this road."
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,600.75,601.435,--That is--
2012.11-798,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,601.435,603.119,There is another road not too far away.
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,603.802,605.252,--That is preempted under Castle.
2012.11-798,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,619.279,620.831,"Castle's didn't say that, Mr. Lerman."
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,633.488,641.425,"--Justice Kagan, the conventional forms of punishment include, as we acknowledge, taking an unsafe truck out of service or denying access."
2012.11-798,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,684.352,688.504,But why does that -- why does it have to be truck by truck rather than operator by operator?
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,704.765,707.117,"Because that's what Castle dealt with, Your Honor."
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.839,720.458,Does the Federal Government inspect trucks for safety and--
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,720.458,721.727,--It has regulatory--
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.727,724.429,--leaking hazardous materials and such?
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,724.429,728.297,"--I don't know that it inspects it directly, and it has provisions for States to do that."
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.957,742.84,Has it ever done that?
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,742.84,761.902,"--I don't know if it's ever done that, but what it has done is -- is what Castle said, which is -- is -- there was no reason to -- to deny that the conventional forms of punishment are sufficient to protect the State's safety concerns, and then if they are not sufficient there was then and there still exists a remedy, which is to go to the Department of Transportation and ask them."
2012.11-798,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,792.185,805.345,Can I make a somewhat -- this is how I'm seeing the case and there is some mystery in it to me and it would affect how I might write this thing or consider it.
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,884.281,886.447,I think that's--
2012.11-798,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.447,887.399,So what do you suggest?
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,889.049,891.718,"--You're right that it's not in the case, Your Honor."
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.778,907.327,You -- you agree with that -- that that provision would apply?
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,909.096,910.062,I don't know if it applies.
2012.11-798,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.181,911.864,Route restrictions?
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,911.864,912.948,I don't think this is a route restriction.
2012.11-798,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,915.233,918.702,"I mean, you can't say, don't drive our truck through the neighborhood?"
2012.11-798,0,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,929.176,935.23,"--Not only are we arguing a different question, I think that gets to -- and I would like to answer this question and then reserve my time for rebuttal if I might."
2012.11-798,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,960.562,961.547,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,977.307,979.426,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2012.11-798,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,979.426,988.614,"Do you think the city could pass a regulation like as Justice Breyer suggested, that says, stay off residential streets?"
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,988.614,995.368,"--Well, if the city were to pass that regulation, they'd have to make out a record that it either -- it comes within one -- one of the exceptions."
2012.11-798,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1062.678,1066.897,"Mr. Bash, what would you think of this case if the criminal penalties were taken out of it?"
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1089.246,1089.496,Yes.
2012.11-798,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1142.145,1143.229,"Well, that's not true."
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1158.906,1167.346,"I think it's true that Wal-Mart might say: Hey, we don't do business with labor law violators, or we adhere to certain environmental practices, as part of a marketing campaign."
2012.11-798,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1194.096,1205.402,"Is it part of your argument that the city contracts with the port and then the port contracts with the truckers, but at that point, the ports are -- are confined in what they can do?"
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1210.039,1212.658,"Justice Kennedy, that -- that's like our third order argument."
2012.11-798,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1258.952,1265.458,"Mr. Bash, how then do you deal with the problem that precipitated all of this?"
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1288.808,1291.108,We're -- we're not saying it has no recourse.
2012.11-798,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1310.82,1321.876,And how could a port respond to the complaints if you're making this -- this neighborhood around the Port an environmental hazard?
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1328.781,1340.589,"To -- to deal with that sort of effectively political opposition, community opposition, I think the Port retains a lot of flexibility under the statute to address them."
2012.11-798,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1355.432,1355.915,But wait.
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1389.52,1392.622,I took Justice Ginsburg's question to be addressing a slightly different point.
2012.11-798,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1395.657,1396.24,"No, no, it says,"
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1416.587,1417.27,--There -- there may be.
2012.11-798,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.939,1419.855,I don't think there is.
2012.11-798,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1423.326,1424.626,I -- I myself don't know.
2012.11-798,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.626,1425.593,Seems to me the answer is no.
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1425.593,1433.197,"But I -- I just wanted to emphasize for Justice Ginsburg, though, that there are a lot of things that ports and other -- other municipal entities can do to address environmental concerns."
2012.11-798,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1523.257,1538.116,"So you -- do you think that a statute that says if you're trucking company operator and you have three violations of X safety regulations, you just can't use our highways because we don't trust you, is that okay?"
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1538.116,1540.416,"--No, that's certainly not okay."
2012.11-798,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1546.386,1546.622,Why?
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1571.32,1575.889,"Well, it should be clear at the outset that we're not talking about people; we're talking about motor carriers as an ongoing enterprise."
2012.11-798,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1580.124,1580.691,Finish your answer.
2012.11-798,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1580.691,1592.099,"But more broadly, we think the Federal regulatory scheme in combination with this preemption provision just bars States from taking certain actions that would affect the interstate operations of motor carriers."
2012.11-798,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.432,1593.032,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1602.988,1606.356,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.533,1651.635,What exception do you appeal to?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1653.168,1654.254,What--
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.254,1659.071,What exception are you appealing to from the -- from the preemption provision?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1659.071,1666.144,"--Your Honor, my first -- my first exception is the actual force and effect of law."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.827,1678.619,"Well, that's a different point, but -- but you're -- you're talking about, you know, an exception for private contract operations as opposed to public matters."
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1678.619,1679.452,--We're--
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.452,1683.521,There are exceptions to the preemption and that is not one of them.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1693.362,1697.68,"--With -- with due respect, the statute says"
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.935,1736.839,Do market participants impose civil and criminal penalties?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1736.839,1737.206,--Ah.
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.039,1738.622,Ah.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1739.623,1757.502,"--The answer is no, but I think the criminal penalties is a red herring in this case, and if you will -- if you'll just indulge me a moment, the concession agreement everyone concedes does not include any criminal penalties."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.711,1825.994,Is that how we decide these things?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1853.413,1861.667,"Justice Scalia, first of all, the direct criminal penalty doesn't apply to the truckers at all."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.667,1862.252,Okay.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1862.252,1873.392,"So the argument is, this is an indirect effect, and what I'm trying to argue is the indirect effect is not criminal in nature."
2012.11-798,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1883.766,1886.967,"Well, but like a lot of criminal penalties, that's the whole point."
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1901.727,1906.698,"But, Mr. Chief Justice, usually criminal penalties apply to the public."
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.119,1992.554,"Well, that's why the route regulation thing is the exception."
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1994.621,1995.121,But we're not acting--
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1995.121,1995.621,--Pardon me.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2023.038,2029.792,"--My case differs because we are not dealing directly with rates, routes or services."
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.21,2034.346,You're saying it falls outside the definition of “ routes ”.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2041.433,2043.202,--No.
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2043.202,2044.468,The parking regulation--
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2044.468,2045.82,That question was--
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.82,2056.944,"--Well, if it doesn't fall within, then I'm not sure what we're talking about, because I thought the problem was that it does fall within the rates, routes and services, and then the question is, is there proprietary exception, et cetera."
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2056.944,2072.804,"--Well, the -- the answer -- our position is that even if it is rates, routes and services, that what we are doing is not regulation, that this is proprietary."
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.804,2076.606,"That's why I asked you, and how does it differ from the hypothetical I just put."
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2076.606,2098.188,"I think -- I think -- it differs from that because we're not prescribing any -- if we are describing -- if we are prescribing it, it's inherent within our ability to access our particular land."
2012.11-798,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.188,2103.423,You are saying that you can do by contract what you cannot do by regulation.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2109.244,2116.25,"But, Justice Kennedy, let me say again, there are no criminal penalties that attach to the breach of the contract."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2128.724,2129.408,I'm not sure that's crucial.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2148.471,2149.671,"No, no, no."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.151,2171.501,Okay.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2186.444,2192.148,--But we're not -- we're not dealing with that hypothetical.
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2192.148,2193.25,I know we're not.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2194.7,2201.17,"But there's a difference, and let me give you the difference, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.708,2233.625,Okay.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2238.195,2239.445,"No, no, we're not--"
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.445,2241.364,And that makes it okay?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2241.364,2241.881,--No.
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.039,2332.324,It was implied preemption in Boston Harbor.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2356.189,2359.158,"It's not the only thing, Justice Scalia, I'm relying on."
2012.11-798,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2558.439,2562.907,"Mr. Rosenthal, could I interrupt you for a second and just make sure I understand what your policy is?"
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2570.513,2574.049,"Well, in fact, we don't exclude anybody from the Port."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.266,2601.999,What -- what if they violate those conditions?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2614.357,2618.911,"--Well, we -- we -- there's a gradation of remedies."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.874,2639.874,What's the ultimate?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2643.809,2655.853,"--In -- in cases involving fraud, criminal penalties of a continuing nature, we can suspend or revoke their right to come on to the property."
2012.11-798,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2660.921,2668.493,"And -- and not just the noncompliant trucks, but the entire operator who are having some noncompliant trucks, is that correct?"
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2668.493,2684.036,"--Again, we -- this -- there hasn't been this experience of -- of having to revoke and -- and suspend in cases like what you're describing."
2012.11-798,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2693.142,2702.915,"Well, if you're saying there isn't that experience, I mean, could -- are you in a position actually to represent that you would not exclude anything except noncompliant trucks?"
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2702.915,2706.619,There -- there hasn't been the experience.
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2740.44,2750.83,"There are three reasons, and the first one, I -- I'm not sure why it wouldn't survive in a policy of deregulation if it seemed to apply a fortiori, or equally, but I don't want to argue that with you."
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2752.897,2753.247,--Yes.
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.982,2760.234,But what is the second and third?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2760.234,2780.897,"Second -- second argument -- second argument is that even under the Castle regime, all Castle talked about is going -- allowing a truck to go up to a customer's property line, that -- that a certificate of convenience and necessity never gave anyone permission to go into Wal-Mart or anything else."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2805.363,2806.198,I've never heard of this doctrine.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2809.95,2814.887,"--Well, but -- it's a -- it's a facial attack to -- it is."
2012.11-798,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.555,2825.943,"--We have to attack this contract provision by provision, or application by application?"
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2825.943,2831.58,But -- but they're arguing that our contract is tantamount to a law.
2012.11-798,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2831.58,2832.13,Right.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2835.215,2835.815,Right.
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2850.408,2851.291,And what's the one that would be?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2855.21,2856.229,Yes.
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.229,2857.812,"--and its applications, it would be--"
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2857.812,2865.416,"Where -- where a truck is in continuing violation, a company is in continuing violation of a safety restriction."
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.416,2865.899,--All right.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2882.11,2882.943,Because--
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2882.943,2884.126,That's what it's concerned about.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2909.008,2911.876,"--Let me -- let me try to respond, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-798,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2933.126,2936.161,"Could I just go back, because--"
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2936.161,2937.878,You certainly may.
2012.11-798,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2937.878,2939.363,--the theoretical questions.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2946.866,2947.483,Yes.
2012.11-798,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2947.483,2948.301,All right?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2963.061,2977.253,"If -- if it does, it submits an off-street parking plan for all of the trucks which are registered to go onto the property, and it has to agree to keep those trucks in the off-site parking."
2012.11-798,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2982.723,2983.909,I just wanted to make sure.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,2990.478,2991.495,--That -- that's correct.
2012.11-798,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2991.495,2992.028,All right.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3007.69,3010.726,"No, it does not have to be permanently affixed to the truck."
2012.11-798,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3010.726,3011.842,"Well, how does that help you?"
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3013.844,3024.719,"Well, there were -- we -- we provide them if they want a sticker they can put on their truck, but we don't require it."
2012.11-798,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3075.068,3076.134,--So how is the public going to use that plaque?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3076.134,3076.817,What?
2012.11-798,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3076.817,3078.434,How is the public going to use that?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3083.054,3096.712,"There are -- there are -- there are members of the public include also the people who are on -- at the MTO, also other truckers."
2012.11-798,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3125.065,3132.919,Would you clarify -- would you clarify what the -- what happens when there is an infraction?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3149.695,3166.988,"--We -- we are -- there has been very little practice, Justice Ginsburg, under that, but basically our enforcement where there have been violations has been to ban the particular truck in question, not the entire LMC."
2012.11-798,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3166.988,3167.49,But you could do the other.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3187.068,3192.622,We -- we have built in a gradation.
2012.11-798,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3198.192,3200.228,Let's say it's a major violation.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3200.228,3218.522,"If it were a major violation involving something we believe was systemic within the LMC, the -- the -- not the regulation, but the concession agreement would leave the possibility that we could revoke or suspend until the problem was corrected."
2012.11-798,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3219.655,3222.157,And how about after it's corrected?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3228.561,3232.197,--We have -- we have never enforced it that way.
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3335.497,3342.336,"Make -- make this argument precisely and substitute for “ port authority ” the words “ city of San Diego ”, okay?"
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3361.065,3361.498,No.
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.248,3362.698,Why?
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3362.698,3363.481,--Justice Breyer.
2012.11-798,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3372.371,3372.873,All right.
2012.11-798,2,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,3373.356,3395.136,"These -- the port is operating as an enterprise not because it has the label “ enterprise ”, but because this is a business and as a business we should be entitled under even-handedness to do what a Wal-Mart or any other company could do to enable us to prosper, grow, and nurture our business enterprise."
2012.11-798,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3399.271,3400.023,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-798,3,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,3401.473,3407.96,"Justice Scalia, the criminal penalties are not a red herring."
2012.11-798,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3411.162,3412.381,I didn't say they were a red herring.
2012.11-798,3,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,3412.381,3413.314,"--I know you didn't, Your Honor."
2012.11-798,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3486.162,3493.233,But I thought there -- there was a representation made that they toe the line that the government draws.
2012.11-798,3,21104,daniel_n_lerman,,3524.087,3533.71,"I don't agree and I think counsel said right here that they reserve the authority to suspend access for past or ongoing violations, and that runs afoul of Castle under its plain terms."
