1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.65,"We'll hear arguments next in 6067, Duren against Missouri."
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,53.412,56.942,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-6067,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,81.724,86.076,"Mr. Nation, if you excuse me, there's a crank on the side that you'd -- lift it up."
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,86.076,87.117,"Okay, thank you."
1978.77-6067,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,88.343,89.382,What I mean that microphone.
1978.77-6067,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,89.382,90.285,We can hear you better.
1978.77-6067,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,90.285,90.976,That microphone.
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,90.976,98.316,"No, up the other way."
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,98.316,111.899,"Mr. Duren's motion to quash filed before trial was overruled and he was convicted of murder in the first degree by an all male jury. Of course, our challenge here is bottomed upon Taylor versus Louisiana."
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,128.881,130.316,"Wait a minute, did you say the on the jury or on the jury panel?"
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,130.316,132.329,On the jury panel.
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,132.329,132.502,Not the jury.
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,132.502,135.381,Jury panel.
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.642,312.667,"Mr. Nation, the Supreme Court of Missouri expressed some dissatisfaction with your numerical claims."
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,317.887,327.129,"Well, the Missouri Supreme Court cited new -- can you be specific as to which claim they -- you're referring to?"
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,327.129,345.925,"Well, I am -- I think it's the court's majority and I don't have the opinion directly before me, but it's a phrase that casts some -- gives some indication it is not satisfied in it that you have satisfactorily demonstrated the facts in which you're relying but goes on to treat it --"
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,345.925,346.294,Yes.
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.294,346.882,-- as if you had nothing left.
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,346.882,347.937,There are several things.
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.996,460.705,You mean a federal constitutional provision of your Missouri (Voice Overlap)?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,460.705,463.632,The Missouri constitutional provision.
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,491.322,498.0,Is that because of some lesser registration in the voting process by women?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,498.0,512.53,"Well, the statistics that are in our brief indicate that in Missouri, men registered to vote -- 71% of the men were registered to vote and 69.9% of the women registered to vote."
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,518.642,527.24,"Then when their -- when the wheel is made up, it doesn't reflect the voter population on your figures, you've got definitely 70 to 60."
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,527.24,528.822,That's correct.
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,528.822,530.203,Any explanation for that in the record?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,530.203,532.908,70 to 69%.
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,532.908,535.49,"Well, roughly 70."
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,535.49,539.227,"Excuse me, I didn't -- what was your question?"
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.227,548.792,Any explanation for why the drawings don't average out fairly close to the --
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,548.792,573.259,"I imagine the -- the computer selects people from the voter registration rolls and we don't know exactly what percentage of those people selected or those people who were sent questionnaires are men and women because obviously, some of the questionnaires never returned."
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,690.142,699.34,Where do you get that from that you -- the const -- the federal constitution prohibits a state from excluding any identifiable group?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,699.34,702.161,From the past precedents of this Court.
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.161,703.53,Such as?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,703.53,705.249,Such as Taylor.
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.249,706.521,Is that what Taylor said?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,706.521,714.891,That it -- a state cannot exclude an identifiable group by -- on juries.
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.891,720.047,Would you carry that beyond discrimination between the sexes or what other identifiable groups?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,720.047,722.128,"Blacks, Mexican-Americans."
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,722.128,723.532,How beyond that?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,723.532,726.138,That's -- I think that's about as far as we've gone.
1978.77-6067,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,726.138,731.753,How about lawyers and judges and dentists and doctors and clergymen and teachers?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,731.753,739.637,That doesn't -- the prior cases in the federal circuits have not held those to be identifiable groups.
1978.77-6067,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.637,740.873,"But they are, and that even in the common meaning of that phrase."
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,740.873,755.751,"Well, they're identifiable groups in a common sense language but as in terms of jury, in the jury cases, they have not been recognized as important enough that we need to include them on juries."
1978.77-6067,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.129,768.105,Don't you think a lawyer can make a much bigger impact if he's a member of a jury than a woman as a woman or a Mexican-American as a Mexican-American?
1978.77-6067,0,34903,lee_m_nation,,768.105,771.068,"Well, perhaps he might be able to."
1978.77-6067,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,802.12,804.73,"Mrs. Ginsburg, you may lower the lectern if you would like."
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1527.445,1531.351,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-6067,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.084,1622.748,Are you suggesting that there are generally in the category of physicians and others who's as -- who was conceded by I think your friends in the other side of the table was permissible exclusion on the part of the state for reasons of public policy?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1622.748,1626.05,I think an exemption does not exclude women or doctors.
1978.77-6067,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1626.05,1627.051,Well --
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1627.051,1629.395,It gives them the opportunity not to participate if they choose.
1978.77-6067,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1629.395,1632.892,"Well, what do you call it, exemption or exclusion?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1656.106,1660.957,"Yes, Your Honor it is essentially the same as any exemption which the State of Missouri Courts."
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.957,1668.209,"Is it true that they have -- the woman has two, a woman doctor has two exemptions?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1668.209,1669.888,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1669.888,1672.65,And you don't see any thing wrong with that?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1672.65,1676.606,I think it is wrong if there is a violation of the Sixth Amendment.
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1689.938,1702.804,"Well, isn't that the direct result of them having only 0.9 women on the jury, the direct result of the Missouri practice?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1702.804,1707.395,Your Honor we would submit that no it is not and the --
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.395,1707.63,And what --
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1707.63,1708.472,If petitioner has not shown it to be.
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1708.472,1709.67,What would cause it?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1723.636,1733.233,"Petition -- Your Honor, we do not believe that it is the obligation of the state to show why there was so few women on the jury but rather that the burden of proof was on the petitioner."
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1733.233,1738.739,"-- if you're unreasonably requested to do so, can you?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1738.739,1739.547,No Your Honor because we --
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1739.547,1741.933,"You can't justify it, can you?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1741.933,1743.88,What do you mean by justification?
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1743.88,1745.691,What the word it says.
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1745.691,1750.85,The reduction in the number of women available or the reason for the exemption?
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.85,1754.065,"The reason for the exemption, one."
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1754.065,1757.403,"One, no."
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.212,1785.823,And at a time when --
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1785.823,1786.847,Those --
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1786.847,1789.871,They weren't even qualified to vote?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1789.871,1793.608,"Yes Your Honor, that is true and I think this Court in the past has characterized those as --"
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1793.608,1795.788,"Oh, they make contracts."
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1797.499,1799.023,Yes Your Honor and I think --
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.023,1804.848,They just couldn't do anything but tend a home.
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1804.848,1825.911,I think the question Your Honor is not whether we can justify the exemption because we only need to justify the exemption once it has been shown to be a violation of the Sixth Amendment and once it has been shown to operate in such a way that there are so few women on the jury panel that it is no longer fairly representative of the community.
1978.77-6067,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1926.622,1929.211,Didn't Taylor say so?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1929.211,1933.768,"Yes Your Honor, Taylor did say so."
1978.77-6067,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.768,1937.669,Taylor is based on an outmoded stereotype is what you're saying.
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,1940.145,1946.799,I submit that that is in fact.
1978.77-6067,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2032.685,2042.437,"Ms. Laughrey, let me get back for a moment if I may to your comment about the outmoded stereotype in response to Justice Stevens' question."
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2086.277,2090.804,"That may be Your Honor, I don't know, is there a question?"
1978.77-6067,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.804,2111.665,"Well, the question, you say in effect that it didn't make any difference to Billy Duren that there weren't that many women on the jury because there really isn't much -- the concept that women would react differently than men is outmoded or did I misinterpretation your --?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2111.665,2115.018,"No, that was correct Your Honor."
1978.77-6067,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.118,2278.393,"Suppose, it was sought that prima facie case had been made out, does the state -- what's the state's strongest argument in justification or do you have one?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2278.393,2280.943,Are you talking about justification for the exemption?
1978.77-6067,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.943,2286.612,"Yes, for treating women different than men and in terms of excuse."
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2286.612,2300.427,We recognize that women still play a primary role in the home that even though women may in fact be working mothers does not mean that they have been relieved of the responsibilities of their obligations to the home or to their family.
1978.77-6067,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.135,2322.23,Is that -- is that a -- do you think that's the legislative decision?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2322.23,2325.861,The justification for this exemption?
1978.77-6067,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2336.606,2347.542,"Well, under McGowan against Maryland if there was any rational reason for it, we'd give that considerable weight I suppose, would we, should we?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2347.542,2354.874,"Yes, but again, it's not an equal protection case."
1978.77-6067,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2467.345,2470.454,What happens to a man who does not respond to the summons?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2470.454,2478.291,The testimony is that the police will make an attempt to find out why he has not responding.
1978.77-6067,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2478.291,2481.02,"Well, (Voice Overlap) if they find out, I just -- if they didn't want to serve."
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2481.02,2483.148,There is a distinction at that point.
1978.77-6067,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2483.148,2487.174,"And he tells the police I just didn't want to serve, that's a reason I didn't respond."
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2489.976,2495.103,He is subject to be in held in contempt of court.
1978.77-6067,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.407,2558.112,Is Jackson County a Kansas city?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2558.112,2559.963,"Jackson County is Kansas City, Missouri."
1978.77-6067,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.963,2562.872,How many counties are there in Missouri?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2562.872,2565.805,Your Honor I do not have the answer to that question.
1978.77-6067,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.166,2587.587,"So a case based on statistics from Jackson County although it would affect the substantial number of people in Missouri would not be determinative of other convictions obtained in other counties, I take it?"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2587.587,2604.356,"I think that is the -- certainly the import of Taylor is that it is only when it results and in underrepresentation in a particular case and if it doesn't result in under representation in Saint Louis or Boom County, does that mean that, you know the exemption is still valid."
1978.77-6067,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.356,2620.283,So a federal habeas judge sitting in the Western District of Missouri maybe scanning convictions of -- if the Supreme Court of Missouri has reversed 50 different counties and he's going to have to get evidence as to the functioning of the jury system and each of those counties before he can decide.
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2620.283,2639.533,"Well, that's true Your Honor but we would submit that even if the Missouri Supreme Court were reversed in this case that this is not a situation that should be made retroactive that we think that the rules which were applicable in Taylor versus Louisiana are equally applicable in this case for two reasons."
1978.77-6067,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2738.237,2749.192,Are you hinting at a harmless error even assuming all that your friends say that it's harmless error?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2749.192,2751.272,No Your Honor.
1978.77-6067,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2753.579,2753.783,"No, but --"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2753.783,2755.875,-- that there is any prejudice in this case.
1978.77-6067,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2755.875,2762.943,"-- an alternate, I wonder whether you're making an alternative argument that this is harmless error even if otherwise (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2762.943,2777.634,"No, I'm saying that if you decide that it was error and it was unconstitutional and you're considering whether it is retroactive or not you look at the question of what did the constitutional provision protect."
1978.77-6067,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.32,2839.072,And does a -- what percentage of the convicts who were convicted in Jackson County -- what percentage of those are still in -- who've been convicted since Taylor are still there?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2839.072,2842.516,Your Honor we of course do not have those statistics at this time.
1978.77-6067,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2886.815,2891.218,Daniels against Louisiana was the case that held the Taylor doctrine not retroactive?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2891.218,2892.465,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6067,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.465,2894.546,I don't -- is it cited in your brief?
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2894.546,2895.566,No it is not.
1978.77-6067,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2895.637,2900.138,"Do you remember the citation, 400 and something, 15 or --"
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2900.138,2907.933,I do not have the citation with me.
1978.77-6067,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2907.933,2911.149,"After Taylor, 420 something."
1978.77-6067,2,37182,nanette_laughrey,,2911.149,2913.866,"If there are no further questions, thank you very much."
1978.77-6067,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2913.866,2914.238,Very well.
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,2916.807,2916.857,Yes.
1978.77-6067,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2916.857,2929.011,You seem didn't have -- there seems to be disagreement on the factual situation between you and the state about the women who do not return their questionnaires.
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,2933.326,2945.544,The statement made in our reply brief was that women who do not return the questionnaires and who do not follow the request of the summons do not appear for jury service.
1978.77-6067,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2945.544,2947.74,That isn't quite the way you put it in your argument.
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,2948.404,2954.301,"It was something like that in the brief that -- yes, and that's the reason that the wheel is as high as it is."
1978.77-6067,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.201,3014.474,You don't claim the Missouri statute though is unconstitutional in all situations.
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,3018.019,3026.251,"Well, under Taylor, you have to prove that there is an exemption and that there is underrepresentation."
1978.77-6067,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3036.989,3043.145,That is because of your statistical showing as well as because of the practices and procedures in Jackson County?
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,3043.145,3044.952,Yes.
1978.77-6067,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3051.829,3057.677,"In the -- in a specific case, could this ever -- in your view be harmless error?"
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,3057.677,3065.485,Only in a case where there is absolutely no question of credibility for the jury.
1978.77-6067,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.895,3090.808,"Well, what if a defendant on the stand under cross-examination has as it has happened in some cases, testified in a way that its added up to essentially a judicial confession of the crime, would you think that'd be the kind that could be harmless error?"
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,3090.808,3113.739,"Well, Your Honor as a criminal defense lawyer, I have occasionally had instances where my client -- the only reason where a trial is not to contest the facts but to try and receive a light sentence because in Missouri the jury sentences and it's my experience that women are much more sympathetic towards defendants than men are."
1978.77-6067,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3115.004,3117.629,"(Voice Overlap) fungible, it's a -- was --"
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,3117.629,3118.902,I don't think they're fungible.
1978.77-6067,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3118.902,3123.669,I think we're going to give a lot of trouble cause that wasn't my experience.
1978.77-6067,3,34903,lee_m_nation,,3123.669,3130.828,"There is -- I don't know how many, there are seven I believe petitions for certiorari on this issue before the Court."
1978.77-6067,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3157.036,3157.738,Thank you counsel.
