1982.81-2150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.121,We'll hear arguments next in McNeff against Todd.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,58.271,61.114,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.377,841.577,"Mr. Winkler, I think in your briefs you didn't deal with the Section 306(a) of the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments, Plan Amendments Act of 1980."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,843.888,845.027,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.369,849.465,I guess I didn't notice that.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,850.105,850.744,Okay.
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.416,854.683,May I just ask one question here?
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,854.683,855.229,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.229,861.819,"If I understand you correctly, the enforceabilty of the agreement depends on whether or not there was in fact a majority status."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,861.819,862.834,That is correct.
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.834,866.238,"And when, in your view, is it appropriate for that determination to be made?"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,878.733,879.95,That is correct.
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.2,893.149,"Would you say that if the... if the company had in fact made the payments and then realized that the union never acquired majority status, that it could sue for a refund?"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,893.149,894.334,I don't believe so.
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.498,969.337,"Would it also be true that the employer could pay below the union scale as long as nobody complained about it and then later on the employees might say, well, you signed the pre-hire agreement which... well, in this case I take it there was an undertaking to pay according to the union scale."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,972.161,973.116,That is correct.
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.116,973.506,Yes.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,973.506,976.832,The entire agreement is unenforceable in the Board's position.
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.832,980.627,"It's just a matter of voluntary, unless the employer voluntarily elects to do--"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,980.627,981.208,That's right.
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.208,981.754,--what he said he would.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,981.754,988.593,And it's because that it is inconsistent with employee rights just to in effect recognize a minority union.
1982.81-2150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1136.111,1138.128,"We will resume there at 1:00, Counsel."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1138.128,1139.173,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.173,1162.929,"You may resume, Counsel."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1162.929,1165.414,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.483,1225.684,"Mr. Winkler, you know, it's correct about your opponent, but, you know, the government cited the R.J. Smith case."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1227.653,1228.589,--I am sorry?
1982.81-2150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.589,1233.853,The Solicitor General cited the R.J. Smith case and seems to think it's distinguishable.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1233.853,1235.292,I disagree.
1982.81-2150,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1496.212,1503.944,"Mr. Winkler, 306(a), the language there is collectively bargained agreement."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1512.831,1515.533,--I notice the distinction in the language there.
1982.81-2150,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1524.545,1531.042,"Well, clearly enough, a pre-hire agreement is not yet a collective bargaining agreement."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1535.541,1536.742,"--Oh, I would say not."
1982.81-2150,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1536.742,1537.21,Why not?
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1537.21,1537.916,The idea of collectively--
1982.81-2150,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1537.916,1538.4,Why not?
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1538.4,1540.837,--collectively bargained assumes that the--
1982.81-2150,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1540.837,1546.538,"Well, if they sat down and bargained, even though it was a minority pre-hire agreement, isn't that--"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1546.538,1546.912,--That'd be--
1982.81-2150,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1546.912,1550.161,--collectively bargained even if it's not a collective bargaining agreement?
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1550.161,1561.531,"--The idea of collective bargaining assumes the idea that they're acting as the agent of the employees, as the collective bargaining agent for those employees."
1982.81-2150,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1561.531,1570.166,"Well, do you think Congressmen... Congress chose that language, ""collectively bargained agreement"", purposely to indicate maybe a distinction?"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1570.166,1572.213,I do not believe that they did.
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1641.027,1647.637,What is necessary for the employer to escape the pre-hire agreement under the judgment that you are attacking.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1647.637,1660.88,"Basically, if the... if the unions... if it is not established that the union represents the majority of the employees, then the contract is not enforceable."
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.88,1663.567,I know that is your... that is your view.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1668.097,1670.847,"They have to, in effect, give a notice of repudiation."
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.847,1676.969,And that notice of repudiation cannot be just a refusal to abide by the contract?
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1676.969,1678.622,"Basically, if they say not."
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.322,1696.209,"But even if it were... even if a refusal to comply was a notice as to the future, it wouldn't be effective to negate obligations accrued up to that time."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1696.209,1698.038,That's true.
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.038,1705.252,And your... your view is that nothing in the contract is binding on the employer until there's a majority representation.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1705.252,1705.923,That's true.
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.643,1716.249,"Well, the Board... I don't know how you can say it's the Board's view when the general counsel is on this brief for the government."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1716.249,1719.076,"--Well, the general counsel and the Board--"
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.076,1720.48,Are not one and the same.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1720.48,1721.825,--are not one and the same.
1982.81-2150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.65,1730.041,"Well, we have recognized that for some purposes, have we not?"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1731.835,1732.225,That's true.
1982.81-2150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.705,1758.512,"But if the counsel or the Board makes a representation to this Court in a case of this kind, you suggest that that carries no weight?"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1758.512,1763.354,"Oh, it should be given some weight, but then again I think you should take a look at the Board decisions itself."
1982.81-2150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1763.354,1768.853,"Is this a case where his independence is directly involved, counsel's independence?"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1768.853,1770.978,I can't say that.
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.725,1773.676,"Well, this is an amicus case."
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1775.302,1776.457,That's right.
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.457,1783.815,"--to this case, and then there's a brief filed on its behalf, you should be able to assume that it represents the Board's view, shouldn't you?"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1783.815,1785.66,Well--
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.66,1787.314,But that isn't the case here.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1787.314,1790.453,--In Higdon the brief was on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board.
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.453,1792.437,This is the brief of the United States.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1792.437,1792.983,I know.
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.372,1794.813,And not the Board.
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1794.813,1797.262,--filed on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board.
1982.81-2150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.262,1798.825,"It was the brief of a party in Higdon, wasn't it?"
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1798.825,1799.917,That's correct.
1982.81-2150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.991,1811.959,Did the Board prevail in Higdon?
1982.81-2150,0,33511,james_t_winkler,,1811.959,1813.847,"Yes, it did."
1982.81-2150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.358,1909.151,Mr. Jett.
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,1909.151,1909.931,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.696,2078.344,"Well, what happens in a... outside the construction industry when... when an employer purports to recognize a minority union and execute a contract with that union?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2078.344,2080.766,"It is an unfair labor practice, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.766,2085.389,"Well, is it enforceable in a 301 action?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2085.389,2088.637,"Your Honor, it would not be, because--"
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.637,2089.791,Why not?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2089.791,2090.727,--Because--
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.727,2091.948,Give me your argument.
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2091.948,2098.133,"--According to our argument, we would agree with this Court's decision in Carey versus Westinghouse Electric."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.91,2119.733,"Well, that may be the authority of the Board, but what about the... what about a 301 case?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2119.733,2135.869,"--Well, Your Honor, as far as an unfair labor practice involved in a 301 case in the situation you're talking about, if there is an allegation of an unfair labor practice, it must be submitted to the Board in the form of a charge."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.445,2160.218,"Wel, suppose that an employer signs... outside the construction industry, signs a contract with a minority union and perhaps everybody promising to pay a certain wage, and one day he just lowers the wage unilaterally, and then he gets sued in a 301 action for... for the contract wage."
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2160.218,2162.452,"--Your Honor, as a matter of fact, that exact circumstance--"
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.452,2162.936,What happens?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2162.936,2164.636,--has just been litigated in the Ninth Circuit.
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.636,2165.591,What happens?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2165.591,2167.556,It's the Glazers case that was cited in our brief.
1982.81-2150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.674,2186.363,"But the employees couldn't sue under those circumstances, a 301 action?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2186.363,2188.344,"They could sue, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.628,2190.876,"Well, could they collect?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2193.36,2218.206,"--The... the Iron Workers... the Glazers case enforces the contract and says it does so because the unfair labor practice must be kept under the primary jurisdiction of the Board and that otherwise that would require litigation of the intent of the unfair labor practice statutes in Section 301 cases, and the Ninth Circuit in the Glazers versus Custom Model case declined to do that."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.396,2225.69,So Glazers... your case is a fortiori from the Glazers case?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2225.69,2229.422,--It certainly is highly consistent with our case.
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.054,2311.172,"Well, what's the... under 301 what would be the theory of... that the employer would use if he's sued, just like in this case, and he came back and said, well, I sent you notice last week that I am repudiating the contract?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2318.448,2322.59,"--Your Honor, we have argued that repudiation is not a proper defense."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.087,2327.335,You are different from the Board then?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2327.335,2330.524,We are different from the government's brief in that respect.
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.524,2333.41,"You don't think that's a Board brief, either, eh?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2333.41,2337.968,"Your Honor, it is to the extent that it represents the government's views."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2356.928,2363.412,"Well, is it once you've signed the pre-hire agreement, once the employer signs, under your view, he is permanently stuck with it?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2363.412,2364.536,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.099,2370.19,When is he not subject to suit in the 301 action?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2370.19,2379.577,"--The agreement, according to our argument, is that he would not be bound to the agreement after the Board certifies a union election result that the union has lost."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.811,2389.65,"So the employer, before he can get out of the agreement, he has to... he has to precipitate a representation election?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2389.65,2391.93,"--An election has to be precipitated, we'll put it that way."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.93,2392.648,And he has to win?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2392.648,2393.588,The employer may do it.
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.262,2432.992,"So it changes the burden, the pre-hire changes the burden with respect... it changes the normal rules with respect to how a... how majority status is to be determined?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2432.992,2434.82,"Your Honor, it does not."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.78,2465.182,"Well, I know, but you... the employer, unless there is some solid evidence of majority representation, an employer isn't normally required to act like the union is the majority representative."
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2478.597,2479.018,"Well, Your Honor--"
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.018,2480.238,Or the employees.
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2485.515,2487.623,"--Your Honor, what--"
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.623,2492.046,In order to prove that the union isn't the majority representative.
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2492.046,2505.835,"--What it would force him to do, require him to do is to do what he agreed to do; that is, perform according to the agreement until there is an expression of self-determination by the employees in which they vote out the union."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.835,2508.958,So you... so you do say that pre-hire does change the--
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2508.958,2511.068,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.102,2784.189,"--Well, you would force the... you would force the employer before the Board in any case where he seriously doubted the... the majority status of the union."
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2784.189,2793.969,"Your Honor, in order to present a question of employee representation, it is all... has always been the requirement that that question of representation be presented to the Board."
1982.81-2150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2873.468,2885.323,"Well, Mr. Jett, even if we affirm the Ninth Circuit here, it would have the effect of moving a lot to the courts, wouldn't it, unless your view were adopted in the process?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2885.323,2886.93,"Your Honor, that is correct."
1982.81-2150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2929.555,2940.626,"How do you respond to Mr. Winkler's position, though, that the Board itself has viewed these agreements as unenforceable?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,2940.626,2946.673,"Your Honor, they... the Board has not reviewed... viewed them as unenforceable under 301."
1982.81-2150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3033.559,3047.134,"Incidentally, what do you suggest is the reason that that ERISA Amendment speaks for the collectively bargained agreement rather than a collective bargaining agreement?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3047.134,3056.674,"Your Honor, I believe that it is common usage in ERISA to speak in that terminology as opposed to collective bargaining agreement."
1982.81-2150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3059.128,3061.923,"In other words, this is a different thing than a collective bargaining agreement?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3061.923,3083.368,"--I believe that ERISA, while it intended collectively bargained agreement to apply broadly to these kinds of agreements, I believe they were not concerning themselves with the intricacies of unfair labor practice law in terms of recognizing the policies of the Board in any detail."
1982.81-2150,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3113.448,3117.87,That they may be collectively bargained even if not collective bargaining agreements?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3117.87,3121.556,"--Correct, Your Honor, although I would say this."
1982.81-2150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3159.977,3165.601,Isn't one of the requirements for a collective bargaining agreement that the union has to represent the employees?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3165.601,3168.568,"Your Honor, it is, except in 8(f) cases."
1982.81-2150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3179.563,3190.276,"Well, does 8(f) shed light on whether the... one of the requirements of a collective bargaining agreement is that the union represent the employees?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3190.276,3203.804,"Your Honor, I believe that Section 8(f) specifically contemplates agreements and binding agreements in which it expressly is with a minority union."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3346.088,3360.162,"Well, isn't it true, Mr. Jett, that the... according to your position, it really doesn't make any difference for the purposes of this case where this majority status issue is to be litigated or even whether it is to be."
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3362.802,3364.19,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.19,3374.497,"So you don't... it's... it's... all you have to say is that the majority status has never been determined and you're suing for back pay, so to speak."
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3374.497,3390.383,"In terms of this contract... or this case, it is clear that there was neither repudiation under the Ninth Circuit view or a determination of majority status until after the period that was enforced in the contract."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.351,3397.613,But you would like to go on prevailing on the same contract?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3397.613,3408.657,"--It is most important that the right reasons be given for that prevailing; otherwise, the wrong reasons will undoubtedly lead to erroneous decisions in future cases."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.041,3425.398,"Well, I don't... I don't know."
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3438.504,3448.358,"--Your Honor, as a matter of fact, that is an extremely important point here and one actually that the petitioner has taken both sides of."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.873,3509.319,"Mr. Jett, you don't... I don't think you're going to... you're going to say that every time you sued on a pre-hire agreement and the employer said... said, sorry, but I am repudiating right now, you're not going to wage a losing battle, you're not going to litigate forever when you know you don't have majority status."
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3516.548,3521.86,"Well, Your Honor, of course, our... our trustees, the parties respondent here--"
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.86,3522.266,Yes.
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3522.266,3545.679,"--are in the position of attempting to enforce the fringe benefit rights, and are in the position that in order to... if... if the Ninth Circuit were to be taken at face value on the dictum, would be in the position of having to come up with union majority status proved to see whether it could be proved to the court's satisfaction that that was established before repudiation."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3565.215,3579.993,"Well, you certainly would agree, I suppose, that if the employer took it to the Board, the question of majority status to the Board, and he won, that you haven't got any contract rights?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3579.993,3580.851,"--Your Honor, if we--"
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3580.851,3583.476,From... from at least the prospective.
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3583.476,3585.161,"--From that date forward, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3613.401,3616.93,"And if there is unilateral change, it's an unfair labor practice, is that it?"
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3616.93,3619.398,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3650.902,3656.117,But that's in a case where the union had been at one time certified as the majority representative?
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3656.117,3660.414,"Not necessarily so, Your Honor."
1982.81-2150,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3722.95,3724.653,Your time has expired.
1982.81-2150,1,45120,wayne_jett,,3726.697,3727.512,--Thank you.
1982.81-2150,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3727.512,3728.37,"Thank you, gentlemen."
