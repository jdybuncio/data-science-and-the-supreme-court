2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,2.433,We'll hear argument first--
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,8.737,12.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-6551,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,99.997,112.756,"Mr. Gold, I know you take that position on the facts of this case, but is it not true that there could be cases in which the verdict of the jury would establish certain facts that would justify going beyond the middle term?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,121.945,137.872,"--Your Honor, Justice Stevens, to the extent that a fact is found by the jury which can be used as an aggravating factor, but is not an element of the crime or found by the jury as an enhancement, that could be used to impose an upper term sentence."
2006.05-6551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,138.991,149.946,"Would it always, then, be surplusage in the indictment when a fact is charged and subsequently found by a jury, is it always a surplus fact?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,165.641,166.641,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,177.632,197.077,"If in this case, the indictment had charged... had claimed that the defendant was the father of the victim, would that have satisfied at least the fact-finding for the aggravator of being in a position of trust?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,197.077,208.468,"Well, Your Honor, the fact that the information would have alleged that does not mean that the jury would have found that fact, because just because... what is alleged in the indictment or in the information--"
2006.05-6551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,208.468,210.837,That depends on the instructions.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,210.837,211.537,--Yes.
2006.05-6551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,211.537,225.097,"If the instructions said, you know, you've got to find all of the things that are set out in the information, and the jury returned a verdict, then we would have found... and that would satisfy the requirement of an additional fact on an element."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,225.097,226.18,"I believe so, Justice Souter."
2006.05-6551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.18,229.399,"That would be an erroneous instruction, I assume."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,229.399,231.5,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-6551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.5,235.335,You either have to have an erroneous instruction or a special verdict.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,235.335,236.237,Yes.
2006.05-6551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,236.237,242.058,Only in the sense that it would require the state to prove more than it had to prove for the elements of the crime.
2006.05-6551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.058,242.491,Right.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,242.491,251.247,"Yes, Justice Souter, and I agree that it would be no different than submitting aggravating factors as a separate allegation to the jury as a separate instruction."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,251.247,258.5,"Counsel, the thing that concerns me about your case is that California's system looks a lot like the Federal system after Booker."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,312.385,319.141,"Well, Your Honor, this system really is... this is just like... this case is just like Blakely."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,362.918,365.67,"Under California, they're advisory anyway."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,373.693,374.559,"--Mr. Chief Justice, no."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,378.63,389.203,"My point is if he makes a finding that justifies going up to the higher term, 16 years in this case, he doesn't have to impose that higher term, he can go back to the middle term."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,389.203,390.671,"--No, no, you are absolutely right."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.856,407.866,But does it say that the only basis for a judge reasonably imposing the higher term is that the judge has found a fact that the jury didn't find.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,407.866,408.266,Yes.
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,408.266,408.966,It does say that?
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,417.388,422.642,"Your Honor, what this... what the California Supreme Court did, in this--"
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,422.642,434.533,"Maybe that's hard to justify in terms of California's statute, but we take the California Supreme Court's interpretation of that statute as the law of California."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,439.318,451.642,"--The answer to your question is that Black has made no change whatsoever to the mandatory nature of California's Determinate Sentencing Law, and it has always operated in a mandatory way."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,451.642,452.411,I think... let me give you--
2006.05-6551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.411,465.052,I think your answer would be that how could it possibly be reasonable except for the consideration of some additional fact?
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,469.571,474.408,"--If that is your answer, my example will be... I'll give you a specific example."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,523.008,523.573,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,523.573,524.091,What?
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,524.091,526.459,I believe that the statements in Black--
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.459,528.709,Which statements make that unlawful?
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,528.709,539.433,"--Your Honor, in Black, the California Supreme Court repeatedly stated that the way the system works in California is that it is a mandatory system."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,575.123,584.479,"So in other words, when they say mandatory factor, they mean aggravating factor, they mean to exclude the kind of aggravating factor I just mentioned."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,584.479,589.55,"--Well, a judge can consider those aggravating factors."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.55,590.2,"Oh, could he?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,600.091,600.741,"Well, Your Honor--"
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,600.741,601.841,Yes or no?
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,601.841,613.481,"--Well, under California's law, they have... in addition to factors relating to the crime and factors relating to the defendant, the judge can consider unenumerated factors."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,613.481,615.533,Unenumerated factors.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,618.319,618.752,Yes.
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,618.752,619.402,All right.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,648.303,655.225,"Your Honor, I'm not sure whether that sort of factor would be upheld as a--"
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.225,658.844,"But if it were reasonable, it would be upheld, or not?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,658.844,670.818,"--If it was found to be a decision that was reasonably related to the crime... I'm sorry, to the decision being made by the judge, then yes, it would be upheld as a valid aggravating factor."
2006.05-6551,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.257,680.724,May I clarify one thing?
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,686.744,691.732,"Your Honor, under California law, I'm not saying that that would be upheld as a valid reason."
2006.05-6551,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.548,695.886,"But there's nothing in California law suggesting that that would be upheld, is there?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,695.886,697.502,"--No, Justice Stevens, there is not."
2006.05-6551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,697.502,721.151,"So you draw... as I understand it, your basic answer to Justice Breyer is, it may well be that the situation in the community may justify a judge in going to the... to the high end of the range that is possible, but that is not a factor that determines what range is possible."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,729.057,730.307,"That's absolutely right, Justice Souter."
2006.05-6551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.307,731.559,--I didn't understand it.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,776.088,786.127,"Well, with all due respect to Justice Breyer, I believe that that probably would not be an aggravating factor that would be upheld under California law."
2006.05-6551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,799.603,804.238,I thought your position was that aggravation must be reasonable.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,818.329,820.515,--The position as far as what Black is saying?
2006.05-6551,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.515,820.915,Yes.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,820.915,821.548,Yes.
2006.05-6551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,829.554,843.046,"But I think that there's the further indication that it is not going to be deemed reasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact, as indicated in order to support one of the specific guideline aggravators."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,843.046,854.604,"--Certainly if the aggravating factor is not supported by the evidence, then it won't be considered reasonable and the imposition of a upper term won't be considered reasonable."
2006.05-6551,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,855.088,864.81,I still don't understand the distinction between the California system and a system of advisory guidelines with reasonableness appellate review.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,908.739,923.165,"--Your Honor, if you're describing the Federal system or just a hypothetical system, my understanding in a indeterminate type of system, a judge can impose whatever sentence he wants."
2006.05-6551,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,929.736,944.912,"But isn't it reviewed for reasonableness... isn't the reasonableness review necessarily going to require what is, in essence, fact-finding by the trial judge, and a review of the reasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by an appellate court?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,944.912,946.364,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,966.861,969.277,"Why is that, why is that so?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1017.127,1023.714,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that it's the mandatory nature in California of the middle term."
2006.05-6551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.707,1050.615,To say that a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1067.31,1069.31,"Yes, Your... Justice Scalia."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1083.752,1094.21,So the only part of the California system that creates a problem is this... the one sentence in the statute that says the judge shall impose the middle term unless he makes a finding.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1094.21,1095.027,That's absolutely right.
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1095.027,1111.672,"So that if we rule in your favor, the great benefit for criminal defendants in California will be that judges can now depart without making a particular finding, they can increase the sentence even though they do not find an aggravator within the limits of the California system."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1111.672,1115.791,"But Mr. Chief Justice, it is not clear that that would be the result in California."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1117.742,1122.527,Doesn't the decision in Black suggest the Supreme Court thinks that would be the result?
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1123.646,1128.031,--I'm not sure that they think that that would be the result.
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1136.121,1138.923,I thought that... it looked to me that's what they were trying to do in Black.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1170.377,1174.829,"Well, and that may very well be the case, but that's not what the California Supreme Court did in Black."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1188.339,1197.362,"But what they said was judges can impose a sentence in either of the three... any one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it for reasonableness."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1201.496,1208.935,"Yes, but once again, the reasonableness aspect is not what makes the system constitutional."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1221.743,1233.201,"Well, to be quite... to expose my thinking on it, I found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260 and 1261."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1312.903,1322.508,"Well, Your Honor, I have no doubt that the California Supreme Court was trying to fit the Determinate Sentencing Law within the constitutionality of this Court's Booker system."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.672,1347.743,An aggravating factor means aggravating fact.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1347.743,1350.945,"Aggravating fact, uh... yes."
2006.05-6551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1350.945,1362.835,"What would you think would be necessary, what would be the least change California would have to make to bring its system into compliance with our decisions?"
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1362.835,1377.262,"Justice Ginsburg, the court could... the court or the legislature could change section 1170(b) to read something like: ""A judge may impose"" instead of ""shall impose"" the middle term."
2006.05-6551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.118,1392.605,Or they could say the middle term will always be reasonable.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1393.905,1396.307,"They could, and in effect, they do say that--"
2006.05-6551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1396.307,1404.412,--Even though there is the possibility that something above the middle term would also be reasonable without necessarily finding a discrete fact beyond the indictment to justify it.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1404.862,1405.229,--Yes.
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.612,1413.852,"The protection that criminal defendants now have, that they cannot be sentenced to a higher term unless the judge makes particular findings, will then be no longer applicable."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1413.852,1415.304,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.187,1423.308,"That's true unless the California legislature does what most states have done in response to Booker, which is not that route at all."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1431.314,1432.13,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1442.121,1460.416,"So that now the defendant will have the protection of his jury determining his guilt, will not only have to know the evidence of his guilt of the crime, but also know why he's likely to re-offend in the future, things like he used a firearm, all the bad things that will increase his sentence and might affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the first place."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1460.416,1461.466,"--Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1479.811,1486.316,And are there a half a dozen jury trials in each... for each of those various aggravating factors that now have to be tried to the jury?
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1486.316,1490.135,"No, Your Honor, what I'm trying to say is that basically California does that anyway now."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1506.897,1507.63,That's interesting.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1519.038,1520.305,They don't have more than one jury.
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.924,1528.56,In what percentage would you say they have bifurcated or several jury trials?
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1529.893,1533.797,"--Your Honor, I would say that there are lots of cases where they're tried to a court."
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.749,1543.903,"No, no, but how many, how many times do they... let me call it impaneling the jury twice, or two juries, or it could be the same one."
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1543.903,1544.32,The same--
2006.05-6551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1544.32,1544.703,Yes.
2006.05-6551,0,37928,peter_gold,,1548.641,1551.176,"--Completely anecdotally, I would say 20 percent."
2006.05-6551,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1555.295,1558.847,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1563.234,1566.768,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.792,1604.478,That's not so at all.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1620.97,1626.157,"--Yes, Your Honor, but that's the same constraint that this Court found not above the Constitution in Booker."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.157,1627.926,"No, that's not what we found in Booker."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1664.182,1668.301,"Your Honor, I'd have to respectfully disagree with that because we're not talking about a middle range."
2006.05-6551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.201,1701.122,"But the difference is, in the Federal system, the judge can go above and it can be reasonable based on facts that were found by the jury."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1708.045,1709.045,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2006.05-6551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.045,1711.08,Is that not correct?
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1711.08,1717.151,--That's only correct because California has a discrete three-term sentence.
2006.05-6551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.151,1717.534,Correct.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1719.603,1729.874,"It is correct, Your Honor, but the central point of both Booker and California is that that upper term is being reversed not because it's unauthorized, but because it's unreasonable."
2006.05-6551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.874,1736.362,"On one hand, in one case, the unreasonableness depends on a finding of fact not made by the jury."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1740.532,1747.52,"Your Honor, if a Federal judge wished to impose a life term, there would have to be something to justify it, or it would be reversed on appeal."
2006.05-6551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1747.52,1750.538,It wouldn't necessarily be a fact.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1817.349,1826.205,"I would say you are wrong, Your Honor, simply because California has construed its sentencing law in 1170(b) as imposing nothing more than a reasonableness--"
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1826.205,1841.048,"No, but if... as I understand it, it has construed it by saying that if you go above the middle term without a discrete finding of fact beyond what has to be proven to the jury, it is unreasonable as a matter of law."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1847.286,1857.641,"--Well, Your Honor, I would disagree, because the upper term, the statutory maximum in Booker would also be necessarily unreasonable if there was no justification offered by the trial court--"
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.641,1868.449,"But the justification under the Federal system could be, you know, this is what the sentencing commission thought was a reasonable sentence for this crime."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1901.003,1902.538,"--I have two responses to that, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1941.08,1947.067,But that does not necessarily mean that he must make a discrete finding of fact in order to do it.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,1973.1,1977.17,"Well, Your Honor, the systems converge at the end point."
2006.05-6551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2001.536,2010.242,"And they can't be a fact... in California, it can't be a fact found by the jury, as Justice Stevens pointed out."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2013.426,2014.961,"Well, it can't be an element."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.679,2044.898,It isn't the same in the Federal guidelines.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2082.154,2083.406,"--Yes, it could, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2107.721,2127.652,"Are you saying to us that under the California system, if a California judge went through exactly the thought process that Justice Scalia just outlined and put that down on paper, without finding any discrete fact beyond the elements the jury found, that he could go to the third tier?"
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2134.856,2138.424,"Yes, Your Honor, deterrence is a basis for going to the third tier."
2006.05-6551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.424,2142.728,"Well, that's critical, and that's what I didn't understand about--"
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.728,2143.828,"Well, it's not true."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2171.914,2174.2,"Well, that's part of the rules of court under 4.410."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.716,2175.182,Where--
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2175.182,2175.933,That would be--
2006.05-6551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.933,2179.684,--It's appendix page 3 in the brief.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2179.684,2180.569,--Page 2 and 3.
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.569,2184.821,I'm not sure that that's the way the Black court interpreted it.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2194.094,2199.665,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be considered an aggravating factor, to use deterrence for this particular case--"
2006.05-6551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.665,2201.85,What do I do here?
2006.05-6551,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2283.421,2288.206,"I'm sorry, before you... could you tell me where the court rule you're talking about is set out?"
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2288.206,2294.793,"--It's in our appendix, page... the appendix to our brief, I'm sorry, the appendix to our brief, page 2 and 3."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2294.793,2317.975,"--You say in your brief, which doesn't seem to me to comport with what you are saying here, for a judge to exceed the base range, for example, by applying enhancement or an alternative sentencing scheme, the predicate fact for the enhancement or alternative scheme must be pleaded and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2328.116,2331.402,"Your Honor, that's to exceed the base range, to go beyond the three terms."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2338.306,2338.672,All right.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2369.027,2383.101,"Well, Your Honor, I think the rules of court are viewed as a whole with 4.408, which talks about anything in addition to... that the rules of... the examples set out are not exclusive and not determinant, that anything can be a consideration."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.101,2385.62,"Well, but they have to be an aggravating factor."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2385.62,2386.503,Yes.
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.503,2393.558,"And to talk about the need for more deterrence as an aggravating factor, that's not an aggravating factor."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2393.558,2400.962,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the example that was given was in relation to the community that was experiencing some uptick in crime."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.962,2402.164,That's not an aggravating factor.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2412.77,2425.363,"Well, Your Honor, the importance of our position, the central thrust of our position is that the reasonableness constraint, the constraint imposed under 1170(b) has been interpreted as a reasonableness constraint."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2427.214,2436.135,"Well, it can be a reasonableness constraint and also be a reasonableness restraint that requires a finding of discrete facts for reasonableness."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2438.004,2440.456,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2441.039,2447.11,And the rule seems to conflate... seems very clearly to conflate the finding of a discrete fact.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2466.523,2487.104,"Well, let me explain it this way, Your Honor, that it doesn't matter from our perspective whether or not there is a factor required in order to say that something is... that the end point is reasonable, or if you are taking deterrence into account, that that's not... it's not necessary for our argument because our position is that even if a factor is required--"
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2487.104,2508.617,"So do you think under subsection (b) of Rule 4.420, if a judge said, I just think the policy of deterrence requires something heavier, you think that statement by the judge would satisfy the requirement that circumstances in aggravation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence?"
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2508.617,2510.35,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2510.719,2511.069,All right.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2517.473,2523.043,"Well, Your Honor, I would refer back to Black at 1255, which is the important part."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2523.043,2525.243,Is Black repealing the rule of court?
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2535.684,2536.134,Yes.
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2536.134,2547.758,"Under the court rule, you admit that a judge's policy consideration, however sincerely held, could not satisfy the requirement to prove aggravation by a preponderance."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2554.712,2563.018,"Well, no, Your Honor, but California has construed 1170(b) as not requiring a fact-finding to move from the middle term to the upper term."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2566.787,2568.822,Then why didn't you give a different answer to my question?
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2582.331,2592.604,"Well, Your Honor, I think that my answer would have to be that in relation to the hypothetical given, I was answering it because... with regards to the circumstances of the community that the defendant committed the crime in."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2593.723,2594.156,Okay.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2620.956,2623.825,"--Yes, I believe it would."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2623.825,2629.443,"That would satisfy the requirement of, as it puts it, establishing by a--"
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2631.229,2633.145,Uh-huh.
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.445,2638.883,That was not what I understood California law to be or your position to be until this moment.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2638.883,2645.453,"Well, Your Honor, I have not been suggesting that that single factor is what makes California's law constitutional."
2006.05-6551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2654.944,2659.229,Reasonably... that does not answer the problem.
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.229,2667.918,I think the California Supreme Court and the California legislature would be astounded to think that this is what they have wrought.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2703.525,2721.386,"Your Honor, let me take a step back then and say that, even with the requirement that there be some factor, putting aside deterrence as a possibility, California's system as structured, which only requires a reasonableness constraint, does not violate the Constitution."
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2736.146,2739.014,That's the whole problem with your case.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2739.014,2739.864,Certainly.
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2739.864,2748.287,"That there's... and incidentally, under the rules, under 4.410, those are general objectives of sentencing."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2748.287,2748.887,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2748.887,2752.524,And that is a term of art that's different from circumstances.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2752.524,2752.991,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2752.991,2757.076,So it's only the circumstances that have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2759.777,2760.611,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2760.611,2779.008,"But what we are involved with in this case and with this criminal, whose conviction and sentence we're reviewing here, are circumstances that aggravate, and these do require findings."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2779.008,2779.508,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2779.508,2781.96,"If those findings aren't there, it's not reasonable."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2781.96,2783.343,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.197,2824.085,"So what we have... now, this has clarified it, but I don't know what to do."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2908.172,2916.845,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the one thing that seems to be giving you some difficulty is the fact that California didn't explicitly say in Black, we are now officially Bookerizing our system."
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2945.713,2947.763,"Well, it is the same old record we've been playing."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2966.724,2967.491,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2967.491,2970.776,But the objectives of sentencing are not what's involved in this case.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,2970.776,2972.711,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.195,3029.214,"Would you want us to hold that, you know, that we uphold the system here in an opinion that says what California's sentencing judges may do under California law, as you've described it to us, is that they... they may exceed the middle range whenever they think that that is a better result, whenever they think that that's reasonable?"
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3029.214,3029.647,Yes.
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.647,3032.833,And you think California would be happy with that?
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3032.833,3033.249,Yes.
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.355,3051.545,"Well, including reasonable disagreement with the level of severity that the legislature has provided in the middle term."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3066.32,3067.306,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3067.306,3068.272,That isn't reasonable?
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3069.958,3071.541,Reasonableness has to be tied to--
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3073.493,3074.643,He ties it to that.
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3092.471,3093.99,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-6551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.99,3097.525,Then you don't mean reasonableness.
2006.05-6551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3098.342,3100.644,May I ask you this question?
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3118.738,3122.24,--I would say probably a rough guess would be around 10 percent.
2006.05-6551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.676,3139.702,"On that question, may I ask... on that subject, may I ask you this question: Have you read the brief filed by the National Association... the amicus brief by the National Association of Defense Lawyers, which has a long discussion of the practical consequences in other states and in California?"
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3139.702,3140.069,--Yes.
2006.05-6551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.069,3146.458,"And which I find, to be honest to you, rather persuasive on the fact it's not such a big deal as we thought it might be."
2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3152.611,3155.647,"Well, Your Honor, it would certainly be a big deal to California."
2006.05-6551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3169.471,3179.846,"They say, if I remember it correctly, that if the impact in a four day trial would normally be an extra hour for the jury, that that's about the burden on the system."

2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3235.599,3243.436,It's my understanding that under... currently in California about 20 percent of the prison population has an upper term.

2006.05-6551,1,31597,jeffrey_mk_laurence,,3315.051,3316.701,"No, Your Honor, I'm not aware of it."
