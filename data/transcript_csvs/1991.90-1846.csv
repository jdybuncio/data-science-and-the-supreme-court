1991.90-1846,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.838,"We'll hear argument now on No. 90-1846, George F. Denton, Director of Corrections of California v. Mike Hernandez."
1991.90-1846,0,29785,james_ching,,13.411,16.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1846,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,44.211,46.124,We didn't hear oral argument--
1991.90-1846,0,29785,james_ching,,46.124,46.532,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1846,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,46.532,47.623,--We just held the case for Neitzke.
1991.90-1846,0,29785,james_ching,,47.623,48.154,Yes.
1991.90-1846,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.662,112.636,"Are you going to explain in a little more detail what is the exclusive judicial notice rule that you're referring to, Mr. Ching?"
1991.90-1846,0,29785,james_ching,,112.636,113.237,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1846,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.955,272.283,"Well, Mr. Ching, do you take the view that the trial judge is to determine the credibility of the allegations made in a complaint, the factual allegations made, or do you take the position that the trial court should just determine what rational inferences can be drawn from the facts that are alleged?"
1991.90-1846,0,29785,james_ching,,272.283,288.795,"The use of the term credibility I believe is an unfortunate one, my point being that there is no evaluation of a witness' testimony made within the four corners of the five complaints."
1991.90-1846,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.795,316.494,"I mean, it would seem to me that in... looking at the complaints here that perhaps it could be said that no rational inference of rapes could be made from the facts that were alleged with the exception, of course, of the affidavits submitted by Armando Esquer."
1991.90-1846,0,29785,james_ching,,324.932,330.455,I agree with you as to the evaluation that must be made of the unsupported allegations.
1991.90-1846,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.191,354.661,"Well, as to that do you think in the face of the affidavit of Armando Esquer, that as to that complaint which is one of the five, that it can be dismissed--"
1991.90-1846,0,29785,james_ching,,354.661,355.833,"--Your Honor, I would say--"
1991.90-1846,1,40086,richard_w_nichols,,822.67,831.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.325,942.74,"Doesn't arguable almost, you think of it as an adjective used to modify something dealing with law rather than facts."
1991.90-1846,1,40086,richard_w_nichols,,942.74,959.962,"Certainly that is the sense in which it is most frequently used, but the Court's definition of the standard in Neitzke applied the same definition, arguable basis, to both law and fact."
1991.90-1846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.568,994.917,Are you inserting a whole layer of some sort of determination different from a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment?
1991.90-1846,1,40086,richard_w_nichols,,994.917,1007.404,"It's essentially, essentially akin to a motion for summary judgment procedure, although not necessarily having to be brought by motion."
1991.90-1846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.082,1061.341,"And yet Neitzke certainly allows the district court or the magistrate, whoever is the initial determiner, to probe beyond the surface allegations."
1991.90-1846,1,40086,richard_w_nichols,,1070.367,1072.099,"Absolutely, and--"
1991.90-1846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.099,1081.135,"So what more can the district court do, in your view, than it can do on a motion to dismiss, which is virtually nothing so far as well pleaded facts?"
1991.90-1846,1,40086,richard_w_nichols,,1081.135,1129.167,"--Well, the district court can require a number of, impose a number of procedural requirements to require the plaintiff to get away from pleading conclusions and plead evidentiary material, heightened facts, so that the district court can determine, prior to the plaintiff coming in for an evidentiary credibility determination, whether the pleadings with those items of evidence would be sufficient to enable a rational fact-finder to conclude that there was something worth proceeding on to the credibility point."
1991.90-1846,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1129.167,1138.883,"The rule, the section as written contemplates some dismissals without further leave to amend or anything else, don't you think?"
1991.90-1846,1,40086,richard_w_nichols,,1138.883,1144.208,It certainly contemplates dismissals without leave to amend.
1991.90-1846,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1167.685,1173.96,"Well, Mr. Nichols, some of the allegations here may fall in that category, I would suggest."
1991.90-1846,1,40086,richard_w_nichols,,1173.96,1190.481,"Well, some of them... I will certainly admit, Justice O'Connor, that quite a number of them fail to survive a 12(b)(6) test at this point, and it may be on amendment--"
1991.90-1846,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1190.481,1197.668,"Well, they may fail to allow a rational inference to be drawn as to some of them."
1991.90-1846,1,40086,richard_w_nichols,,1197.668,1210.017,"--Well, Mr. Hernandez has never been given an opportunity to amend in respond, in response to the Ninth Circuit's view of what he ought to be able to do."
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2613.302,2638.347,"Your Honor, I would suggest that the Court was correct in stating that there has been an accretion of miscellaneous procedures, all of them unauthorized by law, such as the Spears and Martinez reports, such as holding these complaints in some file, such as requiring or in fact encouraging fact pleading rather than notice pleading in these instances."
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.891,2687.003,"May I ask you, Mr. Ching, what your understanding of the Ninth Circuit rule is?"
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2696.19,2696.761,Yes.
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.785,2705.186,Right.
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2720.656,2723.37,I believe I must disagree with that.
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2734.079,2734.299,What is it?
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2734.299,2747.679,"Well, it states that there is permissive and mandatory judicial notice available of such facts in a general group that are beyond question, statutes of the United States--"
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.679,2751.001,Which negate the allegations of the complaint?
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2751.442,2752.163,--Yes.
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.281,2768.424,"What do you suppose we meant when we referred... that comes out of Neitzke, I think, the fantastic or delusional scenarios."
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2770.054,2774.057,--I think the Court did in fact mean Mars.
1991.90-1846,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.169,2776.229,We didn't mean judicial notice though?
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2776.229,2777.871,"--You certainly did not, Your Honor."
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.489,2797.714,"But what is it, maybe I miss it in the Ninth Circuit, what is it in the Ninth Circuit opinion that tells us that even in the kind, the martian type delusional case they are not going to dismiss?"
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2803.45,2807.884,"Well, I must say I find it very difficult to understand it as well."
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.884,2816.829,"I thought what they said was that there are allegations here that have some factual support, and there is enough factual support that we'll send them back and have the district judge take a look at them."
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2816.829,2817.45,Exactly.
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2822.603,2823.744,"They don't use that term, do they?"
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2823.744,2825.295,"--Yes, they do."
1991.90-1846,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.295,2826.066,Do they?
1991.90-1846,2,29785,james_ching,,2826.066,2827.105,In both opinions.
