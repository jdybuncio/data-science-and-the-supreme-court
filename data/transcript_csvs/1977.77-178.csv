1977.77-178,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.295,We will hear arguments next in Robertson against Wegmann.
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,30.019,36.463,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-178,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,120.011,125.356,Is that because of the nature of the action or does that apply across the board to any?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,125.356,134.245,There is a distinction in the Louisiana law of survivorship between actions for damage to property as opposed to personal actions.
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.631,298.501,Were all the defendants still living?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,298.501,300.965,"All of the defendants are still living, yes, sir."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,300.965,303.517,Is Mr. Garrison still the prosecutor?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,303.517,304.78,"No sir, he is not."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.402,316.501,He was the only state agent was he not?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,316.501,325.304,"There is one other friend alleged to be a member of his staff, Dr. Fadda, yes, sir."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,325.304,326.793,But your client is a private citizen?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,326.793,327.519,"That is correct, sir."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.519,328.786,He is and was?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,328.786,332.085,That is correct sir.
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.206,685.195,"Suppose some state has not modified the Common Law at all, then that is the end of the matter I think?"
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,685.195,689.562,"Mr. Justice White, we would submit so."
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.562,697.759,And that the Common Law Rule just could not possibly violate this one proviso you just spoke of?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,697.759,713.059,We submit sir that under the direct dictate of Congress in 1988 that that law of the state would have to be applied since the law is entirely silent as to survivorship.
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.36,721.844,"The only common law the statute refers to is state common law, right?"
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,721.844,723.565,I would say so sir.
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.565,739.434,"And although I suppose that if the state by a judicial decision changed the common law, it would be acceptable?"
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,739.434,741.401,That is an interesting…
1977.77-178,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,741.401,744.753,Do you have a state common law in Louisiana?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,744.753,745.516,"No, sir."
1977.77-178,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,745.516,748.575,I did not think so.
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.575,757.184,So in Louisiana would you say that only the common law rule could apply?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,757.184,766.69,"No, sir as I think you would look to the law of the state as enacted by the Constitution and statutes of that state sir."
1977.77-178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.69,776.831,"Yes, but my Brother White’s question was what if it is not changed by Constitutional statute, but by judicial decision of Louisiana, then what do you do?"
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,776.831,789.03,"I would say sir that if that were the rule in Louisiana, I would think that under 1988, it would have to be applied."
1977.77-178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,789.03,792.56,"Well, now which, the judicial decision or the, is that it?"
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,792.56,793.55,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.55,796.546,"The law of Louisiana, however and by whom that were declared?"
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,796.546,798.202,"That is correct, sir."
1977.77-178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,798.202,801.73,But that is not what the statute says?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,801.73,802.13,I believe so.
1977.77-178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,802.13,810.59,What it says is as modified and changed by the Constitution and statutes of the state wherein the Court having jurisdiction is held?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,810.59,829.171,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I would assume of course that we would have the situation say in this case that for whatever reason, the Supreme Court of Louisiana would reach a different interpretation of the Civil Code Article 2315 and has been the case today."
1977.77-178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,845.074,847.6,The statutory changed for purposes of 1983?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,847.6,848.641,I would say so sir.
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.641,852.246,That would be the statute as construed by the highest Court of the state.
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,852.246,853.342,"Precisely, sir."
1977.77-178,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,853.342,859.357,Otherwise you would have one rule in Louisiana and another rule for the other 49 states I presume?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,859.357,862.13,I think that is quite possible and I think that is true.
1977.77-178,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.923,921.494,My question was directed more to this difference between the Civil Law which I understand pertinent in Louisiana and to depend entirely on code provision and the other 49 states which have more or less of common law and ascendance and the idea of the seamless web where there is no statute to common law presumably governed?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,921.494,923.416,"Yes, I understand sir."
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.176,984.531,Do you think it would be wholly inappropriate to absent 1988 to construe that the statute as providing for survivorship?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,984.531,1015.17,"Absent 1988, Mr. Justice White, I think you would bring into play those doctrines which Amicus discussed at considerable length in its brief about the Rules of Decision Act and the choice of law which of course is being debated all the time and it is causing this Court and other Federal Courts considerable problem as to the choice of law and what law to apply."
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.669,1045.781,"Of course, 1988 does not speak specifically of survivorship, does it?"
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1045.781,1050.862,"No sir, all gaps and I think Congress was being all encompassing."
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.862,1065.487,Do we have to look for example to state law to determine the question of immunity of government officials under 1983?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1065.487,1073.234,"1983, the question of immunity again, I think might be analogized…"
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1073.234,1075.523,It is not mentioned in 1983?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1075.523,1083.357,"No, sir, it is not, but I think it maybe analogized to my point about recoverable damages."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.876,1094.794,And that is Federal Law.
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1094.794,1104.969,"Yes, sir, Federal Law, so therefore, you do not have a void or a gap in the Federal Law, would be my position."
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.969,1108.684,It is time to read that in 1983?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1108.684,1113.408,"Yes, sir, I think you can sir, Mr. Justice White because the premise of 1983…"
1977.77-178,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.408,1117.44,So there are some things that you misconstrue into a statute.
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1117.44,1130.233,"No, 1983 starts off by saying in effect that when it commands the Courts to apply its jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Act in accordance with the Federal Law."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1130.233,1140.659,"It says laws and you think that includes, laws generally connotes written statutes and do you think laws means and includes --"
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1140.659,1147.811,"It has been interpreted by this Court, I think in immunity cases as I recall."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1147.811,1149.5,I do not know if there was --
1977.77-178,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1149.5,1154.75,I thought we have just said that the immunity under 1983 was a matter of construing 1983?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1161.614,1169.226,"Well, it could be approached from the matter of construction of the statute."
1977.77-178,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.568,1180.877,Pierson v. Ray did not refer to 1988 at all?
1977.77-178,0,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,1180.877,1182.06,"No, sir."
1977.77-178,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1668.338,1673.399,Mr. Wegmann.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1673.399,1677.496,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.49,1781.162,"Well, then you are not arguing based on 1988 because I do not see anything in there about trend or hospitable or that type of language?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1781.162,1786.331,I do not think I have any doubt but to argue on the basis of 1988.
1977.77-178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1786.331,1812.249,"Well, I thought that in 1988 if you look at your own brief on page 6, the language of the statute that it says in effect, the Common Law as modified and changed by the Constitution, statutes of the state wherein the Court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is held so far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution laws of the United States shall be applied."
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1820.664,1830.927,"Yes, sir, I agree with that and this is exactly what Judge Wisdom of the 5th Circuit did in affirming the decision of the Trial Court."
1977.77-178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.927,1833.758,That maybe a matter of opinion as to whether he did it or not.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1835.801,1838.329,I would do it exactly in the same fashion.
1977.77-178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.329,1840.713,That it is inconsistent with 1983?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1840.713,1859.487,"Yes, sir, because you will find that all of the Circuits which have considered this question have applied the state law solely and only because that State Law was hospitable to the action and allowed the action to continue."
1977.77-178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.835,1881.842,How about applying statute of limitations?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1881.842,1882.952,We had one instance.
1977.77-178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.0,1908.138,"But you have had other case in which more normal statutes of limitations have been applied, have you not?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1908.138,1914.729,"The more normal statutes of limitation would be one, two and perhaps four years and they do vary from state to state."
1977.77-178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.729,1916.503,And have those not been applied under 1988?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1916.503,1920.826,But we do not here have a question of the statute of limitations.
1977.77-178,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.216,1931.136,Why is survival different than statute of limitations if you are going to turn you argument on 1988?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1931.136,1940.209,"Well, the statute of limitations does not have to end to this case because this case was filed before Shaw died."
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1944.499,1957.349,"Mr. Wegmann, getting back to the other one, had there been familial descendants, the Louisiana statute would not have been inhospitable, would it?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1957.349,1958.678,"No, sir, it would not."
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1958.678,1964.696,So you are saying the statute is inhospitable because of the facts of a particular case?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1964.696,1967.372,"Yes, we can say that."
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.893,1980.592,The statute did not prevent him from getting married and did not prevent him from leaving the heirs?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1980.592,1983.132,"No, sir, I did not say that it is."
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1983.132,1991.401,I mean the statute is inhospitable to use your language solely because there were no heirs.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,1991.401,1992.423,There were heirs.
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.45,2004.094,"Well, you do not understand what I am talking about and that is the reason…"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2004.094,2006.996,He did have a family. He did have some collaterals.
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2010.906,2015.771,So the reason the statute is in trouble is because of him?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2015.771,2017.301,If I might finish sir.
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2027.846,2029.353,"Well, that is not before us, is it?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2029.353,2031.981,"No, sir but you are asking me about…"
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.981,2041.705,"All I am saying is you are saying because of a peculiar fact of this case, this statute is unconstitutional?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2041.705,2043.209,I do not say that the statute is unconstitutional.
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.209,2045.788,"Well, what do you say?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2048.051,2050.846,I say it does not bar me from continuing.
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.846,2058.899,And if it does not bar you then by what do you continue?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2058.899,2134.698,"I continue because wearing my hat as executor of Clay Shaw’s succession, I have been allowed by the Trial Court to substitute myself as a plaintiff in this damage suit and the Trial Court in a very well reasoned opinion affirmed by a second well reasoned opinion with no emotion in it despite the remarks of petitioner to that effect has held that because the Article 2315 of the Louisiana Code is inhospitable to the application of state law that it does not apply and we bring into play the Federal Common Law which Mr. Justice Stewart spoke of and the Appellate Court in its opinion made the direct pronouncement to the effect that the Federal Common Law is alive and well and it is the Federal Common Law which was applied both by the Trial Court as well as by the Appellate Court."
1977.77-178,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2134.698,2144.832,"On your theory, if he had left his entire estate to Ford Foundation, let us say, your legal position would be the same, would it not?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2144.832,2146.325,"Yes, sir, it would."
1977.77-178,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2146.325,2164.573,"But are not survivorship concepts generally, although not strictly and literally, but generally based on some traceable connection between the decedent and the survivor."
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2169.424,2185.648,"There have been six statutes as a rule for the protection and the taking care of the descendants or the dependents of the individuals who may have been injured or killed by virtue of negligence of some third party, ordinarily that is the case."
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.162,2237.491,"Mr. Wegmann, following up on the Chief Justice’s question, supposing he left the will he did leave and had also been survived by a son and in his will he said I do not want my son to have any benefit from my estate."
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2241.156,2259.956,"Well, your hypothetical is a little difficult to answer, Mr. Justice Stevens because of the fact in Louisiana, we have what is known as the Law of Forced Heirship and I can only disinherit my descendants for these specific reasons which are enunciated in the code."
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.956,2260.89,Let us say you had those reasons available.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2260.89,2265.496,In succession procedure and it is next to impossible.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.496,2267.376,"It is theoretically possible, is it not?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2267.376,2269.342,"Theoretical yes, from a practical standpoint, no."
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2269.342,2278.834,"Which law would prevail, the Federal Common Law that I take it you say gives the right to the estate or the Louisiana statute that says it goes to the son?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2279.919,2281.398,I do not know that I understand your question.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.779,2299.589,"Or he maybe just said in the will, I want this cause of action to be prosecuted by my estate, not for the benefit of my son, but for the benefit of my collateral heirs and under Federal Common Law, would that wish prevail?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2299.589,2300.328,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.328,2306.086,"Even though under Louisiana law, there was a son available who could claim under 1988?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2306.086,2314.41,Assuming that he did comply with the requirements of the code and the disinheritance of a son.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.894,2343.168,"The reason I asked you a question, maybe that is improbable hypothetical, but if we accept your theory of the case and there are I suppose, there will be possibilities of conflict between the Federal rule as to who should get the surviving cause of action and the state law."
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2350.404,2361.848,"Yes, because he died testate and using your hypothesis, he said I want this claim to be processed by my executive for the benefit of my residuary legatee."
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2361.848,2374.665,"And there is some kind of a federal basis for our doing this, for giving preference to the estate over the person of the Louisiana statute says should have the case?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2374.665,2378.867,I think we are on a tangent because we are dealing…
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.867,2384.835,I am just trying to figure out what kind of questions are around the corner if we accept your theory of the case.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2389.42,2391.92,I am quite aware of that.
1977.77-178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.92,2397.82,Does your theory of Forced Heirship apply where only a parent survives and the siblings?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2397.82,2405.67,"Yes, sir, if the ascendant is a forced heir."
1977.77-178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.67,2411.284,And the sibling also if there is only a brother?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2412.654,2416.46,"Collaterals are not forced heirs, no."
1977.77-178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.72,2425.29,Suppose then a sibling survived.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2425.29,2432.419,Forced heir?
1977.77-178,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2432.419,2436.639,What do you call an administrator of the will and in Louisiana it is a funny name?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2436.639,2438.258,We call it a succession.
1977.77-178,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2465.634,2477.375,"Mr. Wegmann, the Chief Justice asked you whether the opposition would be the same if the estate had been left to the Ford Foundation and your answer was in the affirmative."
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2483.317,2484.665,I am afraid it would have been.
1977.77-178,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2486.8,2487.77,I think it would have to be.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2487.77,2491.097,"Yes, sir I have to be consistent."
1977.77-178,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2498.235,2500.297,It would not precisely be compatible…
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2500.297,2504.113,It would make it even worse Mr. Justice Powell.
1977.77-178,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2526.455,2530.739,"Probably the plaintiff would have dismissed the lawsuit though, is it the end?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2530.739,2533.47,I am afraid so this plaintiff would have.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.47,2537.784,"Mr. Wegmann, let me go back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist question about statutes and limitations."
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2549.555,2580.849,I was asked that question repeatedly in the Circuit Court when I argued this case and one of the justices could not just simply could not believe what my response was because I think it is just that simple and it is simple proposition as stated by Professor Theus in this Louisiana law review article which I cited to you that if a State Law allows the action to survive it is hospitable and the State Law is applicable.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.822,2591.699,But would you respond in terms of the statute limitations.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2612.85,2614.178,I am sure you would.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.178,2621.093,"You would look it, but why do we look the State Law and in limitation situations, but not in abatement situations that is what I do not understand?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2621.093,2650.156,"I can only give you what I have read of the cases and apparently the reasoning is that where the Statute of Limitations of the State is for a reasonable period of time, in Louisiana it is one year, in Mississippi I believe it is two years as I recall over in Georgia it is four years, it is quite simple, it construes these to be reasonable periods of time."
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.156,2663.253,"Well, then why do we not apply the same test in abatement and say is the State Statute dealing with survivorship a reasonable Statute, if it something that says no Civil Rights action shall ever survive why we obviously would not look to it."
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2663.253,2689.007,I think I could best give you the Appellate Court’s reasoning in that regard and that was Judge Wisdom established a three-step procedure which he said we should follow.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.906,2754.557,"Well, is it not the same reasoning applicable to my four-year Statute Limitation, precisely?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2754.557,2763.264,As I say I can only refer you to the left in case in which the Statute of Limitations was 10 days and the Court said that it was unreasonable.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.264,2764.387,It has to be reasonable.
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2765.998,2768.857,I am injecting the reasonable in there.
1977.77-178,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.857,2773.872,But why does not your argument also say we want to apply a four-year statute limitation?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2778.375,2786.56,Because the Courts have said that we want these Civil Rights claim to go forward.
1977.77-178,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.881,2980.077,"Even if we accept all that it is totally true, it does not really reach the fundamental question in this case, does it?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,2980.077,3009.983,"Yes, sir it reaches it for the reason and that the intent of Congress and the intent of the Courts is to prevent people like Garrison for misusing his public office, to stop conduct which is more similar to what we might term a Police State than a democracy and to protect those rights to the fullest extent even after the death of the plaintiff."
1977.77-178,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3009.983,3014.41,"The voters of Louisiana have done something about that already, have they not?"
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,3014.41,3032.342,Fortunately they are going to have an opportunity to do something about it again because now he is running for the bench and God willing he will be defeated as he was last time he ran for the bench.
1977.77-178,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.067,3141.991,And this Court of Appeals is the only one to have applied that second doctrine?
1977.77-178,1,23430,edward_f_wegmann,,3141.991,3144.349,"So far as I know, yes sir."
1977.77-178,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3165.455,3167.3,Do you have anything further Mr. Monroe?
1977.77-178,2,36304,malcolm_w_monroe,,3167.3,3169.553,We submit the matter and if it please the Court?
1977.77-178,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3169.553,3170.72,Thank you gentlemen.
