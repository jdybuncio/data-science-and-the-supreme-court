1975.74-532,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.736,We will hear arguments next in McKinney against Alabama.
1975.74-532,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,38.795,41.516,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1510.998,1514.349,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-532,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1588.051,1596.929,"Are you suggesting that he had the opportunity to litigate it and he not only avoided it, but insisted on avoiding it?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1596.929,1599.779,"Yes sir, frankly."
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1601.446,1610.779,(Inaudible) You got to decide whether it is obscene as to the constitution requirement.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1612.235,1612.798,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1612.798,1614.579,It was the basis of his objection.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1620.87,1626.209,"No Sir, I believe his objection was that the question of obscenity was simply not for the jury in this case."
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1677.137,1680.741,But the judge says specifically the jury could not do that?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1680.741,1681.435,That is right sir.
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1684.956,1686.324,That is what they told the jury --
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1686.324,1687.367,He told the jury –-
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.367,1689.276,This is no question for the jury?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1689.276,1692.026,That was in response though to Mr. McKinney’s objection.
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1697.074,1700.07,He was going to charge him with volunteer something or risk of something?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1700.07,1700.553,"Pardon Sir, I did not --"
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1700.553,1703.998,Are you not going to charge him with volunteer something or risk or something?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1706.265,1707.187,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1710.274,1712.955,"But he did not want that rule, did he?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1712.955,1716.653,"Well he objected and when the judge said this is what I will do, he did not object it --"
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.653,1721.059,Because he wanted to go into the factual point of obscenity.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1721.059,1722.805,I do not read the record that way Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1722.805,1724.25,Well that is the way the judge ruled.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1734.489,1739.394,In response to Mr. McKinney’s objection that obscenity was not for the jury.
1975.74-532,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1747.675,1748.365,Mr. Marston.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1748.365,1750.232,Yes sir
1975.74-532,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1750.232,1761.783,"I do not want to prolong discussion as to what the language means, but the first full paragraph on A81 which contains the objection by the counsel."
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1783.736,1790.026,"Yes, I think that was his objection that the question of obscenity was not for this jury."
1975.74-532,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1791.374,1800.797,"Only if the course, the judge refused to allow any evidence as to whether or not the magazine was obscene because the judge took the position of that already had been determined."
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1800.797,1801.431,Yes.
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1916.336,1923.502,What would be the basis be obscene in Mobile and not obscene in Birmingham?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1923.502,1928.763,"Yes sir, if the community involved is the county."
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1937.221,1939.506,(Inaudible)
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1939.506,1941.334,Excuse me.
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1941.334,1950.158,Whose the element for the purposes of constitutional jurisprudence finally decided what can it do?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1950.158,1952.954,The Alabama Supreme Court in case of --
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1952.954,1955.039,You mean with the court --
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,1955.039,1964.429,"Oh! Well, Your Honor, this honorable Court has held in Hamling and in Miller and other cases that the state made use of state standard or a smaller standard."
1975.74-532,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2079.888,2087.373,Absent objection from Smith would the issue of obscenity been submitted to the jury?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2087.373,2088.09,Not to the jury.
1975.74-532,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.927,2104.658,"Well, I get the impression that you were suggesting Mr. Smith had some responsibility for keeping this issue away from the jury."
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2104.658,2106.347,"Well, not Mr. Smith, but Mr. McKinney’s counsel."
1975.74-532,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2106.347,2108.854,(Inaudible)
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2108.854,2109.591,I think it was.
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.104,2132.676,"I can understand that, say the obscenity issue was in this proceeding."
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2151.05,2153.015,I would –- Let me say this sir --
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.015,2155.863,That certainly that does not seem to what the statute is talking about?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2155.863,2158.742,"Well, let me say this."
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.838,2182.38,You are urging us to accept that as a construction of the Alabama Statute?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2182.38,2183.947,"No sir, not necessarily."
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.252,2188.008,"Well, are you or are you not, I mean, we ought to judge the case on one basis or the other?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2188.008,2193.921,"I believe under this statute he could have re-opened it in another, his own civil proceeding."
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2193.921,2217.796,"Are you suggesting then that if it had been Carnal Knowledge that was involved in this civil proceeding in Mobile and had there been held that Carnal Knowledge was obscene and then Carnal Knowledge was shown in Birmingham, that in that instance the defendant would not be foreclosed in challenging the obscenity of Carnal Knowledge?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2217.796,2218.646,Let me say this sir.
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2288.548,2290.091,Would you answer my question?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2290.091,2290.903,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2293.662,2307.432,"That Carnal Knowledge had been declared obscene in Mobile and this constitution holding against exhibitor of Carnal Knowledge in Birmingham, would or would not the exhibitor have a defense that the Carnal Knowledge is not obscene?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2307.432,2309.334,It is simply not obscene.
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2314.953,2317.59,But in any time of your proceeding your answer is yes.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2320.998,2322.735,Either that or a declaratory judgment is.
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2323.389,2329.588,"I know, but my question is, could you need criminal proceeding, and as I understand you the answer is yes?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2329.588,2338.554,The answer is I am not sure because of the contempt overtones of this particular corpus delicti.
1975.74-532,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.554,2341.743,But how do you have contempt by overtones?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2342.101,2348.579,"Well, disregard of a judicial order having knowledge of it."
1975.74-532,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2348.579,2351.137,"But it was a judicial order here in Mobile, was it not?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2351.137,2352.172,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2352.172,2352.887,And how is he?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2352.887,2355.25,"He was not, he could not be held in contempt."
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2397.76,2402.282,Disregarding an order to which he was not a party?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2402.282,2403.987,"Well, it was an interim proceeding."
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2407.392,2409.457,"Well, he was prosecuted for selling something?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2409.457,2409.819,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2409.819,2411.693,Is that a interim proceeding?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2411.693,2420.845,"No sir, that is a criminal proceeding, but he was prosecuted for selling something, the status of which had been determined in a judicial proceeding."
1975.74-532,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2420.845,2424.078,How did he disobey the order?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2424.078,2427.966,"Well, he would not be disobeying the order."
1975.74-532,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2432.852,2443.402,What bothers me Mr. Marston about this particular case is that the complaint which I gather is equivalent in your practice to information.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2443.402,2444.88,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2444.88,2452.098,The complaint seems to telescope two alternative provisions of the criminal statute.
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2508.362,2510.236,"Well sir, I do not believe so."
1975.74-532,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2510.236,2511.155,Why not?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2527.781,2528.39,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.39,2532.936,And that has nothing to do with any charge that he sold anything that would have been judicially determined to be obscene?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2532.936,2533.581,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2533.581,2542.477,"It simply is a claim that he sold obscene printed or written material which puts in issue the question of whether or not the printed or written material is obscene, is it not?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2542.477,2542.975,"No sir, I do not think so."
1975.74-532,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.975,2543.999,Why not?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2543.999,2550.794,"Because that word obscene there in that the complaint could be construed that way, but that did not how the Alabama Supreme Court construed it."
1975.74-532,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2553.253,2594.53,"No, as far as the statute makes it an offense to sell obscene material and also makes it an offense to sell material that is judicially been determined to be obscene whether or not it is obscene, if you look at Section 374 (4) 1 on page 5 of the brief of the petitioner, here the complaint telescopes two alternative sections of the criminal statute, and therefore, made it incumbent upon the prosecution to show both that the material was obscene and also that the material was known to have been judicially declared to be obscene, you see my point?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2594.53,2607.705,"Yes sir, I think so because they say obscene printed material that has been judicially determined to be obscene, I believe that the word obscene when it says obscene printed material, whatever, is simply describing the thing."
1975.74-532,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.705,2624.768,"Well, it is quite different from what the statute says which makes it an offense to send any mailable material known by such person to have been judicially found to be obscene under this chapter, quite different?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2624.768,2629.106,I do not see the distinction.
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.653,2647.345,"Well, the Trial Court said that the charge or the offense has been charged, it does not include the issue of obscenity?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2647.345,2648.186,"Yes sir, that was charged to the jury."
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.186,2650.069,"Under the power of Court ruling, was it not?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2650.069,2651.137,That was charged to the jury.
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.252,2660.28,"Well, but in the colloquy before that, the judge made that ruling, did he not?"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2660.28,2661.917,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2661.917,2665.549,"Mr. Marston, I put this case to you."
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2685.955,2702.996,"Yes, well sir, of course this is why I say that in spite of the petitioner’s interpretation of the Alabama Supreme Court decision to the effect that the question of obscenity was closed without regard to anything else is simply is not so."
1975.74-532,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.918,2740.719,But a declaratory judgment will not do him much good if he is already in jail as a result of a criminal prosecution?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2740.719,2746.022,Well as soon as he found out about it he could file that criminal prosecution.
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2751.95,2755.158,But not criminal case?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2759.023,2764.283,"Well, you could not, after he got arrested, he could have not, I guess you could still file the declaratory judgment action then."
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.283,2766.025,But could he have used it in criminal case?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2766.025,2766.832,No sir.
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2766.945,2770.328,He still goes to jail whether he got a declaratory judgment?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2770.328,2770.769,Yes sir.
1975.74-532,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.769,2773.245,To keep him more?
1975.74-532,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2773.245,2776.411,He would not have the burden or proof in that declaratory judgment?
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2776.411,2807.146,"The Law of Alabama is very clear that the would be censor has the burden of proof and that case came up in the cased cited, I believe by both parties, I know by us, Visual Educators v. Koppel in which it happen to involve a suit by a theater, an expresser against the city that did not want to license it and the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in no uncertain terms, of course, they say the burden is on the would be censor."
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.166,2842.332,"I think, a publication as declared obscene in Mobile in a civil proceeding brought by the state against Mr. A and then the state attorney general takes a copy of that declaration and injunction and mails it to all the bookstores in the state and the law says that anybody who sells in the face of that declaration is guilty of contempt."
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2860.073,2861.979,"No, under this statute?"
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2861.979,2865.508,"Well, I would say under the constitution if the state --"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2865.508,2866.45,It has the statute like that.
1975.74-532,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2866.45,2874.6,"If the state provided and has that sort of a provision, I would think a fortiori you would say that --"
1975.74-532,1,32139,joseph_g_l_marston_iii,,2874.6,2876.949,I think if you are talking about contempt.
