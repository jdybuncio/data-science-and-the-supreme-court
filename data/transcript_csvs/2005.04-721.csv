2005.04-721,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.372,We'll hear argument next in Evans versus Chavis.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,5.846,8.262,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-721,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,68.389,76.15,"But that's something... where would we... we would just pick that number, that--"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,76.15,78.958,The 60 days?
2005.04-721,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,78.958,79.621,--Yes.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,78.958,119.327,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, when California does look to timeliness in proceeding from one lower court to a higher court, then we see that it contemplates that a... that a litigant will proceed in 60 days or less, because... and the reason we have to turn to analogies is because nothing in California law requires the appellate courts in State habeas to look to that particular period of time between the lower court decision and proceeding to that court, because they're courts of original jurisdiction."
2005.04-721,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.888,140.161,"Well, can't--"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,140.161,138.346,--we look--
2005.04-721,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,138.346,145.987,"--the... can't the California courts adopt a... give us a 60-day rule, or a 30-day rule, or a 90-day rule?"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,147.764,149.829,"--Up to this point, they have not done so."
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,167.983,168.907,I don't know how this came about.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,188.505,192.697,"--I'm sorry, how the 3 year delay happened?"
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,192.697,192.927,No.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,225.663,226.316,Correct.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,226.316,230.196,Are those 20 days or 30 days counted in the tolling period?
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,259.995,260.688,Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,260.688,262.332,This isn't just 20 or 30 days.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,262.332,263.045,Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,263.045,264.009,"So, is it timely?"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,264.009,264.78,Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,264.78,268.832,"And, there, I thought the court said... I mean, I was reading it... say,"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,277.226,278.601,And there was an equitable--
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,278.601,278.811,On--
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,278.811,279.744,--tolling question.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,279.744,280.555,--But that had nothing to--
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,280.555,280.745,Right.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,280.745,281.235,--do with the case.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,320.799,321.851,Yes.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,321.851,322.203,Now--
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,322.203,322.704,Justice--
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.704,324.176,--we now get a case where it's 3 years.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,324.176,324.609,--Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,324.609,326.013,"And the court says,"
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.955,338.66,Isn't it--
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,338.66,338.87,"Now, what do you--"
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.87,338.951,--worse than that?
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,338.951,340.615,--do in those circumstances?
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,340.615,341.578,"Justice Breyer, I could not agree--"
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,341.578,342.229,"No, but did--"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,342.229,342.42,--with you more.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,342.42,343.321,--you ask for rehearing en banc?
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,346.661,349.539,We petitioned for certiorari in this Court.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,349.539,351.243,And you didn't ask for a hearing en banc.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,351.243,352.147,"No, we did not."
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,352.147,352.778,"Well, why, when you--"
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.778,352.958,Would--
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,352.958,355.316,--get a fair... because any judge can make a mistake--
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,355.316,352.778,The--
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,352.778,359.588,"--why don't you just go and ask the Ninth Circuit to say,"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,363.838,370.017,--This is not the first time that we have tried to take that approach with the Ninth Circuit on this issue.
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.883,392.534,--Yes.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,392.714,392.904,"This is, by the way--"
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.904,402.233,"--this case is different, actually, from the one that Justice Breyer put, because, in this case, the California Supreme Court didn't say--"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,402.233,402.653,--Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.653,403.096,"--""# on the merits""."
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,409.032,409.823,It's worse.
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.823,418.591,"It's whether... not whether it can be, nonetheless, timely when they say ""on the merits"", but whether it can be, nonetheless, timely when they don't say anything at all."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,418.591,420.405,But--
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.405,422.733,"I would think it's an a fortiori case, in other words."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,422.733,430.214,--And the Ninth Circuit is treating it as if it were the same sort of decision that was before this Court in Carey versus Saffold.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,440.293,446.542,"You're representing the attorney general of California, and you have a lot of litigation in the Ninth Circuit."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,459.11,459.571,Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,459.571,467.504,"--it seems to perhaps, inadvertently or not... and the reason I turn to you is, judges are busy, they have huge dockets--"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,467.504,467.504,Yes.
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,467.504,474.565,"--And, often, unless it's very clearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers take action, you get... waste everybody's time and money."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,474.565,475.165,Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,512.085,520.6,"In... even if, as he alleged, he was unable to do anything in--"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,520.6,521.371,--Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.371,521.912,--This is a layperson.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,543.285,544.159,Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.159,550.687,"""# I had to be at work. "" ""And that's why it took me all this time. """
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,550.687,550.687,Uh huh.
2005.04-721,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,550.687,557.898,"Now, is that... suppose the prison locks down someone and say,"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,559.483,564.215,"This is an easy decision for the Federal Court, even on these facts."
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.329,616.986,"So, in other words, he delays, after he gets the library access, for an extra year."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,616.986,618.248,"Yes, he does."
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,619.322,620.796,"Now, is there any excuse they're making for that?"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,622.5,622.69,--Later on--
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,622.69,622.87,--going to tell me.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,622.87,625.629,"--later on, once he gets to Federal Court--"
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,625.629,625.629,Yes.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,625.629,629.469,--he offers the explanation that the prison was on lockdowns.
2005.04-721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.957,654.936,Can I ask a rather probably sort of stupid question?
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,675.535,685.447,"The problem with that is... certainly, it would solve things, but the problem with that is, it would require the... require the California courts to make both of those determinations in every case."
2005.04-721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.979,696.4,"But they could adopt a 60 day rule, or a 90 day rule, and then just, when they decided to not follow the rule, they'd put a check on... say,"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,698.324,700.472,--They could do that--
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.472,702.507,"Under our current law, it wouldn't make any difference, would it?"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,708.214,709.035,--Correct.
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.035,709.798,--it doesn't matter.
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,709.798,710.419,That's true.
2005.04-721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,714.17,714.631,"Well, may--"
2005.04-721,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,714.631,714.871,"Well, it might--"
2005.04-721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,714.871,716.506,"--may I... no, go ahead."
2005.04-721,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,716.506,720.666,"--I was just going to say, it might matter if they had another postcard that said it's untimely, and they didn't send that."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,722.593,734.206,"--That's true, but we are... we are engaging here in trying to tell the California State Courts how to dispose of these cases, which I am really not sure is an appropriate thing for us to do."
2005.04-721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,735.027,735.218,"Well, but--"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,735.218,735.528,--using a--
2005.04-721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,735.528,735.699,--if we--
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,735.699,735.528,--procedure--
2005.04-721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,735.528,746.489,"--if we decided it... it was at least appropriate to give a hint, aren't we in a little bit better position than you suggested, in the light of Carey?"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,787.09,788.664,--If they were to do that.
2005.04-721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,799.554,799.844,I don't--
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,799.844,799.844,It--
2005.04-721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,800.014,799.844,--see why.
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.993,812.038,"Well, in this--"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,812.038,812.131,--But the--
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.131,825.942,"--in this case, in order to determine it was untimely, they would have presumably had to have gone into the factual analysis of whether the prison was on lockdown, whether he delayed for a year after getting the materials, and all of that stuff."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,835.831,836.271,--And that--
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.271,839.399,"But the ""timely"" question is still before Federal Courts."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,842.618,842.679,--I agree.
2005.04-721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.11,844.094,"--although they can avoid it, we can't."
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,844.094,847.162,--And that... and that is the way the State Courts are approaching these cases.
2005.04-721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.59,886.801,I--

2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,899.147,903.679,"--It would, but it's not a State law question."

2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,922.11,922.401,--because of the--
2005.04-721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.401,922.581,--Doesn't the--

2005.04-721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.911,933.06,--California Supreme Court sometimes decide that the time between the intermediate court's decision and the filing in the California Supreme Court... don't they ask whether that was reasonable?
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,933.06,933.661,--I have--
2005.04-721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.661,935.796,Or they only relate it back to the day of the conviction?
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,935.796,949.184,"--I have only seen one case in California where they specifically addressed that particular interval because the Attorney General raised it, and that's the Moss... in re Moss, which is cited in the red brief."
2005.04-721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.184,958.984,"May I ask that, if you had a case in which the Attorney General raised the... say, this case, and yet... and say California Supreme Court wrote an opinion in which it said,"
2005.04-721,0,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,981.108,984.718,"Yes, because the State Court found it timely, and that would be--"
2005.04-721,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,984.718,985.499,It would?

2005.04-721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1830.852,1831.703,And this could be--
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.703,1832.367,"But, now, maybe I'm--"
2005.04-721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.367,1836.187,"--just one point, if I may, Justice Breyer... those are the California Supreme Court or California appellate court?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1836.187,1837.743,That's the California Supreme Court.
2005.04-721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1837.743,1837.983,Thank you.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1837.983,1838.334,Okay.
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.334,1849.587,"--So, the difficulty of looking to that, which may be a good difficulty... I mean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we wrote in the case... see, there are two problems here."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1981.059,1981.339,Okay.
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.572,2069.648,Why is that the most reasonable presumption?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2080.518,2067.572,--The--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.572,2089.518,"--and where that issue is not absolutely clear, and the... and the merits issue is absolutely clear, it just... it just denies?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2089.518,2091.373,--The answer... pardon me--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.373,2101.234,"It doesn't want to say ""denied on the merits"", because that would suggest that it was timely."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2101.234,2106.82,"--The answer, I would suggest, Justice Scalia, requires looking to California practice."
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.708,2160.528,I don't know what it... 51 percent.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2170.937,2181.707,"--It's certainly the case, Justice Scalia, that the presumptions the Ninth Circuit adopted could permit cases that even the California State Courts would consider to be untimely--"
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.707,2182.729,"Well, we could work with that."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2189.84,2192.055,"--Well, that's the--"
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.055,2198.835,"You'd have to get some professor to go through these cases, and they could... they could figure out how long it is."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2200.39,2203.148,"--I can't really answer that, and that's at the heart of--"
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.148,2206.016,"But, I mean, is it more like a month, or is it more like 3 years?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2206.016,2218.993,"--Well, the reason I would suggest that... and answering that is not necessarily appropriate or helpful in resolving the question... is because of the series of cases that we quoted in footnote 15 of our brief."
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.93,2227.93,Because?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2227.93,2231.149,"--In one instance, it was because of attorney abandonment."
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.057,2234.617,"So, there's a special reason."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2237.805,2240.08,"Oh, I think it would apply to our case, as well."
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.08,2240.561,Because?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2240.561,2243.129,"In our case, the first 15 months--"
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.129,2243.33,"No, forget that."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2245.204,2251.831,"--After that, our client was effectively on lockdown and had no access whatsoever to the library."
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.613,2282.419,"But... well, did your... did your client file an affidavit or something saying he didn't have access to the library during the whole period of 3 years?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2282.419,2286.038,"I wouldn't call it an affidavit, but it was... he filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss."
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.038,2286.872,Well--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2286.872,2287.283,And--
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.283,2290.291,"--is there anything in the record that says, during the year after they said,"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2295.375,2295.776,--Yes.
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.719,2303.727,"Well, all right, so what's his reason for saying that,"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2309.134,2310.626,--That he had had... had access to nothing.
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.193,2312.473,"So, what does it say?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2313.595,2327.093,"--Well, it would be on the Joint Appendix, pages 38 and 39, where he describes the lockdown. And, you know, I haven't looked at it recently, but my understanding is that he was suggesting that he had had access to nothing, including the prison library."
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.42,2352.85,Well--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2352.85,2353.672,--evidentiary hearing--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.672,2353.814,--the burden--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2353.814,2354.285,--to determine--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.285,2355.086,--for that one is on him.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2367.902,2368.793,--Of course.
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.983,2369.133,I mean--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2369.133,2369.407,--the burden--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.407,2369.897,--well--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2369.897,2370.048,--Pardon me.
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.298,2380.508,"Now, the--"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2380.508,2381.16,--wasn't available.
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.16,2389.314,"--the next thing, what he actually says here, is that the C facility where he was confined was put into lockdown clearly into February 1997."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2400.945,2401.446,But that--
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2401.446,2404.224,"--where he's not in lockdown, and he has access to the library."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2404.224,2406.138,--But that illustrates the very--
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.138,2406.421,About six months.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2406.421,2407.943,"--That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.424,2539.994,May I just interrupt?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2551.687,2555.209,"--It presumes that if it's within 90 days, it's timely."
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.209,2555.769,Right.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2555.769,2556.993,And then you engage in the inquiry.
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.687,2562.38,"No, I understand."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2567.504,2568.115,"No, they do not."
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.611,2583.178,"Well, I could see how they could overcome a presumption that way, but there's not even a presumption that over 90 days is unreasonable."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2583.178,2583.538,--That is correct.
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.538,2584.089,--There isn't.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2584.772,2584.772,There is not.
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.772,2594.611,"--You mean if you go in and you say, 90 days, and you bring in no evidence whatever of any excuse for being over 90 days, you're telling me that California Supreme Court would accept it?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2594.611,2595.152,"No, that's not true."
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.442,2596.315,"Well, then--"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2596.315,2596.676,--the--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.676,2597.236,--then it is a presumption--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2597.236,2597.717,--That's correct.
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.717,2602.58,"--that if it's over 90 days, unless you have a reason, it's untimely."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2602.58,2606.411,The burden shifts the prisoner to produce some evidence.
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.636,2613.253,"So, here we have 180 days... 180 days, twice 90... with no excuse at all presented."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2613.253,2614.757,--In the noncapital context.
2005.04-721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2650.193,2651.045,But once it's--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2651.045,2651.045,And--
2005.04-721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2651.045,2664.062,"--in the Federal habeas context, the AEDPA law suggests there's a great premium paid... at stake for promptly resolving these things."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2667.912,2682.957,"--If it were the case... and there's no evidence on the record to suggest this... that a substantial number of cases were going to start coming through California with massive delays, and this Court was going to be forced to provide statutory tolling, that would be a problem."
2005.04-721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2686.068,2688.454,"Well, what would we do in that situation?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2688.454,2689.928,--If that--
2005.04-721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2689.928,2690.108,If it's--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2690.108,2690.719,--started happening?
2005.04-721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2690.719,2691.671,--open to the Federal Courts.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2691.671,2696.345,"If that started happening, I think you, in this Court, would do nothing."
2005.04-721,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2703.776,2704.097,"Amend just for California, when the system is working fine, all the other States that do have the timelines?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2711.367,2714.636,"I don't think they would do that, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-721,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2731.168,2731.829,To do what?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2731.168,2737.726,"I believe it replaces the word ""pending"" with some replacement."
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2755.526,2755.576,What about this?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2832.553,2846.033,"--Well, I think the problem with that sort of rule, Justice Breyer, is that it risks error, because California's standard is to indeterminate, and at very little... it gets very little benefit."
2005.04-721,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2880.097,2881.379,"Well, how can you... how can you say that?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2900.706,2902.952,"--I would say two things about that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-721,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2936.808,2940.297,Why do you think the Federal statute necessarily imports a State standard?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2954.822,2956.596,"--That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-721,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2986.852,2994.093,"All right, but we decided... I'd like you to suggest something to... from putting yourself in the... in an imaginary position."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3031.143,3035.876,"Well, I would be lying, Justice Breyer, if I didn't say that I haven't thought about that."
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.6,3115.398,May I ask just two questions about California?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3124.997,3132.038,"Well, I wouldn't characterize it as a problem, because, like I said before, I don't think that--"
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3132.038,3137.434,"But is the condition, that there is the long delay, that primarily occurs in the... in the application of State Supreme Court?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3137.744,3154.092,"--I have no... I've seen no specific evidence to be able to answer that with any citation, but my understanding, Justice Stevens, is that that makes sense, because it's the last process that the prisoner is going to be able to engage in, then they'll have to go to the Federal Circuit."
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.092,3164.782,"--Then my second question is, Have we decided, or is it a matter of common practice in California, that the application to the California Supreme Court is necessary in order to complete the exhaustion?"
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3164.782,3169.545,"It is... it is necessary, in my opinion."
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.711,3172.292,We've held it--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3172.292,3172.472,--decided that.
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.472,3176.684,"--in cases where there's direct review, but this is a different sort of animal that you have in California."
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3176.684,3183.895,"But once you start from the premise that these are functional appeals, which they are, I don't see how you could read AEDPA any other way."
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.151,3199.351,I think it is--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3199.351,3199.543,--didn't file--
2005.04-721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.543,3199.633,--required.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3199.633,3200.084,--Yes.
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.14,3206.462,There's one aspect of Saffold that you haven't addressed.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3236.32,3237.524,I would say two things about that.
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3237.524,3244.202,How could the Ninth Circuit here simply have ignored that criticism of exactly what they did here?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3244.202,3246.469,"Well, I don't believe they ignored it, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.132,3261.694,But we--
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3261.694,3262.415,--the claim--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3262.415,3263.779,--we didn't cite the en banc decision.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3265.554,3266.005,--The en banc--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.005,3266.235,--didn't we?
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3266.235,3267.396,--decision occurred after your--
2005.04-721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.396,3267.76,After.
2005.04-721,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3267.76,3267.76,--case.

2005.04-721,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3481.066,3481.299,Why?
2005.04-721,2,55331,catherine_baker_chatman,,3482.983,3491.238,--Because they like to see these claims presented along with the appeal to be... so that they can possibly bring them together and decide habeas claims in light of the record on appeal.
