1979.78-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.004,-- case is submitted.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,80.297,85.275,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,171.6,190.073,"Meanwhile, I assume, unless the -- the other members of the potential class read about it in the newspapers, would not have known anything about this lawsuit or its issues or -- is that correct?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,190.073,213.943,"We don't know the answer to that, Your Honor but we do know this that from 1971 to the present day, according to the record, not a single other customer of the bank has filed suit, joined this suit, sought to intervene or made a complaint."
1979.78-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,222.62,235.958,Of course your friend might argue that the -- they may have refrained from doing so in reliance upon the existence of what they thought was a class action even though it was not certified.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,235.958,242.688,"Well, of course my response to that, Your Honor would be that it was not certified."
1979.78-904,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,294.943,295.824,Mr. Goodman.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,295.824,296.217,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,296.217,301.549,"That I don't know whether you said or not, nobody tried to intervene."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,301.549,301.867,Nobody tried.
1979.78-904,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,301.867,304.94,Before or after up until now.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,304.94,306.498,And not now.
1979.78-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.521,369.287,"Mr. Goodman, you referred to our previous cases and certainly in cases like Jacobs and Sosna and Franks and United Airlines and Rodriguez, we have dealt with various trees in the class action for us."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,374.613,379.815,"Oh! I think that the cases are reconcilable, Your Honor."
1979.78-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,464.488,467.788,"Well, let's take it in McDonald."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,484.518,485.327,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.327,494.842,"Now, the only difference between that case and this one is that there's no intervenor but that the named plaintiffs want to appeal it on behalf of the class, right?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,494.842,495.465,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.465,500.766,"And that -- and you say that they shouldn't be able to do it because the named plaintiff's interest is over, it's moot."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,500.766,501.701,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.701,511.819,"Now, in McDonald, I would think as soon as the named plaintiffs had been paid off, his case was moot in McDonald and the case was moot."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,521.681,529.352,That's the reason I tried to say with difference that what we are talking about is an exercise in legal fiction.
1979.78-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.791,549.429,You're just saying a live controversy -- because of the -- the named plaintiffs into -- the named plaintiff was out of the case.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,551.392,551.814,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.814,554.691,And there had never been a certified class.
1979.78-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,554.691,562.371,In the -- in the intervenor in -- in effect didn't have to bring a class action.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,590.239,596.686,"Well, McDonald of -- of course troubles me and I wouldn't be candid if I -- if I didn't say that it did."
1979.78-904,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.877,624.737,"Yes, but the dissent said that the majority was quite wrong in saying that, but the majority stepped right to it."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,624.737,625.203,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,696.997,697.29,"Well, Mr. Goodman --"
1979.78-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,697.29,719.293,"What about -- what about Judge Thornberry's concurrence in the Fifth Circuit saying that if the named plaintiffs had accepted the tender, that's all a court had to decide -- had to -- to -- the Court didn't have to decide what the question would be then."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,724.162,724.372,Yes.
1979.78-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.327,730.798,Yes.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,730.798,734.1,But I see no -- no distinction.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,744.648,746.215,Except because there was no certification?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,746.215,747.189,No certification.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.189,754.444,"Well, does the plaintiff ever have a right to appeal from a denial of a request for class certification and is (Voice Overlap) -- what?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,754.444,755.364,Excuse me Your Honor.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,755.364,756.717,Does he ever have such a right?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,756.717,758.418,Certainly unless in the interim his claim becomes moot.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.418,760.0,Unless he wins the lawsuit?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,760.747,762.587,"Unless in the interim, his claim becomes moot."
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.587,771.13,"Supposing he -- he -- that his request is denied, then what is his -- what is he motivated to do? Should he try and win his individual claim?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,776.986,778.329,"In our judgment, he does."
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.329,783.697,"Well then, how could he -- what is his motivation at that point if he's lost on the class certification?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,787.184,798.935,"Well, we have to assume that the motivation of a named plaintiff is to recover --"
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.935,799.894,His individual claims?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,799.894,800.431,Yes.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.431,807.435,But you also then have to assume he has no separate legal interest in representing a class.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,807.435,818.146,"Well, you -- you have said that -- that he does as long as he himself possesses a live claim but not -- not that -- not in immortality."
1979.78-904,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,818.146,819.697,And I -- I don't get it.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,824.781,826.42,"Well, Your Honor --"
1979.78-904,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.42,832.303,"The way thing I read that in the opinion -- indeed, the opinion in this case said that they didn't."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,832.303,836.106,"Well -- well, let's talk about that a minute because that's one of the key things here."
1979.78-904,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.373,854.37,"Well, but the whole point is, if that was all of their claim, if you take the class action out and the only thing they're entitled to is 800 to 400, then they have great trouble with excess of 10,000, don't they?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,869.058,873.009,"Well, the -- there's also talk of settlement in the opinion and that's incorrect."
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.3,901.298,That's incorrect.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,919.299,920.205,They did.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.205,926.944,"And they -- they got half of it when you tendered them the money but they've never gotten, the first thing they asked, namely the right to represent everybody."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,926.944,927.026,"Well, that --"
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.026,929.107,And when did they lose that right?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,933.162,949.237,"Well, to -- to get right down at the lawsuit, Judge, there's no way that Rule 23, a rule of procedure, can somehow create appellate jurisdiction or power to decide a moot question."
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.237,955.303,"Well, but when did that the question become moot, the question of whether or not they could represent a class, when did that become moot?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,955.303,963.827,It became moot when there was nobody left in a lawsuit contending that the question still existed with counsel.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.827,964.091,Was it -- (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,964.091,965.729,There's nobody before the Court was --
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.729,968.452,The plaintiffs contended because they rejected your tender.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,983.925,986.767,Because the -- the controversy is moot.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.767,992.839,The individual controversy but not the -- not the controversy concerning their claimed right to represent this class.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,996.689,1000.97,"It became moot -- Your Honor as I've said, the minute their personal claims become --"
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.97,1006.296,(Voice Overlap) so you could've sent them the money but before even the class certification issue arose.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1006.296,1007.346,We could have but --
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.346,1009.088,It would've become moot then?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1009.088,1011.354,Not as I read the decisions of the Court.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.95,1023.179,But why not --
1979.78-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.179,1023.876,"Well, Mr. Goodman --"
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.876,1029.617,Why not give the appellate court the same right then?
1979.78-904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.617,1082.406,"Mr. Goodman, don't -- don't you really have to get down a little deeper than perhaps this Court has in some of its class action cases here and recognize that at least many courts have read into Rule 23 that it's -- it's basically a case managed not by clients but by lawyers and that the clients themselves probably couldn't care less about giving $12 a piece from the bank and that somehow rather -- whether it's -- as Justice Stevens says the other half of the issue or at least another part of the issue; one is whether each client will recover particular sum of money and the other of which is whether a rather large class which will furnish a rather large attorney's fee to attorneys will be certified or will not be certified?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1082.406,1112.512,"That's -- that's a candid look at it, Your Honor and I -- and I think that and I -- I realize that -- that I'm not satisfying your inquiries over here and the reason is that I think you're assuming with those questions that the -- if -- that when you filed a lawsuit, that somehow the rule when it permits you to request class action status, permits you to litigate that question all the way up, but here's the problem."
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.506,1175.708,"But Mr. Goodman, if you're talking in terms of power, I don't understand why a tender before the issue of certification is even presented at the trial judge, wouldn't equally moot the case."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1175.708,1178.611,"Well, I could -- I think I could make a strong argument that it would."
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.665,1180.682,"Sure, if you have made the argument that it would."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1189.751,1195.798,"But -- but, as I understand the -- the rulings, you've made the -- made the important distinction between --"
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.798,1196.192,"But logically, that --"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1196.192,1197.342,-- the time of certification.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.342,1204.562,"Logically, that distinction is the same whether it's -- whether it's before presentation of certification or an erroneous denial of certification."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1208.028,1208.675,"Yes, yes."
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.675,1219.538,"And if we carry -- if we accept your argument, carry to a logical conclusion, I think we should equally have to hold and maybe we should, that the defendant can run in before -- as soon as the complainants filed and pay off the plaintiff."
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1219.538,1220.242,I don't know.
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1220.593,1221.461,"Well, I don't know, why not?"
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1221.461,1221.518,Put --
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.518,1226.303,You'd -- you'd defeat a lot of class actions that way and people get their money.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1226.303,1226.772,The --
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.772,1227.95,The same thing you're doing here?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1227.95,1231.37,"The personal stake here, Your Honor is money --"
1979.78-904,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.37,1232.786,Same in my hypothetical.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1232.786,1234.119,-- is money.
1979.78-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1299.433,1305.813,You referring to the realism of this whole pattern of conduct earlier.
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1327.367,1327.788,Well that would --
1979.78-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1327.788,1328.697,Is that what you're saying?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1328.697,1330.592,I would hate to say it exactly that way.
1979.78-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1332.976,1342.425,But isn't that the realistic aspect of -- of great many class action not necessarily this one or any category for the great many class actions?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1354.389,1354.597,I wish I knew that one.
1979.78-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1354.597,1355.878,Isn't that the realism?
1979.78-904,0,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1355.878,1368.325,"The realism and I -- I wish I knew how to say this correctly, the realism is if the case should not be here and shouldn't be litigated when there is no controversy."
1979.78-904,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1403.357,1405.295,Very well.
1979.78-904,1,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,1409.035,1412.477,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-904,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.314,1518.018,"Well, Mr. Lyons, isn't that exactly of why we have to explore here not just the recovery of individual plaintiffs but whether in -- in adopting Rule 23, it was intended to confer not only the right to litigate about individual claims, but about the right to litigate whether or not a class should be certified as a class action?"
1979.78-904,1,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,1518.018,1518.298,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.41,1565.613,What were your options when the Court denied class action certification?
1979.78-904,1,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,1565.613,1579.992,"In fact, what happened when the Court denied class action certification in a Coopers & Lybrand proceeding, an interlocutory appeal was sought to the Fifth Circuit and the defendants successfully opposed it."
1979.78-904,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1620.637,1625.046,"Well, that -- that question as I understand in view of our limited grant, is not --"
1979.78-904,1,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,1625.046,1625.253,That before us --
1979.78-904,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1625.253,1629.148,-- before us here whether the Court of Appeals was right or wrong in the merits of the class action.
1979.78-904,1,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,1629.148,1629.739,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-904,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1629.739,1630.561,Isn't that correct?
1979.78-904,2,44709,william_f_goodman_jr,,1630.561,1631.211,That's correct.
1979.78-904,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1705.304,1707.435,"Mr. Lyons, let me get to this another way."

1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,1990.716,1998.033,"That, I think that that's the point because they had rejected that kind of offer of judgment and it would've just been a pick off system, one right after another."

1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.033,2105.659,That's what I mean.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2105.659,2111.755,-- the class claim is a properly certifiable class claim and that is the distinction.

1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2210.882,2211.236,"Yes, Sir."
1979.78-904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.726,2250.029,But you have to pray for certification in your complaint then --
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2250.029,2250.119,Yes.
1979.78-904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.119,2252.554,-- in order to harmonize it with Jacobs.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2252.554,2252.88,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2260.567,2276.951,"What you say on the practical side of it, these problems would be solved if there was a requirement of the transaction -- denial of certification be appealed within 30 days and resolved right at the threshold."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2276.951,2303.319,"That would be a solution to the problem and would avoid the dilemma that no -- no review of certification creates, but if there can be no immediate review of certification as we understand the law to be today, then -- unless, there is review after judgment, then you're down the dead end street of no review and you have to indulge in the presumption that the District Court's discretion on the denial of class action is infallible."
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.782,2330.677,"Well, all -- that -- that presupposes that it is a valid case or controversy type of Article III claim to say that you want to represent the class of people whom you don't know probably and very often, you wouldn't know them."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2335.595,2335.865,Case of controversy.
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2335.865,2338.525,-- a right itself clearly?
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2338.525,2347.99,"Well, the Court has said this that there is no absence of case of controversy when a named plaintiff's claim becomes moot before certification can take place."
1979.78-904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.098,2368.888,"When you refer to the doctrine relation back, are you referring to Sosna?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2368.888,2370.613,Footnote 11 in Sosna.
1979.78-904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.613,2373.906,"Well, though, that simply left the question open, didn't it?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2373.906,2379.192,"Your Honor, it does speak in the context of a transitory temporal type claim."
1979.78-904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.362,2401.561,That -- those are the kind of open questions that we've got to decide --
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2401.561,2402.047,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2402.047,2403.485,-- or put to one side in this case.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2403.485,2407.135,I don't think it requires any expansion of any existing precedent.
1979.78-904,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.107,2424.225,Mr. Lyons --
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2424.225,2429.586,-- because there is no way to go an appeal and go to the Fifth Circuit and get it reversed just like that.
1979.78-904,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2440.012,2456.525,"Mr. Lyons, apart from cases involving short time in the doctrine of evading review -- I -- I forgot the exact language, apart from those cases, has the Court ever squarely held that a tender in advance of an attempt to certify will not moot a case in a class section?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2456.525,2459.592,"This Court has not, the Seventh Circuit has."
1979.78-904,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.592,2484.836,"But -- but logically, it seems to me that -- we really -- that's sort of a, the bedrock of the whole argument is whether a tender even then might moot it because I think their argument applying advanced, simple certification as well after and he doesn't want to press that because I know it's an extreme position, but don't you have to start from the proposition that there is a case or controversy prior to certification even though the named plaintiff has been tendered all he's asked and therefore, he's no longer a good class representative, would be the argument."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2484.836,2485.239,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-904,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2490.387,2497.844,"But it's -- it's certifiable but 10 days after the lawsuit starts, the named plaintiff has tendered as $300 or whatever it is."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2502.51,2503.797,If he refuses the tender?
1979.78-904,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.797,2510.265,"Yes, he -- he's -- because he's -- he's no longer -- is shown he's not really interested in his own claim anymore."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2510.265,2517.962,"Well, he's interested in his own claim to the extent that he doesn't want to do anything to jeopardize the other prong of his being there and that's the fiduciary duty to the class."
1979.78-904,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.962,2521.855,"But I still try -- I must confess, I'm little troubled by Mr. Justice White's example."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2536.202,2548.748,"Because -- well, one distinction is when the payoff after the lawsuit is filed, that is the voluntary -- voluntary cessation of illegal conduct which is calculated to eviscerate Rule 23 what this Court ought not tolerate."
1979.78-904,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2548.748,2551.508,"No, it's not because it's voluntarily ceasing illegal conduct."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2558.078,2558.282,And -- and --
1979.78-904,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2558.282,2562.608,"And -- and then, how do we have a live case of controversy that can even be certified?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2562.608,2568.006,"Well, they did it because they wanted to avoid the fact that there's a good class action here, that's what they did it for."
1979.78-904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2568.006,2579.023,That's since WT grant on its head to say that paying a money judgment is a voluntary cessation of illegal conduct.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2582.324,2585.155,Not when it's a partial payment.
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2603.012,2617.349,"Mr. Lyons, you spoke of the fiduciary duty of the named plaintiff to the punitive class, from when is to that fiduciary rate of relationship arise?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2627.737,2627.93,By --
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2627.93,2628.546,-- I don't know.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2628.546,2635.036,-- permitting his name to be used in the U.S. District Courthouse on a complaint where the claim asked them for a class action treatment.
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2635.036,2635.452,Well --
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2635.452,2638.725,That's a commitment to that class.
1979.78-904,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.725,2649.784,"That was a -- that was the theory of the Court of Appeals and the opinion written by Judge Rubin but it wasn't necessarily the theory of Judge Thornberry and yet, it's not one that you have to adopt."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2649.784,2651.891,"Yes, that -- that is very correct."
1979.78-904,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2654.239,2656.725,Whether it's a matter of (Voice Overlap) or voluntary action.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2656.725,2670.123,"(Inaudible) on that in the abstract if the Court is interested but for the purposes of resolving this case, that question is not going to affect the result."
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2670.123,2673.731,There's nothing or I'll put those question to you.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2686.982,2703.348,"I don't think that class action rule could procedurally -- a rule of procedure could dictate what and what isn't substantive fiduciary duty, but I think that once you cast yourself in that role that just under the general rules that apply to fiduciaries, you got certain responsibilities."
1979.78-904,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2703.348,2707.286,"In other words, do you -- you don't need to contend that you had a duty to appeal."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2707.286,2707.816,Absolutely not.
1979.78-904,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2708.983,2709.967,"Well, the Court of Appeal held that you did."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2709.967,2713.346,"In the Fifth Circuit, I contend it that there was a right but not a duty."
1979.78-904,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.881,2716.787,"-- a privilege, an option not a right."
1979.78-904,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2716.787,2721.295,Class action was just a procedure.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2724.677,2725.29,That's correct.
1979.78-904,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.023,2730.336,That's why I'm wondering when a fiduciary thing gets in there.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2730.336,2737.886,"Well, if -- if I come forward and I say, ""I want to represent myself and everybody else,"" and I avail myself with a federal procedural rule --"
1979.78-904,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2737.886,2739.153,That's --
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2739.153,2739.783,I'm not sure --
1979.78-904,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.783,2749.583,"But my point is, is that before or after the class is certified, that's my point that the fiduciary part comes in."

1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2757.349,2784.503,"But if there is a fiduciary duty, it's -- it's got to be a two-way street and if there -- if -- if that's the concept, then it may have been -- it might be that making a settlement that conceivably would moot the action would be a violation of that fiduciary duty and that when these people accepted the money --"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2784.503,2786.23,"They didn't accept money, Your Honor."
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2787.363,2789.391,"Now, under -- I'm not speaking in your case, I'm speaking of the abstract --"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2789.391,2790.193,Yes sir.
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2790.193,2798.013,-- of class actions when if -- if settlement is made and people get 300 or 200 or whatever.
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2802.314,2805.81,If this act of certification has been refused.
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.81,2807.373,"Well, before or after?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2807.373,2817.663,"Well, before, I think it's a real problem because you could extract a greater claim in your own individual behalf and it's really worth in order to avoid the -- the threat to the defendant of the class recovery."
1979.78-904,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2881.995,2892.432,"But all this is hypothetical because -- would you care to venture a guess as to how many of the 90 people -- 90,000 people know anything about this in the absence of a certification and notices?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2892.432,2901.492,"No, I have no way of knowing what communication that -- that the bank has made available to them over the years if they would have inquired the bank as to what is going on in this lawsuit."
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.67,2947.142,But are you suggesting that he say they -- they just didn't pay off everybody but are -- are you suggesting as they admitted liability?
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2947.142,2948.663,It was without prejudice.
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.663,2949.46,"Well, that's what I thought."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2957.548,2959.383,Of course they paid here to get away the class action too (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.383,2963.815,"Well, that's what -- I know but they didn't admit liability."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2963.815,2965.015,"They did not admit liability, yes."
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.015,2966.093,Yes.

1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.351,2973.566,"Exactly, so you may not have been entitled to your payment."
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,2973.566,2975.84,But we have not had them trial on the merits.
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.026,3048.837,Can I -- can I ask you one thing?
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,3059.332,3069.695,"I -- we contended all along, Your Honor, that the dismissal of the case after we had claimed for class action treatment ought not to take in place."
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.769,3087.253,"Well, what -- what is the -- what is the status of the named plaintiffs' case now on this case?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,3087.253,3090.769,The named plaintiffs' claim was paid into the registry of the District Court.
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.769,3093.133,"Yes, and what happened to the case?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,3093.133,3095.555,The case was dismissed by the District Judge.
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.555,3096.497,Why?
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,3096.497,3103.465,"Well, the certification had been refused and then the money was paid into the court and based upon the tender --"
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.465,3103.73,But --
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,3103.73,3108.084,"-- the judgment was entered, dismissing a -- remain -- the remaining portion of the case."
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.084,3111.067,"Well, and what have you tried to appeal?"
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,3111.067,3115.21,We appealed the right to proceed on behalf of the class.
1979.78-904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.21,3117.523,Why didn't you appeal with dismissal?
1979.78-904,3,19402,champ_lyons_jr,,3117.523,3122.695,"Yes, we filed a notice of appeal of the entire action and took it to the Fifth Circuit."
