1991.90-6113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.567,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-6113, Randall D. White v. Illinois."
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,11.06,19.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.607,107.021,These two declarations were both admitted by the Illinois courts under what?
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,116.937,118.279,"That's right, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.015,166.019,"Mr. Peterson, I understand that in this case the child victim was actually in the courtroom."
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,166.019,167.672,"That's right, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.672,175.625,And I suppose that in Illinois the defendant's attorney could have called that child for cross-examination.
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,175.625,185.393,Under Illinois law he has the right to call witnesses as if under cross-examination.
1991.90-6113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.393,185.653,Yes.
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,187.075,187.874,"No, it wasn't."
1991.90-6113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.874,193.398,"Do you think there is a waiver here, then, of this so-called right of confrontation?"
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,195.899,198.242,"No, Your Honor, there is no waiver."
1991.90-6113,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,245.142,248.974,What exactly did you want the State to do that it did not do?
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,268.888,286.079,"Your Honor, the predicate for establishing the admissibility of hearsay evidence under these circumstances is prior to introducing the evidence, the State must either establish that the child is unavailable or elicit that child's testimony from the stand."
1991.90-6113,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.211,325.525,"If that statement, that the child failed to take the stand had been supplemented in effect by a court finding that the child could not testify for whatever reason, as a matter of capacity, emotional condition and whatnot, that then would have satisfied the unavailability requirement."
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,325.525,328.299,"Certainly, by a trial court finding, that's correct."
1991.90-6113,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,328.299,335.032,Now what if the child had been available and the only thing the State wanted was to use the hearsay statements.
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,339.957,346.809,The Confrontation Clause requires that the defendant be confronted with the witnesses against him.
1991.90-6113,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.427,361.091,You don't mean that they can't introduce hearsay at all?
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,361.091,361.979,"--No, I don't."
1991.90-6113,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,369.917,372.876,What then would be satisfactory to you?
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,384.685,386.227,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,386.227,388.907,And the State has no option?
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,390.079,400.664,"The Confrontation Clause requires that the prosecution produce the witnesses against the defendant, and I suggest that means that they produce the testimony of those witnesses."
1991.90-6113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.664,419.488,"Mr. Peterson, you are assuming that even though there is a well-recognized exception to the hearsay rule and the law of evidence, nonetheless, the Confrontation Clause requires that the witness speak from the stand."
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,425.022,426.131,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,426.131,431.155,So that is one place where the Government would not have to show that they are unavailable.
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,431.155,433.457,"That's correct, and--"
1991.90-6113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.457,445.725,"And aren't these well-recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule too, the spontaneous declarations principle and the testimony or declarations made while submitting yourself for a medical exam?"
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,445.725,448.617,--They are well-recognized exceptions.
1991.90-6113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.781,468.048,"So what is your authority from this court for saying that any time the State or Government wants to offer hearsay, they have to show either that the witness is unavailable or bring the witness to the stand?"
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,468.048,469.741,"The Confrontation Clause, sir--"
1991.90-6113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.741,472.312,"But I mean, what case is interpreting it?"
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,472.312,479.025,"--I would suggest Maryland v. Craig, where this Court balanced the competing interests that are at issue in this case."
1991.90-6113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.742,491.443,"Well, Craig involved a residual hearsay exception."
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,495.297,497.217,I believe that was Idaho v. Wright.
1991.90-6113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,498.209,500.4,"Oh, we have... Craig was the television set?"
1991.90-6113,0,25899,gary_r_peterson,,500.4,501.201,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1079.964,1085.007,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1181.374,1192.16,"Do you think that is as true of a 5-year-old child, Ms. Anderson, as it would be of an adult making a statement to a doctor in the course of getting treatment?"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1192.16,1208.102,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that a child, even at a young age such as 4 or 5, understands that when he or she is going to the doctor they are going to an authority figure and that they are going for a certain reason, that is, to obtain help."
1991.90-6113,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1230.635,1234.739,The State of Illinois has a hearsay exception for child testimony--
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1234.739,1236.469,"Yes, they do--"
1991.90-6113,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1236.469,1238.502,"--that was not invoked in this case, is that correct?"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1238.502,1240.242,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1240.242,1247.598,"Can we draw any inference from that, that the unavailability could not be shown?"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1247.598,1250.861,"No, I don't think that is the case."
1991.90-6113,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1268.365,1276.439,"And I would take it that it would cover kinds of testimony that would not be covered by spontaneous declaration or medical testimony, i.e.--"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1276.439,1276.699,That's true.
1991.90-6113,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1276.699,1281.611,--if the child made the report 2 weeks later when it couldn't be a spontaneous declaration.
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1281.611,1282.011,That's true.
1991.90-6113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.011,1296.341,"Don't you have some... I know that your opponent hasn't differentiated among the five statements here, but wouldn't you have some difficulty with a police officer's statement under a spontaneous declaration, if he came in and questioned the child?"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1298.121,1304.376,"Well, it was still made during the period when this child was still under the stress of this event."
1991.90-6113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.774,1325.299,You think responding to questions from a police officer 45 minutes after the event falls squarely within the spontaneous declaration exception?
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1325.299,1329.603,I think that there are other indications of reliability.
1991.90-6113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.065,1340.18,"But do you think for the admissibility of statement A, you can rely on the fact that it is consistent with other statements that are admissible, can they buttress admissibility in that way?"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1342.271,1345.904,"No, I am--"
1991.90-6113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.904,1356.251,"In other words, could you have had one 3 or 4 weeks later, a whole series of statements that were all consistent but not within any exception other than being consistent... no exception for consistent statements."
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1356.251,1358.001,"--I agree with you, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.55,1393.624,"Would you agree with your opponent's answer to my question, that the defendant could not have cross-examined the child during the prosecution's case?"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1393.624,1395.286,"I agree with that, yes."
1991.90-6113,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.286,1402.089,"Ms. Anderson, I would like to get your response to the same question I asked Mr. Peterson."
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1431.88,1435.542,"It is just based on prior case law, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1491.849,1493.82,It is not just reliability.
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1504.568,1504.856,That is reliable--
1991.90-6113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.856,1517.615,"--than the person's testimony 2 years later, but certainly I think it would be inconsistent with our Confrontation Clause analysis and our sense of what it ought to mean to permit that."
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1519.478,1519.636,--That's true.
1991.90-6113,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1545.304,1548.446,"Well, but it's always a replacement for the out-of-court declarant."
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1548.446,1553.439,"It's a replacement, but it is not intended solely as a replacement."
1991.90-6113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.101,1777.235,Would you argue that the same result would obtain here if the child hadn't been available?
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1782.799,1786.952,"--The prosecution did try to put her on the stand, yes."
1991.90-6113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.952,1796.947,"Well, you would be arguing, and making the same argument, I suppose, if the child hadn't--"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1796.947,1798.529,"It would be the same argument, yes."
1991.90-6113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.529,1799.601,--hadn't even been in town.
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1799.601,1813.278,"Basically, yes, it's the same argument, that the Compulsory Process Clause would provide the defendant enough protection if he decided that he did want to call the witness."
1991.90-6113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.278,1816.1,So the fact that the child was in the courtroom doesn't help your case very much?
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1816.1,1817.53,It certainly helps our case.
1991.90-6113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.53,1818.541,It does help.
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1818.982,1825.677,It shows that the State made a good faith effort to call this witness.
1991.90-6113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.611,1835.082,How is that relevant to the Confrontation Clause issue?
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1835.082,1864.962,"It is relevant in the sense that the defendant is... it's implying that the State is trying to get in certain evidence, hearsay statements of this kind just to avoid putting these witnesses on the stand, and that's not the case."
1991.90-6113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.962,1874.038,"But if I understand the position in your brief, even if the State were doing that, evidence would still be admissible."
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1874.038,1879.691,That's true--
1991.90-6113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1879.691,1890.119,"Even if the State could have put the person on, but just decided technically it would be better not to, and even arranged for the child to be in Europe or someplace, what would be the result of those facts?"
1991.90-6113,1,15410,arleen_c_anderson,,1892.721,1896.753,"--Under our position, yes, the hearsay would come in."
1991.90-6113,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2044.17,2053.536,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2141.633,2147.377,"Well, Mr. Nightingale, what about the statement that was made 45 minutes later to the policeman."
1991.90-6113,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2168.943,2188.244,"At some point, certainly, a State court finding that a statement was an excited utterance would take it so far beyond the accepted core definition of that hearsay exception that it could no longer be regarded as firmly-rooted."
1991.90-6113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2223.426,2230.051,And I suppose there is some question here about statements of a very young child to a doctor.
1991.90-6113,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2245.102,2246.491,"I wouldn't think so, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.793,2267.125,"Do you think that is true of a child of, let's say, 2 years of age?"
1991.90-6113,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2267.125,2278.732,"--Again, there comes a time when... when the child is incapable of perhaps making a reliable statement, but certainly that is not the case here."
1991.90-6113,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.092,2328.677,"As I see it, as the case comes here, we judge it on the basis that all these statements were within some recognized hearsay exception because that... that is, the case isn't challenged."
1991.90-6113,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2328.677,2365.48,"I agree with Your Honor, and not only that, within the core of the accepted hearsay exceptions there was evidence here that the child had been awoke, had been awoken at 4:00 a.m. in the morning, that she had been restrained in a way that caused injuries to her face, that she had been crying very hard, and accepting as well her account of what happened to her, I think it was well within the trial court's discretion to conclude that the state of excitement, which is essentially the guarantee of reliability, persisted for 45 minutes."
1991.90-6113,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.48,2373.154,"While I have got you interrupted, would you think the prosecution would have to have... make the child available in the courtroom?"
1991.90-6113,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2373.154,2375.408,I don't believe it's required.
1991.90-6113,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.06,2391.866,"What if the defense says, well, we notice that the child isn't in the courtroom."
1991.90-6113,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2400.462,2412.27,The defendant has the right to secure a subpoena and the State then has an obligation to use reasonable efforts to secure the child's production at that point.
1991.90-6113,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.335,2424.017,"Let me ask you a question, Mr. Nightingale, in this case we have got two exceptions."
1991.90-6113,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2437.387,2442.12,"Your Honor, the State had, before the statute was passed, a case law--"
1991.90-6113,3,25899,gary_r_peterson,,2660.421,2661.853,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-6113,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.765,2743.447,"Excuse me, you think the child was contemplating litigation?"
1991.90-6113,3,25899,gary_r_peterson,,2743.447,2744.408,--No.
1991.90-6113,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.408,2758.987,"I mean, when you say, when the Government says in contemplation of litigation, I think it means to say that the declarant is contemplating litigation, and so it is at a deposition, the declarant knows the deposition is going to be used in later litigation or something of that sort."
1991.90-6113,3,25899,gary_r_peterson,,2763.399,2778.879,"I would agree with that, and under that approach, I would suppose that a child would never be considered a witness against the accused, as children... most of their statements, I would suggest, may never contemplate that they will be made in contemplation of litigation."
1991.90-6113,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2864.966,2867.209,"Thank you, Mr. Peterson."
