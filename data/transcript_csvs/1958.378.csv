1958.378,0,40734,raphael_h_weissman,,0.0,6.098,".Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3530.337,3536.616,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3835.542,3836.224,Mr. Hurley.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3836.224,3837.338,Yes Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3837.338,3851.9,"May I ask you one question? Under this order, that you have just been reading, did the judge have the authority to grant immunity to any witness who might come before him?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3851.9,3861.38,"No Your Honor, that is very interesting question and we have found that there is no such power in the justice to grant immunity."
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3875.643,3886.05,You mean the immunity if it justifies or must he -- maybe -- must he respect a claim of immunity against self incrimination?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3886.05,3889.109,"Oh, he must definitely respect the claim."
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3894.882,3895.754,I thought you probably --
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3895.754,3899.104,But I thought Your Honor was talking about whether the --
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3899.104,3902.886,I did that was the question I -- that is the question I asked.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3902.886,3912.768,"In other words as I understand the question, and the judge here, Judge Arkwright, had not right to grant the witness immunity from prosecution and compel him into court."
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3912.768,3913.265,Yes.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3913.265,3941.457,"As a matter of fact for the benefit of such an inquiry as this, and because we had had up to the date of this particular proceeding, we had 60 witnesses invoke their privilege, 24 of whom were attorneys and these attorneys over the last three years or so had some 9500 cases and with their plea of immunity we just can't find out, we can't get the facts from these attorneys."
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3955.753,3956.887,Let me be clear of what you are saying?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3956.887,3959.002,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3959.002,3970.169,If a witness claimed privilege to keep quiet at an end of the inquiry that Mr. Justice Arkwright – Justice confronted in this case --
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3970.169,3970.919,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3970.919,3980.851,That is he is not given because the grant of immunity for prosecution is something else which in New York and other state is carefully guarded as to who can be given and who can't.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3980.851,3981.576,That's right Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3981.576,3986.587,"If this witness had claimed privilege not to testify, that would have been at the end of inquiry as to him."
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3986.587,3988.914,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3988.914,3992.875,"By claiming that it would incriminate him, is that --"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3992.875,3996.356,If he claimed that he would be incriminated by -- that would be the end of it.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3996.356,3998.661,"Well, that's not exactly what I was --"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,3998.661,4008.256,We could go no further and the judge repeatedly in this case has upheld witnesses who invoked their constitutional privilege against self incrimination.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4008.256,4008.556,Yes.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4027.998,4032.292,The judge wouldn't have the power to grant him immunity from prosecution.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4032.292,4034.051,"All right, suppose it ended right --"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4034.051,4034.99,We haven't got that right.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4034.99,4044.611,"All right suppose it ended right there, what would happen insofar as the witness was concerned, what would happen then? Would you proceed or would you dismiss the witness?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4044.611,4045.658,We proceed Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4045.658,4046.267,You would proceed?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4046.267,4046.763,We would proceed.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4046.763,4059.756,"In other words you would not recognize his demand that if he testifies, he is entitled to immunity, you would compel him to go further and claim his privilege against incrimination?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4059.756,4060.824,That's right Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4060.824,4066.402,But Mr. Hurley nobody can claim immunity from prosecution merely by asking for it.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4074.887,4075.333,That's right Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4075.333,4079.04,Witness can say Your Honor; I want immunity before I talk.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4089.794,4090.633,That's right Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4090.633,4092.451,As I understand (Inaudible) that too.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4105.618,4108.256,"No, he had to claim his privilege."
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4108.256,4113.573,I think Justice Frankfurter you and I are not in disagreement.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4113.573,4116.45,"He can't do that before a regular court, Mr. Hurley, can he?"
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4116.45,4118.261,"No, you can't do that in any court."
1958.378,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4118.261,4125.542,He would have to claim immunity and he would have claim privilege on each question that was asked no matter how many --
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4125.542,4126.576,That's right Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4126.576,4128.884,He would be in there without a lawyer.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4128.884,4129.925,That's right.
1958.378,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4129.925,4139.551,"Now you don't mean to say that do you, that by just refusing to answer the first question on the ground it might incriminate him, you would be let alone until you're going out?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4139.551,4142.285,"Oh, no we would ask a series of questions."
1958.378,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4142.285,4143.1,Continue to ask questions.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4143.1,4144.225,I continue to --
1958.378,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4144.225,4154.548,"Somewhat like it's done usually when a witness gets on the stand and they make him claim his privilege, and claim his privilege and keep on claiming his privilege."
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4154.548,4167.366,"That's right and then I have usually ended with a sort of anomalous question Mr. Jones -- as I take it from your answers, you are going to make the same claim with respect to every question I ask you."
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4175.377,4176.727,"Well, just as a matter, can we ask you –"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4176.727,4176.969,Yes Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4176.969,4189.02,Justice Arkwright or any other judges in New York allow you to go on and put substantially the same question which to his mind is clearly relevant to the claim of the privilege forever for hours?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4189.02,4189.203,Oh!
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4191.294,4196.263,(Inaudible)
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4196.263,4205.791,"Well, in this particular case without the claim of immunity, but claiming that he shouldn't be compelled to testify because his counsel wasn't in the courtroom."
1958.378,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4216.31,4224.917,You have the rule of New York that if a witness answered one question and he has waived all of the his right to protest to --
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4224.917,4228.707,"As to that, as to that particular matter we have the matter of waiving?"
1958.378,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4228.707,4230.853,Like the Rogers case in this Court?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4230.853,4236.75,"Yes it maybe waived, it maybe waived by answering relevant questions as possible."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4236.75,4244.798,Well Mr. Hurley have you had occasion then when a witness has answered and then later evoked the privilege to have the judge rule that he could not?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4244.798,4246.936,"No we haven't, we haven't had that."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4252.391,4260.331,Well in other words you have never raised with the judge the question whether in fact the privilege was available as to the particular question to the witness?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4260.331,4263.684,I don't follow you on that Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4263.684,4272.429,"What's your name, I plead the – privilege against self incrimination, have you ever challenged that to the judge at that time."
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4272.429,4279.556,"No, the judge -- the Judge Arkwright and now Judge Baker has upheld every witness the way they've invoked a privilege."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4279.556,4281.113,Without regard to what the question was?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4281.113,4283.376,That without regard to what the question is.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4290.429,4308.347,"While that matter is true, why -- why did they ask 16 questions in one case and 24 in another before the witness is excused or before a general question was about -- concerning his refusal to testify was given, why 24 questions."
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4308.347,4310.988,Well it was a matter of probably another 10 minutes Your Honor.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4332.329,4332.78,He left --
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4332.78,4337.698,Frankly I wasn't satisfied with the questions my assistant had asked so then I asked these others.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4337.698,4342.713,Do you let more than one person interrogate the witness in those proceedings?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4342.713,4351.243,"Only in this, only in this particular case, and in this particular instance where this assistant of mine happened to get sick."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4528.752,4531.334,Now those are only papers related to admission?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4531.334,4540.395,"No, admission of above and then it gets into and upon any complaint inquiry, investigation, or proceeding."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4540.395,4546.968,"May I ask there Mr. Hurley, I notice that the order makes provision for findings as well as recommendations?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4546.968,4548.098,"That's right, findings."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4548.098,4557.445,Would findings include the for example some finding as to witness or does findings relate only to findings as to lawyers under --
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4557.445,4561.293,We think both and judges have so acted.
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4579.001,4601.837,"Well does this mean this time then as to the appellants here, there might be finding say that they were dropped in someway, are those findings under Section 10 might be released at the discretion of the appellate division even though they may never have been prosecuted for the crimes suggested by the findings?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4601.837,4616.815,"Yes that's -- you see the duty of the judge and my duty I think this answers another question of the court, our job ends when judge, when the judge reports his proceedings, his findings and his recommendations."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4662.77,4675.866,When you said for a criminal investigation did I correctly understand that maybe that on the basis of the findings and evidence alone there could be a prosecution and information without further criminal investigation?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4675.866,4698.888,"I don't concede -- I don't understand it that way Your Honor, because what we do, what Judge Arkwright does in this preliminary investigation -- he listens to the witnesses, he listens to the proof and the exhibits we give and when we are all through he sends out, he sends these the stenographer's minutes, the exhibits, he sends the whole kit and caboodle to the appellate division with recommendations."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4698.888,4702.537,Well now suppose the appellate division sends as you say the package to the --
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4702.537,4707.484,Well then -- the appellate division has been very careful about what it does in these matters.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4793.486,4802.587,You interested me as an old New Yorker in saying that the district attorney begins -- conduct disciplinary proceedings and (Inaudible) New York.--
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4802.587,4805.944,"Oh, it's through the whole state Your Honor, under the --"
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4805.944,4809.06,(Inaudible) New York on the mechanism of the Bar Association.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4809.06,4810.354,Usually it is.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4851.044,4853.117,"You also have to balance a budget, do you?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4853.117,4853.566,Beg your pardon?
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4853.566,4855.162,You also have to balance a budget.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4855.162,4858.5,"Oh yes indeed, yes indeed."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4866.898,4872.299,"Well Mr. Hurley, have you a case in exercise or been given this discretion to turned over to the district --"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4872.299,4873.393,"Oh yes, we've done that."
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4873.393,4874.431,And you have done it.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4874.431,4874.73,Oh yes.
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4874.73,4880.185,"Now in those instances where you have done it, has there been an independent criminal investigation or have there been --"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4880.185,4885.584,Independent -- that's what I was going to say as to our limitations.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4927.682,4939.05,"The potential offenses, the potential that may arise out of your investigation are not so petty and casual that they do not require a Grand Jury proceedings, do they?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4940.349,4941.874,Oh yes indeed.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4941.874,4947.306,So that the District Attorney must make submissions to Grand Jury to get an indictment.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4947.306,4948.862,I was going to come to that.
1958.378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4963.353,4967.842,Not so if it's the kind of offense that maybe prosecuted under information though?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4967.842,4974.361,"Well, he could do it on information, but that's as to misdemeanors conducted on what we call our Court of Special Sessions."
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4974.361,4981.739,"That's what I meant these are not -- I'm not asking of that order, if there is a case, it's an important case, isn't it?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4981.739,4983.485,"We've tried to keep it that way, in other words --"
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4983.485,4987.797,Is barratry – is barratry an indictable offense in New York?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,4987.797,4995.018,"I think it is Your Honor, but I don't think I've heard it -- I've ever heard anybody indicted for it."
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5000.894,5004.841,(Inaudible) appeal to me Mr. Hurley.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,5074.635,5079.94,Well of course that question Mr. Chief Justice goes to the very heart of this case.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5079.94,5080.116,Yes.
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,5081.43,5083.123,It goes to very heart of the case.
1958.378,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5100.666,5101.973,You've got a package too haven't you?
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,5101.973,5111.774,I have a real package in order to answer my opponent and that comes down to answering the question of the Chief Justice.
1958.378,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5174.985,5181.916,"Now if you can't answer that question that I asked you, would you mind answering this one?"
1958.378,1,20955,denis_m_hurley,,5193.238,5200.181,Well the appellate division put that in the matter of Anonymous case as a matter of this discretion.
