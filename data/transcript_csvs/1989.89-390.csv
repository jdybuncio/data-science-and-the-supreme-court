1989.89-390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-390, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corporation."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,11.672,14.608,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,177.466,178.916,May I interrupt you for a moment?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,186.054,188.471,"--There were two reasons, Justice Stevens."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,206.718,214.872,"Well... this is what I really need some help on because the briefs somehow gloss over the facts, just as you did in starting out with the statute."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,225.179,227.029,"--In effect, yes, Justice Stevens."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,228.298,229.248,"Well, how could that be?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,238.237,247.093,"--Under the statutory scheme that Congress established here, PBGC doesn't pay all benefits under an underfunded terminated plan."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,262.972,263.872,Let me just be sure I understand--
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,263.872,264.288,--Sure.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.288,264.905,--just to get an example.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,264.905,265.288,Sure.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,265.288,279.731,"In other words, if there's a closed plant, the people qualified for retirement benefits because the plant was closed and they lost their jobs and they were getting pensions and then they... you terminate the plan so PBGC pays part of the benefits and the LTV finances the balance."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,280.516,281.499,That's correct.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.499,285.468,And now those same people will get benefits under the follow-up plan?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,285.468,286.085,That's correct.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,286.587,288.503,"Well, how can they earn benefits if they've already retired?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,289.872,298.478,"--Well, suppose... let's take a numerical example and suppose we have a retiree who was receiving a pension of, let's say, $800 a month--"
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.478,298.811,Right.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,298.811,300.995,--under the pension plan that terminates.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.881,306.399,Right.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,306.399,307.166,--of that $800.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,313.654,314.104,I see.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,318.808,319.724,It covers those people--
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,319.724,320.208,I see.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,320.208,327.914,--and it also covers active workers who might have had a vested benefit under the old plan in a certain amount.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.103,339.472,But you had to pay his vested?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,339.472,340.788,"That's correct, Justice White."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,356.581,357.266,"Well, this is what I don't understand."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,363.285,365.085,"Well, I'm now referring to active employees."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.153,369.272,"But then if they're active employees, they aren't getting benefits under the old plan."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,372.141,375.593,--The retirees would be getting benefits under the old plan.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.593,375.976,Right.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,375.976,376.526,The active--
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.526,378.795,And not earning benefits under any new plan.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,378.795,381.913,--And... and receiving benefits from the new plan.
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.913,382.363,I see.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,382.363,385.714,"To make their... to make them whole, substantially whole."
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.852,394.637,"Yeah, but you don't pay them anything because they didn't have a vested benefit and they haven't retired yet."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,394.637,403.093,"Well, if they... under most plans, they would have earned already a vested benefit, provided they had sufficient service."
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.814,409.18,I see.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,409.18,415.218,--and they are entitled to receive that vested accrued benefit... active employees now... once they reach--
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.218,415.718,When they do--
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,415.718,416.87,--their normal retirement age.
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.87,417.786,--I see.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,417.786,424.775,"So, they do... they do have an earned benefit under the old plan, but it's frozen as of the date of termination."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,439.333,445.439,"And so that when they retire in the future, the part that had vested you're responsible for, and the balance they will pay."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,445.439,446.122,From the follow-on plan.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.122,446.405,All right.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,446.405,447.039,That's correct.
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.039,457.247,"When... when you say that the PBGC pays vested benefits, you don't necessarily mean up to the full amount of the vested benefit?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,463.317,473.006,"It's rather complicated, Justice Scalia, but in most cases we would pay the full vested benefit at the time that employee reaches his retirement age."
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.006,473.772,Right.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,473.772,475.958,There may be cases where--
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.958,476.341,Nothing--
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,476.341,477.424,--even that would be limited.
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.424,485.414,"--Nothing vests but what PBGC would cover, by and large?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,485.414,488.266,"As a matter of fact, that's largely true."
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.468,491.801,Right.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,491.801,510.381,"--if an employee is already... or a retiree... is already eligible for a shutdown benefit at the time that a plan terminates, he will not receive the full amount of that benefit, even though it might otherwise be vested, because it will exceed the amount that we would guarantee by some fairly substantial amount."
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.381,510.681,Okay.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,538.365,538.965,That's correct.
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.901,544.203,"But in this case it was both, both the people already retired and the ones that continued to work?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,544.203,547.721,That's absolutely right.
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,673.737,714.814,"Ms. Flowe, may I ask you whether the benefit... Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation takes the position that it can order restoration based solely on the existence... coming into existence of what it thinks is an abusive follow-on plan or must it also include in the calculus whether the company can... can financially absorb the cost on restoration?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,714.814,721.051,"Justice O'Connor, the grant of authority under Section 4047 is unusually broad."
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,729.907,742.882,"Even though the company clearly cannot pay the costs, so that it's going to result in some kind of immediate retermination action one way or another?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,742.882,749.904,"--Well, whether the company can pay or not, first of all, does not necessarily equate with the immediate retermination."
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,756.391,772.751,"Well, I want to understand the position, and the position you take is it makes absolutely no difference what their economic condition is, that if there is an agreement to what you call an abusive follow-on plan, you can order restoration."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,772.751,782.54,"--At least where, as here, there is no significant risk that doing so would be futile because there might be an immediate retermination."
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,782.54,785.825,"Well, that just doesn't answer the question at all."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,796.949,799.318,We did have three grounds here.
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,810.44,817.88,"Well, what if we thought that that determination was not adequately supported on the record?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,823.95,825.467,"I think not, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,868.046,877.068,"Well, what standard for a financial improvement did the PBGC apply to evaluate the situation?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,877.068,890.459,"On the separate ground of the improved financial circumstances warranting restoration, what PBGC looked at was the factors that had led it to determine these plans in the first instance."
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,919.161,930.453,Did you consider whether the tax waivers that had been granted by IRS in the past would be extended in the future?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,930.453,936.857,"--We did, Your Honor, assume that in making our determination that they had the ability to fund at least for the short-term."
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,940.892,945.796,If that assumption were unwarranted would the finding be unwarranted?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,945.796,956.752,"--No, Your Honor, it would not, because if that assumption were unwarranted, their ongoing contribution obligation would have been a smaller amount."
1989.89-390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.832,987.29,"Well, if... if there were a waiver, would that affect whether or not the past due obligation was a pre-petition or a post-petition debt?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,987.29,1004.834,"--In our view, Justice Kennedy, a... once there was a waiver granted the amount of the amortization payment which was then... which would then have been due as a part of the ongoing contribution, would have been entitled to administrative expense treatment."
1989.89-390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1004.834,1006.967,So it would not be a pre-petition debt then?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1006.967,1007.786,That's correct.
1989.89-390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1007.786,1013.607,"If it... and if there were no waiver, would it be a pre-petition debt as to the '84-'85?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1013.607,1019.511,"At least as to the '84-'85 contributions, those would have continued to have been treated as pre-petition debts."
1989.89-390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1019.511,1022.963,Are there... are there circuit court authorities on that point to back you up?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1022.963,1024.096,There is not.
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.165,1036.871,So far you've argued this case as though there had never been a bankruptcy or any... any action by a bankruptcy court.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1039.638,1041.257,"We think not, Justice White."
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.696,1053.898,What was your standing in that proceeding?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1053.898,1054.548,We were simply--
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.548,1055.514,As a creditor or what?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1056.264,1064.437,"--We were... we were in fact a creditor, but we were there exercising our regulatory authority to say that these follow-on plans--"
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.437,1067.872,"Well, why didn't you appeal the approval of the plan?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1067.872,1068.574,"--Well, we did--"
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.574,1069.891,Of the follow-up plan?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1069.891,1071.241,"--Well, we did in fact appeal."
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.083,1114.5,So the bankruptcy court--
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1114.5,1115.719,--before LTV's motion was decided.
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.719,1118.054,"--The bankruptcy court really said, it's none of my business."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1119.071,1120.721,"That's, in effect, what he said."
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.721,1125.541,And what were the... why did he even approve the plan?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1134.211,1141.551,He was approving... he wasn't so much approving the plans as he was approving the expenditure of money to fund the plan.
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.551,1142.284,That's... yeah--
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1142.284,1145.519,And that was in the context of LTV's seeking approval of--
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.519,1148.037,--Did the creditors object to this plan?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1148.037,1149.406,--They did not.
1989.89-390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.66,1162.63,So this is really the approval of a expenditure of funds to meet corporate obligations?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1162.63,1164.332,That's correct.
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.176,1184.211,Why would your restoring the old plan cost the company more money?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1184.211,1191.483,"The... because with the... once they terminated the old plan, PBGC takes over all of the unfunded liabilities--"
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.483,1192.083,I've got you.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1192.083,1193.366,--in those plans and--
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.366,1196.72,"And when you restore it, you... you get out from under that?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1196.72,1197.67,"--Precisely, and--"
1989.89-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.67,1202.791,"Any money you've paid out is gone, I guess, but any continuing--"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1202.791,1208.361,"--Well, as a matter of fact, under Section 4047 these plans are restored to their pretermination status."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.384,1224.555,"--Yes, but even if... even if you had not restored the plan, would you not be entitled as a subrogee to get back your money, if they are financially sound?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1224.555,1234.393,We do have a claim under the statute for 75... up to 75 percent of the unfunded guaranteed benefits.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.393,1241.166,"Well, why wouldn't you be entitled to 100 cents on the dollar of the money that you had to advance, if they are financially sound?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1241.166,1256.176,"If they were financially sound and were able to pay each and ever creditor 100 cent on the dollar, we would get only, even then, 75 percent because that is the amount of the statutory liability under the law in effect when these pension plans terminated."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.526,1260.561,"I thought that was the amount you had to pay, but that's the amount you can recover."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1262.513,1263.346,--Exactly.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.346,1264.063,I see.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1264.063,1264.615,Exactly.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.076,1284.643,"Well, but that's... I know, but those are different companies."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1288.23,1288.863,"Well, that's true."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1289.413,1292.682,So you should get your 75 cents on the dollar back... eventually.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1292.682,1293.801,--One would hope.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.801,1303.59,"Well, if they're... if you're not, then apparently... maybe one of the grounds for... there's some tension between your position you can't get your money back that way and your position that they are financially able to handle the plan."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1303.59,1331.14,"Well, not necessarily, Your Honor, because our claim would be an immediate lump sum liquidated claim for the entire amount of that underfunding, whereas the company's obligation under restored ongoing plan is only to make each year the statutory minimum funding obligation, which in this case is more like $200 to $225 to $250 million a year as compared to our claim, which is for about $2 billion."
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.282,1346.067,"Well, you have a $2 billion claim but have you... you have not paid out that much money, have you?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1346.067,1348.602,We do... we have not at this junction paid out.
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.602,1350.47,And that's the total amount you are liable for?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1350.47,1354.188,"That's the present value of the liabilities, the unfunded liabilities--"
1989.89-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1354.188,1354.538,Yeah.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1354.538,1355.605,--in that plan.
1989.89-390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1370.098,1382.239,"But during the time you had the plan, did you have the... did you have the discretion to use the assets to pay current obligations or to use your own funds?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1382.239,1396.249,"Administratively, PBGC pays a part of benefits under terminated plans from the assets of the plan it takes over and it pays another part from the premium income that we receive from the premiums that the statute requires us to cover--"
1989.89-390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1396.249,1406.271,The statute says that when you restore the plan you turn over... back to the company any remaining assets and liabilities.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1417.328,1419.53,"--That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.64,1458.989,"Ms. Flowe, do... do... do I under your position correctly to be that it really doesn't matter about the tax waiver and it doesn't matter how these matters would be treated in the bankruptcy, even assuming the worst, that these plans would still have had enough funds in them for a couple of years to continue in existence?"
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1459.857,1460.657,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.367,1486.925,"You started off earlier by saying there were two reasons why the agency restored and you have been discussing the first, and the second one was the change in the financial situation."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1494.595,1496.614,They were independent grounds.
1989.89-390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.386,1506.003,"Oh, it may be."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1515.659,1520.396,"--In this case, it was an independent ground for the restoration decision."
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1520.396,1524.282,"Well, you answered my question just the opposite when I asked you."
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1531.871,1535.672,"Well, we did... I... I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor, I must have misunderstood your question."
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1535.672,1536.189,So which is it?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1536.189,1536.557,We had--
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.557,1537.274,Let's try to get to the bottom of it.
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1540.143,1542.778,--We had two grounds.
1989.89-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.319,1561.307,Was that expressed any place in the record or in the language of the order?
1989.89-390,0,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,1565.342,1568.877,I believe it is probably not apparent from the face of the order.
1989.89-390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.47,1584.805,"Very well, Ms. Flowe."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1586.957,1589.576,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.938,1645.913,"Do you... Mr. Kaden, you say then that even the abuse of follow-up... follow-on plans that apparently is cited by PBGC would not be a basis for restoration?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1645.913,1659.47,"--Should not, in the absence of evidence of financial improvement, be a basis for restoration, and we will... we will try to develop that through an examination of both of ERISA and of the competing policies of these other statutes."
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.621,1689.156,Will you find all of those requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1689.156,1689.573,Yes.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.165,1702.715,And you say--
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1702.715,1703.682,--of the agency's decision.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1703.682,1707.051,--And you infer from that all those four or five things that you just ticked off?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1707.051,1712.438,I think those four or five elements are ticked off in this Court's opinion in State Farm.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1712.438,1713.64,As prerequisites?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1713.64,1715.54,As... as the elements of rationality.
1989.89-390,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.159,1757.836,"Let me just ask this, Mr. Kaden, if it's... if it's true... I don't know if it is or not... as matter a law that a follow-up plan such as I think I understand now went into a place and if that's a sufficient reason for restoration, isn't the record sufficient to establish those facts?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1757.836,1765.823,"--If... if these follow-on plans met a test of abuse, and if abuse were a grounds all by itself in the absence of financial evidence--"
1989.89-390,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1765.823,1766.173,Right.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1766.173,1768.608,"--for restoring the plans, then that might be the case."
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.765,1786.403,"Well, what does it take in addition to just... just having a follow-up plan to be an abusive one?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1786.403,1802.531,"It... it may be possible, as the government suggests, that one can imagine a circumstance in which an employer and a union got together and said we're going to push our liability off on the government and we're going to create another defined benefit plan subject to the government's guarantee."
1989.89-390,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.317,1805.967,"Yes, well, I... I--"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1805.967,1807.083,--and that might be abusive.
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.083,1813.304,--I take it that the agency keeps referring to an abusive follow-up plan.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1813.304,1813.754,That's right.
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.04,1828.33,"Well, and if... if it was an abusive... if the claim is that it was abusive, is there a record to establish that?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1828.33,1829.348,Not in this case.
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.7,1858.951,On... on... on request?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1858.951,1862.336,--Not upon... they... they asked us whether we intended to fund the plans.
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.336,1862.753,Yes.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1862.753,1868.557,"And we said no, under the law we cannot fund these pre-petition obligations, nor do we have the capacity to."
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.557,1870.425,So you... and so it was terminated then?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1870.425,1871.759,And so it was terminated.
1989.89-390,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.769,1916.888,"Yes, but, Mr. Kaden, if I understand your opponent, they don't object to those feature of the plan."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1916.888,1917.24,"--Oh, no."
1989.89-390,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.24,1919.673,They object to the features that they're... they're helping to finance.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1919.673,1921.192,"Indeed, they do."
1989.89-390,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1936.818,1957.948,"Well, I think their abuse policy is based upon the proposition that it would seem a very strange intent for the Federal Government to allow your company to compete with other companies in the same industry who have to pay the entire pension benefits for your company to be able to give its employees the same benefits and have the taxpayer fund... fund 85 percent of them."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1957.948,1960.15,"Well, of course, Your Honor, it's the premium payer."
1989.89-390,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1980.397,1995.656,"That's very good and... and it seems to me the agency gave you a good... a good tool to respond to the strike threat by saying, look, if I give you these benefits, we're going to be back in the soup because the... because the fund is not going to continue to fund the 85 percent."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,1995.656,2000.994,"That... unfortunately, in the position that LTV found itself, that was not an effective answer."
1989.89-390,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.583,2015.154,"Well, what difference does that... what difference does that make as to whether or not there's an abuse?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2039.935,2042.637,Not... not in the absence of evidence of financial improvement.
1989.89-390,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2043.487,2044.339,"Well, no, no."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2047.625,2052.76,--The definition of abuse has to include meeting your contractual obligations.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.866,2093.016,Where... in what circuit where you litigating?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2093.016,2095.284,We were litigating in the Second Circuit.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.284,2097.187,Had the Second Circuit decided the question?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2097.187,2108.328,"Second Circuit had not had an occasion, but our opinion was that that was a sound claim because, indeed, the contract has a life separate and apart from the mechanism of funding that constitutes the pension plan."
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.328,2116.582,And you... and you're saying that was a justification for fobbing off 85 percent of your liabilities under the other premium payers from other companies?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2116.582,2119.084,We... we couldn't fob off those liabilities.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.158,2131.71,But what is the--
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2131.71,2132.976,In the absence of the steelworkers--
1989.89-390,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2132.976,2135.978,--But what is the difference whether or not you had to do and whether you chose to do it?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2144.084,2151.588,--It depends on the structure of the statute and whether Congress ever contemplated this theory of abuse.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.741,2218.799,"Maybe... maybe the members of the legislature didn't want to vote for that in particular but they were perfectly content to vote to... to let the agency use its judgment, as the text of the Act seems--"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2218.799,2219.216,"--Well, let's--"
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.216,2220.168,--they did vote when... when it was enacted.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2220.168,2224.786,"--Well, let's look at the question of how the agency exercised its judgment."
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2309.892,2311.861,But none of this was literally impaired.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2327.403,2327.887,"On, no."
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.067,2389.409,"Now, what would... what would the... what would the... what would you have to pay that you weren't going to pay... when they reinstated the old plan, what extra obligation came onto LTV?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2389.409,2402.134,"If they were successful in reinstating the plan, two things might happen, and it turns on whether the contributions are owing or not by a debtor in possession, whether they are pre-petition obligations or not."
1989.89-390,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2508.654,2513.723,And why is it that it increases what they can collect from 2 to 3 billion?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2513.723,2534.304,"--If the plan were restored today and then had to be immediately reterminated because it was out of assets or because the bankruptcy court found that a new termination was necessary to avoid liquidation, the only consequence of that successful restoration would be to manipulate the recoveries in that... in that fashion."
1989.89-390,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2534.304,2534.921,"Well, why--"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2534.921,2537.756,We don't think the harmonizing of those three statutes could have intended that result.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2537.756,2541.458,"--Why, Mr. Kaden, does it go from $2 million to $3 million?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2542.343,2543.193,For two reasons.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2565.09,2566.975,So this is money they have paid out.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2566.975,2568.644,"No, it's not money they've paid out."
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.365,2607.935,"Well, but wouldn't they be entitled to some increase over 2 million just by virtue of the fact of the passage of time from the--"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2607.935,2613.256,"--No, because the size of their claim on termination is fixed on the date of termination."
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.266,2657.368,--Because they subsumed the gap that's--
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2657.368,2659.135,Not because they subsumed the gap.
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.07,2672.312,"--Of course, your... the... your opposition says that there... there is no assurance that they'd have to reterminate anything."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2672.312,2680.817,"Well, it... it... it is fact that cannot be disputed that the largest of these plans, the Jones & Laughlin hourly retirement plan, today has no assets."
1989.89-390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.437,2718.673,"What is your position as to the nature of the liabilities, the shortfall for '84 and '85?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2724.977,2725.429,No.
1989.89-390,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2746.926,2748.426,Suppose there's an IRS waiver?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2748.962,2749.912,Same.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2798.625,2807.147,You say... you say the agency has no authority under its mandate to itself determine that a plan is abusive if it can't show that it violates some other law?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2807.147,2807.731,"No, no, no."
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.735,2814.201,"Well, abuse--"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2814.201,2815.085,--and the plan will disappear.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2815.085,2818.103,"--Well, do you mean it has to point to a provision of its statute?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2818.103,2818.405,No.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2846.689,2847.506,"Well, maybe they... maybe they--"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2849.224,2855.295,I'm not... I'm not suggesting that they... they are not limited to that remedy if they can show evidence of financial improvement.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.471,2878.91,"Well, it seems to me you give very little discretion to the agency and it seems to me you can read the agency's statute quite differently than you do to give them considerably more discretion."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2878.91,2891.551,I... I don't think you read 4047 differently in the context of the financial improvement provisions of the terminations standards and in the context of these competing mandates of other statutes.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2891.551,2895.205,"Well, doesn't the very financial provision section also say other reasons?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2895.205,2896.605,Other factors in--
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.605,2896.905,Other factors?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2896.905,2898.074,--in the context in which appears.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.837,2921.689,Wouldn't that be financial improvement?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2927.158,2927.943,"Well, I'm not sure."
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2930.978,2931.828,"I'm trying to, and I--"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2931.828,2932.345,"--No, my--"
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.345,2934.597,--I think another factor means a factor other than financial improvement.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2934.597,2937.982,"--No, because the phrase is financial turnaround not financial improvement."
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.982,2938.682,Financial turnaround.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2938.682,2947.587,"Financial turnaround and other factors in the context of the whole statute, and in view of these competing policies, I would suggest means other financial factors."
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.587,2957.11,"Mr. Kaden, the... the argument you were just making assumes that... that the agency is saying... maybe they picked the wrong word by calling it an abusive follow-on plan."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2962.664,2963.03,Well--
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.03,2968.401,--district court to prevent any more than they could... any more than they would say that a financial turnaround is illegal.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2968.401,2969.118,"--Well, I would suggest--"
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.118,2969.786,"I mean, it's perfectly lawful--"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2969.786,2970.22,--Yeah.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.22,2975.174,--but it's... the... the issue isn't whether its illegal but whether it is a valid reason for the agency to terminate the plan or to--
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2975.174,2976.19,Or to restore the plan.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.19,2976.657,--Yeah.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,2976.657,2990.616,"I... I would suggest, though, that in view of the environment in which this decision takes place... plans once terminated because the company could not afford them... we are now fencing off that part of the case and looking solely at the replacement benefits."
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.43,3014.465,"Well, just... just strike the adjective abusive."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,3029.991,3031.26,That was their decision.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.542,3058.244,What if it was a mandatory termination?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,3063.03,3063.546,No.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.609,3084.226,I'm... I'm not sure we understand each other.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,3095.334,3095.717,The only--
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.717,3100.071,--and then what they call an abusive follow-on plan comes up?
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,3100.071,3107.308,--The only circumstance where a mandatory termination by them can take place is in the event there are no assets in the plan.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.369,3256.273,"I bet you don't agree, Mr. Kaden, that the agency's reasons were independent rather than cumulative?"
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,3256.273,3259.058,I think they've made clear that... that the reasons are independent.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.677,3269.163,"I know you... I know you argue that as a matter of law, but let's assume I disagree with you as a point of law."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,3275.334,3276.4,They were independent reasons.
1989.89-390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.4,3276.852,Okay.
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,3276.852,3282.673,"Their position is that abuse by itself justifies restoration, and for the reasons I've indicated, we disagree with that."
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.019,3354.736,"Thank you, Mr. Kaden."
1989.89-390,1,34701,lewis_b_kaden,,3354.736,3356.554,--the case should be remanded.
1989.89-390,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.554,3359.69,Ms. Flowe you have three minutes remaining.
1989.89-390,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3359.69,3360.623,May it please the Court:
1989.89-390,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3392.461,3395.346,Does one of the plans now have no assets in it?
1989.89-390,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3395.346,3397.146,"--That is incorrect, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-390,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3467.71,3468.693,Why is that any good?
1989.89-390,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3510.887,3513.22,"--I'm not sure I understand, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-390,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3544.958,3551.362,"You don't think a union will think, boy, if I let them terminate, the fund will pay 85 percent of all the pensions in the future?"
1989.89-390,2,18893,carol_connor_flowe,,3556.681,3572.591,"--Again, if follow-on plans are off the table, in the agency's experienced judgment in this area no arrangement other than follow-on plans, which replicate the terminated pension plan, have proven to be as satisfactory to employees generally."
1989.89-390,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3584.683,3585.666,"Thank you, Ms. Flowe."
