2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.436,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-320, Davis v. The Federal Election Commission."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,8.186,22.57,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This case involves the constitutional question of whether the government may regulate the personal spending of a candidate on behalf of his own campaign.
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,59.711,66.192,There is no restriction whatsoever on the wealthier candidate.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,67.271,68.831,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,89.713,98.46,"Well, what if, for example, somebody takes out a television ad that says smoking this type of cigarette is actually, is not harmful to you."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,103.692,106.113,"Of course, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,106.113,116.859,So governmental responses to the exercise of free speech are not automatically... don't automatically burden the exercise of that speech.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,116.859,118.625,"That is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,118.625,125.558,"Well then, why does it burden it for the government to make it easier for private citizens to respond to that speech."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,125.558,133.431,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's making it easier for a self-financed candidate's opponent to respond to that speech."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.662,144.348,"Mr. Herman, can the government respond to political speech?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,158.045,160.17,"Absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.17,161.154,Isn't that a distinction here?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,161.154,161.716,Yes.
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,161.716,163.652,What case supports that proposition?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,163.652,166.792,That the government cannot take--
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,166.792,168.776,Government can't engage in political speech.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,168.776,173.976,"--Your Honor, Buckley is on... there is not anything--"
2007.07-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.976,175.506,How is the government speaking?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,210.134,214.912,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I can't concede that, and this is the reason why."
2007.07-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,228.782,231.359,Has it done it?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,237.653,240.075,"--We have very little experience under the statute, Justice--"
2007.07-320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,240.075,245.229,Well your clients... wasn't your client's latest filing that he intended to spend a million dollars.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,245.229,246.634,--For the 2006 campaign?
2007.07-320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,246.634,247.447,I think that's--
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,247.447,248.384,That is correct.
2007.07-320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,248.384,249.664,--So it didn't deter him.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,262.628,266.548,"Well, Justice Souter, in fact it did deter my client."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.578,285.822,Do we usually evaluate restrictions on First Amendment rights on the basis of whether the chill that was imposed by the government was actually effective in stifling the right?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,285.822,287.305,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.305,294.38,"If the person goes ahead and speaks anyway, is he estopped from saying that the government was chilling his speech nonetheless?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,294.38,295.802,"Absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.802,297.036,Isn't that's what's going on here?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,297.036,297.989,Absolutely.
2007.07-320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,297.989,303.613,Don't we expect a chill argument to at least have a ring of plausibility?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,314.499,324.697,"Justice Souter, respectfully, I don't think that you can categorically say that it did not deter my client when he was outspent by $3 million in that campaign."
2007.07-320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,327.711,335.881,"You mean if the... if the other side had not had an enhanced spending capacity, your client would then have spent $2 million?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,335.881,339.347,"--Your Honor, he actually did spend $2 million."
2007.07-320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,339.347,352.577,"Whatever it is, I mean are you saying that if the... if the client... if the opposing party had not had an enhanced spending capacity your client would have spent even more?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,352.577,353.749,Potentially.
2007.07-320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,353.749,361.057,"That seems to substantiate the, at least the ostensible basis for this statute."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,361.057,384.47,"Your Honor, if the basis for the statute is to, quote unquote, $1.4 million even though he had already outspent my opponent by $3 million."
2007.07-320,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,384.47,393.764,Is there any reason to think that this statute will have any greater or different effect of Mr. Davis in the upcoming election than it did in the last election?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,393.764,396.153,"There is, Justice Alito."
2007.07-320,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,396.153,396.528,Why?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,396.528,417.394,"Because his incumbent opponent from the last two elections has announced his retirement and so Mr. Davis will now be facing very likely primary challengers, and then if he were to prevail in the primary he'll be meeting a non-incumbent challenger in the general election as well."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.635,455.879,"The government says that in fact more and quite a bit more incumbents went over the $350,000 personal funding limits than non-incumbents."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,462.893,479.667,"--First of all, the statistics here are incomplete because basically the briefing in this case was concluded in early September of 2006, before a lot of primaries occurred for the 2006 House election."
2007.07-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,487.272,506.125,But it was a four-year record and the numbers are rather startling that... is it 110 senators or representatives qualified for the enhanced contributions and only 6 of them were incumbents?
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.125,508.264,Yes.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,508.264,517.777,--The other number that was cited is that only 2 of 60 incumbents actually triggered the Millionaires' Amendment in those--
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.777,523.741,"Of course, that could mean that the millionaires have already been elected and are now pulling up the ladder after them."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,525.039,527.553,"--That's certainly our argument, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.553,527.99,Right.
2007.07-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.99,546.312,"Well, if that's so, one of the reasons that has been given for this statute is that it encourages the parties to favor the wealthier candidates; it deters people who are non-affluent but highly meritorious."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,571.943,600.369,"Justice Ginsburg, I believe that the... the fact that the statute expands the supposedly anti-corruptive $2300 to $6900 and allows a national party to make coordinated communications of an unlimited amount in response to the, what Buckley called ""ameliorative speech"" by a self-financer, would also increase the perception that... that our candidates are there to be bought."
2007.07-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.521,629.717,"But I thought... I thought your brief... and correct me if I'm wrong... said at one stage that there is... what Congress was driving at is a valid concern, but there are less restrictive alternatives."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,633.73,640.65,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I can think of one off the top of my head which is not this case, and that's public funding."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.316,694.019,But that wouldn't level the playing field.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,705.108,706.249,"--No, Your Honor--"
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.249,706.843,Well then--
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,706.843,717.416,--But this Court's analysis in Buckley... the public funding analysis in Buckley does not center on leveling the playing field or providing equality for all candidates.
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.196,723.57,"--Do you think that's a valid constitutional objective, to level the playing field?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,723.57,724.023,--I--
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.023,730.629,Do you think we should trust our incumbent senators and representatives to level the playing field for us?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,731.691,733.254,"--Absolutely not, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,761.836,782.546,"But isn't there something different between what the statute was at the time of Buckley, that a lid on, you can't spend more than X amount of money, and a statute that says we're going to let you spend, the sky is the limit for you, but we're going to give a boost to your opponent?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,782.546,790.044,"Justice Ginsburg, in Buckley there... there was no lid on personal expenditures."
2007.07-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.589,804.538,I'm talking about the statute as it was originally enacted by Congress did have expenditure limits and this Court said that was no good.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,816.394,818.096,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-320,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,849.365,863.485,"Even if... even if leveling the playing field is not generally a compelling or maybe even a permissible interest, is it a stronger interest when one of the reasons why the playing field is not level is other action that Congress has taken?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,887.818,899.751,"--Justice Alito, leveling the playing field is... I'm not quite sure how Congress would start to do that without implicating their own interest."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.575,925.819,"What we're talking about in leveling the playing field, I guess, is leveling the amount of speech that each side has, to make sure that each side has the same amount of speech."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,927.412,931.239,"Well, it's an attempt to do that."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.799,977.424,Are we... are we talking wealthy people here?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,986.529,994.338,It certainly is in this area and in many congressional districts in the United States.
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1017.08,1020.5,"You don't think that would be any more constitutional than this, do you?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1020.5,1022.172,"--I think it would be equally unconstitutional, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1028.545,1042.306,I'd like to ask about the provisions of the statute which allow the candidate who doesn't have the personal funds... what was the name of the challenger in this case?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1043.319,1044.664,Tom Reynolds.
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1044.664,1050.801,"Reynolds... to receive, is it, unlimited contributions from his own party?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1050.801,1055.221,He can receive up to 100 14 percent of whatever that OPFA number is... the--
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1055.221,1056.315,Yes.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1056.315,1058.159,--the purported difference in funds.
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.159,1078.293,"Suppose you had a statute which either explicitly said or has the effect, as this does, that the less wealthy challenger, the challenger in Reynolds' position, has more access and more support from his party than the challenger does from his party?"
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1086.228,1088.743,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy?"
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.743,1090.337,That concerns me in this.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1100.583,1106.628,"Well, again, Your Honor, if you're making a distinction... when you talk about the--"
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1106.628,1108.877,The statute makes that distinction.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1108.877,1111.218,"--Well, the statute talks about the less wealthy candidate."
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1111.218,1123.089,"And it seems to me that that distinction is somewhat questionable, and I'm asking you for your best statement of the theory as to why it's unconstitutional and your best case to show that it's unconstitutional."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1123.089,1140.254,"The best argument, Justice Kennedy, is that money and speech are synonymous in an electoral context, and it's inappropriate for the government to say that you, as the purportedly wealthier candidate, have too much speech; that that's enough speech from you."
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1140.254,1142.659,But you make that argument to the statute generally.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1155.232,1156.013,Well--
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1156.013,1167.947,"It seems to me that that's a particular vice of the statute, and I want to know if there is a formulation that's more precise than the general attack that you made... that you make."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1167.947,1169.523,--I--
2007.07-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1169.523,1178.801,Could you clarify with respect to that question two things: The party is not at liberty to give anything it wants.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1203.088,1203.901,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1208.867,1219.129,"But the party for the less well-funded candidate has the option to have much closer ties, much greater involvement, than the party for the other candidate; and that seems to me highly problematic."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1226.704,1254.24,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, if you refer to Colorado II, where this Court talked about the facts that... where this Court upheld limitations on party, unlimited party-coordinated communications, because that... allowing the party to do so would raise the possibility of evading the contribution limits."
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1264.143,1268.673,"Counsel, you said earlier that money is... money is speech in this area."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1277.811,1279.919,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1279.919,1284.058,So this law eases those problematic restrictions.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1287.869,1299.754,"It is less violative of the First Amendment, but, again, this Court has made the distinction between contribution limits, which it found was a reasonable burden on the Constitution, and expenditure limits, which... which are not."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1300.301,1302.69,It doesn't limit those restrictions on your candidate.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1302.69,1304.253,--It does not limit the restrictions.
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.253,1307.783,It simply makes the imposition of the restrictions uneven.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1307.783,1309.188,"That is, that is correct."
2007.07-320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1314.421,1318.388,"Well, but your candidate isn't subject to any restriction at all on what he can spend and his opponent is subject to less restrictions."
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1320.276,1325.338,"--He is... my candidate, my client, is subject to restrictions."
2007.07-320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.774,1329.429,Why can't he go out and raise funds?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1332.74,1334.99,"--Absolutely not, Justice Stevens."
2007.07-320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.301,1347.188,Doesn't it prohibit... I thought it prohibited him from raising funds in the amount from as wealthy donors as his opponent can now go to?
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1351.187,1355.139,--The contribution limits apply to him as they would to any other candidate except for his opponent.
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1355.139,1365.072,And he cannot have the support from his party that the opponent can have from the opponent's party.
2007.07-320,0,16141,andrew_d_herman,,1365.072,1367.197,He cannot have the same level of support.
2007.07-320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1367.197,1368.617,Not the same level of support.

2007.07-320,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.106,1833.934,But it's in the statute and it's part of the challenge.

2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1872.683,1877.9,I'm saying that this record would not allow you to invalidate the statute on that ground.
2007.07-320,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1906.046,1906.998,But the provisions--
2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1906.998,1908.154,--some and not others.

2007.07-320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.002,1975.392,I thought that that's what a facial challenge essentially consists of.

2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2177.264,2184.23,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are other contexts within the election area where there are comparable disclosure requirements."

2007.07-320,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2250.254,2259.359,So wouldn't you think they would require more detailed and more expeditious disclosure of the associational link than of the self-funding?
2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2260.859,2262.093,No.

2007.07-320,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2601.815,2604.814,But that's any... any organization that engaged in lobbying.

2007.07-320,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2618.7,2625.12,So is there no limitation on the rationale of leveling the playing field throughout the First Amendment?
2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2625.12,2667.148,"No, there is... there is a limiting principle, and I think that, importantly, there is a limiting principle that's very applicable to this very context, which is I think if Congress went to the point where they weren't doing what I think they're doing here, which is not trying to limit the amount of self-financing, but using it as a mechanism here to identify particularly costly races where they should raise the contribution limits, if they went further and basically said we're going to give you public financing if your opponent self-finances, and we're going to give you two dollars for every dollar that your opponent self-finances, I think at that point as a practical matter the regime would operate as a ban on... as a cap, just like this Court held in Buckley."

I know not everybody likes to do that... but if you look at the legislative record here, you will see that both parties in this, the opponents and the proponents of this amendment, realize that they couldn't limit self-financing and that they were unlikely to limit self-financing because it's such an attractive option for parties and for candidates."

2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2745.164,2768.983,"Well, Justice Alito, what I would say is that what the relaxation of the contribution limits reflects is an adjustment of other interests; and I don't think in principle what Congress has done here is different from what a number of States do, which is they say for the race for governor the contribution cap limit is going to be 2,000; for State auditor it will be a little less; and for local representative it will be substantially less."

2007.07-320,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2835.283,2839.173,But it applies different limits to different in the same... to candidates in the same race.

2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2896.166,2906.739,"--But one of the prices of accepting the government subsidy in Buckley was to agree to limit your own financing of your own campaign to $50,000."

2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3182.503,3191.672,"If I'm understanding the hypo which we were just talking about contribution limits, because there are no expenditure limits, if I'm understanding the hypo right, I think that would still be okay."
2007.07-320,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.19,3221.425,"Well, why not?"
2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3233.874,3252.836,"Again, if I'm understanding the hypo right, I think you would say there that the candidate is effectively burdened because if you get to the point where you're past what I would call $2 additional additionally, I think at that point a rational candidate is not going to engage in self-finance."
2007.07-320,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3263.83,3274.106,"I would have thought all the arguments that you gave before, like the self-financed candidate wants to be able to say he doesn't rely on contributions and so on, those would still be equally applicable."
2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3274.106,3278.465,"--They would, but I do think the statute in practice would operate quite differently."
2007.07-320,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3284.056,3289.398,So it's not a... it's not a qualitative argument you're making but a quantitative.
2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3298.159,3311.78,"I would put it differently and say we're not arguing for a principle without limits, but what I would say is that we really benefit here from the fact that this Court found no standing for the challenge to the Millionaires' Provision in McConnell, and we have a record of actual experience."
2007.07-320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.78,3324.196,"Suppose we found... we were of the view that all of the provisions, that the benefits given to the other side here are bad."
2007.07-320,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3349.733,3350.546,May I answer the question?
2007.07-320,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3401.385,3402.151,"Thank you, General Clement."
2007.07-320,2,16141,andrew_d_herman,,3404.212,3405.806,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-320,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3433.341,3433.7,Where did the money come from?
2007.07-320,2,16141,andrew_d_herman,,3436.214,3437.48,--For his opponent?
2007.07-320,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3437.48,3445.492,"Yes, because he didn't... his opponent did not take advantage of the relaxed contribution limits."
2007.07-320,2,16141,andrew_d_herman,,3445.492,3451.426,"He went into the election, Justice Ginsburg, with about a $1.15 million war chest."
2007.07-320,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3452.318,3453.396,Because he was just a good fundraiser?
2007.07-320,2,16141,andrew_d_herman,,3454.566,3456.285,--He was a chairman of the NRCC.
2007.07-320,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3459.174,3463.938,Can you address Justice Scalia's question about leveling up and leveling down?
2007.07-320,2,16141,andrew_d_herman,,3463.938,3471.029,I would agree with... with my friend that we have no interest in leveling up.
2007.07-320,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3535.393,3540.329,"Well, it advises the other side that they should get ready to raise more money."
2007.07-320,2,16141,andrew_d_herman,,3540.329,3541.141,--That's exactly right.
2007.07-320,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3541.141,3547.731,"Well... I mean if you say all of the rest of the statute is okay, that's certainly reasonable."
2007.07-320,2,16141,andrew_d_herman,,3556.494,3557.26,Certainly.
2007.07-320,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3578.752,3580.361,Thank you Mr. Herman.
