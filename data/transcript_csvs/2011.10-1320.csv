2011.10-1320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.718,"We'll hear argument next in Case 10-1320, Blueford v. Arkansas."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,6.77,10.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,65.525,75.648,"Is that -- is that altogether clear, because she first said -- didn't she first say that the jury cannot agree on any one charge?"
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,75.648,77.833,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.532,100.982,"Well, that's the count."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,116.708,132.837,"With -- with regard to finality, Your Honor, I think that -- that the jury could have changed its mind, but I want to emphasize the reason I say that, because I think it highlights something very important that is conspicuously absent here; and three brief points on that, Your Honor."
2011.10-1320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.877,147.596,Excuse me.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,152.714,155.683,"--No, that was -- well, that's my second--"
2011.10-1320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.683,156.785,She was announcing a vote.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,156.785,158.185,--Yes.
2011.10-1320,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,203.581,205.683,I think you've conceded away your case when you say that.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,245.26,251.33,Because the -- the reason why I think the announcement was an acquittal here is twofold.
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,273.093,282.183,"Suppose -- suppose the court said, after this colloquy, I want you to go back and think about this whole case again."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,285.635,286.587,Well--
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.587,287.553,--the capital murder count?
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,287.553,291.372,"--Your Honor, if -- if the jurors had come back and said--"
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,291.372,292.574,No.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,294.141,294.757,--Yes.
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,294.757,298.478,And the judge said I want you to deliberate more about this entire case.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,302.597,303.947,Oh.
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,316.42,327.144,"Nothing -- nothing -- Arkansas law doesn't permit the jury to -- before it's delivered its final formal verdict, to think about the case again and vote on it again?"
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,327.144,327.561,--No.
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,343.037,347.057,"Well, but I -- I think this may be what Justice Alito asked."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,352.611,353.345,--Well--
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,353.345,356.813,"It's mid-deliberation, as Justice -- as Justice Scalia said at the outset."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,356.813,362.301,--There -- there is nothing in the jury statement at all that suggested that it was tentative.
2011.10-1320,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,366.955,368.121,"Counsel, one--"
2011.10-1320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.121,369.355,But then they went out again.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,369.355,370.323,Pardon me?
2011.10-1320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.323,371.407,And that's the problem.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,414.936,424.207,The -- the defense counsel asked for verdict forms to be sent into the jury room that would allow them to record their verdicts on the murder charges.
2011.10-1320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.265,438.884,"But that -- so long as it's still tentative thoughts, it doesn't matter."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,469.486,471.688,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
2011.10-1320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.688,479.544,So there is no certainty whatever that -- that what was the vote at that time would be the vote when they finally got done.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,479.544,493.971,"Well, but, Your Honor, on the record as the case comes to this Court, what you have is this very clear and explicit statement against guilt on the murder charges, and then nothing in what the jury says when it comes back that contradicts that."
2011.10-1320,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,493.971,494.538,"Well, at this point--"
2011.10-1320,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,494.538,512.015,"--Counsel, I thought that part of your argument was that, given the instructions in this case, which the jury appears to have followed to the T, they can't get to a lesser count unless they have acquitted on the preceding count."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,512.015,512.399,Yes.
2011.10-1320,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,512.399,517.586,"When the judge asks them, did you reach criminal negligence, they say: We were told not to."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,555.961,567.852,"Yes, I think that's exactly right, Your Honor, because the jury instructions very explicitly said that you don't go to a lesser offense unless you have a reasonable doubt on the greater offense."
2011.10-1320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,569.786,570.252,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,570.638,584.378,"--I was just going to say, the State over and over again in its closing argument said to the jury: You cannot reach a lesser offense unless you unanimously find the defendant not guilty on the greater offense."
2011.10-1320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,597.538,599.954,"Right, but that's the final say."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,635.127,641.031,"Well, the instructions don't provide for them -- for them to go back."
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,647.887,649.454,"Well, but then I'm not sure it's just a matter of State law then."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,670.9,684.394,"--Well, let me say, whatever one thinks about finality, and do I think there was sufficient finality here for the reasons we have been discussing, but whatever one thinks about finality, let's consider this in the context of manifest necessity."
2011.10-1320,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,708.175,722.602,"Are you saying that there was no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial as to any count, in which case there could be no retrial whatsoever, or no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial on capital murder."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,733.41,734.693,Okay.
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.962,818.581,What's bothering me is I can't figure this out very well.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,875.435,876.652,"--Okay, Your Honor."
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.222,886.341,"Well, you could say, well, could say -- well, that's one route."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,903.302,904.769,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.769,918.145,"So they make a mistake and now suddenly there's jeopardy, where it wasn't before, or -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the issues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what was going on in the room, particularly if it's changeable."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,918.145,926.399,"--With respect, Your Honor, I disagree that it's a minor matter when a foreperson stands up, with the jury present, and says we have voted not guilty."
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,943.76,945.546,"Okay, so let's -- go ahead."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,945.546,946.762,"But -- may I just finish the sentence, Your Honor?"
2011.10-1320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.908,1010.239,"Only if -- only if, and I think this is the premise of your argument, only if there is a constitutional necessity to, to sever the various charges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the jury come in on one charge without coming in on the other."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1015.809,1022.979,"--Well, Your Honor, first, on the manifest necessity point, when there is an announcement like this, because--"
2011.10-1320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.979,1038.306,"Your manifest necessity depends upon the necessity of severing, yes, if you sever then there is no manifest necessity of resubmitting the greater charge."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1042.543,1061.771,"--The -- the manifest necessity argument is that when there is an announcement like this that goes right to the core of double jeopardy -- and, you know, we know that with greater and lesser included offenses, if there is a basis for an acquittal, then that has to be given effect on the separate charges."
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1063.123,1064.706,But that's -- but that's after a verdict.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1110.187,1111.22,"Well, because--"
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1111.22,1117.008,What -- what purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated by the rule that says you can't go back?
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1117.008,1122.078,"--Well, Your Honor, on the manifest necessity point, I'm not saying you can't get back."
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1130.416,1132.618,I'm asking why it's the heartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1132.618,1133.084,--Because this Court--
2011.10-1320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.084,1133.97,I question that.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1133.97,1135.62,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1150.495,1150.979,"Why ""surely""?"
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1150.979,1151.514,--Pardon?
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.514,1152.047,"I mean, why?"
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1175.713,1176.797,Okay.
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.717,1183.818,"No, I'm not assuming anything."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1184.852,1185.718,"--What -- no, no -- it's just what I'm saying."
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.354,1190.072,Yes.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1190.072,1191.356,And here--
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.356,1191.839,What is the answer?
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1191.839,1196.46,"--there's -- I would say definitely, yes, in a hard transition State."
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.576,1207.851,"In the State I imagine is -- remember, there were three possible verdicts -- acquit of everything, convict of something, or say you're hung."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1215.355,1215.772,--Right.
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1215.772,1216.374,Okay?
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1230.114,1233.049,"He does, if--"
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.049,1233.835,He does?
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1233.835,1236.787,"--Yes, if it is a hard transition State."
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1240.072,1241.189,I don't know what -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1241.189,1241.539,Okay.
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1252.13,1252.397,Okay.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1254.013,1266.487,"--And every State court, except for Arkansas here, that has addressed the issue in the context of a hard transition, has said that the defendant does have a right to inquire--"
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1266.487,1266.754,"--Okay, okay."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1266.754,1268.689,--That's very different if you don't have that kind of hard transition.
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.689,1271.975,"I'm only midway, because I'm trying to follow this through."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1297.375,1301.427,So after -- after they have announced an acquittal?
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1301.427,1302.11,No.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1307.998,1308.364,Right.
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1308.364,1311.802,"Foreman: ""Number five, Your Honor""."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1333.398,1337.667,"Well, no; I -- look, I think there can be variations in State procedure, but I think the core--"
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.667,1338.05,"No, no."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1359.298,1360.065,--Well--
2011.10-1320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1360.065,1363.15,"But there is a lot of stuff I haven't heard of, so that doesn't prove that much."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1363.15,1368.721,"--Well, there are several States that have this, and the reason--"
2011.10-1320,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1368.721,1371.44,"Counsel, what do several States have?"
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1432.345,1434.164,--That's exactly right.
2011.10-1320,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1443.319,1447.488,"Well, our case in Ball says it doesn't matter whether a judgment is entered or not."
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1474.741,1475.541,--Yes.
2011.10-1320,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1476.441,1484.613,And I thought I heard you arguing that here the lack of manifest necessity was that the judge had heard they reached that verdict.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1484.613,1485.729,Well--
2011.10-1320,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1485.729,1494.552,And he should not have discharged the jury without asking them could they reach a verdict that -- had they reached the verdict that they announced.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1494.552,1495.071,--Yes.
2011.10-1320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.769,1525.673,You've talked about our manifest necessity decisions.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1535.046,1538.398,"In the face of a jury deadlock, is what Your Honor is talking about."
2011.10-1320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.398,1538.981,Yes.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1538.981,1542.699,"Yes, this Court has emphasized the -- the deference due a district court."
2011.10-1320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1543.383,1544.566,And under that -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1545.135,1551.622,--Renico did not present the important threshold issue about what are the charges on which the jury is deadlocked.
2011.10-1320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.16,1572.452,"I don't want to -- I'm sorry for taking up your time, but your friend says you did not object when the judge announced that he was going to declare a mistrial; is that correct?"
2011.10-1320,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1572.452,1582.074,"Your Honor, there's not an -- an objection at that time, but that is not a waiver for a couple of reasons."
2011.10-1320,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1612.826,1614.109,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,1616.295,1620.599,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1320,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1632.171,1634.157,Where does it say that in the jury charge?
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,1634.157,1647.499,"--I think that there is a critical misunderstanding by Petitioner of Arkansas's jury instructions, and there is a lot of use of -- of titles, such as ""acquittal first"", or ""hard transition"" or ""soft transition""."
2011.10-1320,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1647.499,1658.271,"Well, as I understand what the Arkansas instructions said, what the instructions in this case said, is that the jury unanimously had to have a reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down to the next offense."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,1700.265,1702.05,"Well, there are three primary reasons."
2011.10-1320,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1721.881,1724.75,The chief prosecutor kept saying: You all have to agree on this.
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,1724.75,1730.319,"--And he was accurate, and he was echoed by the defense counsel in her closing argument as well."
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1763.041,1764.041,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.592,1819.977,"You didn't finish your answer, did you?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,1821.663,1822.529,--I did.
2011.10-1320,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1874.196,1888.772,"I think if you look at what the court -- the judge said, what the prosecutor said, what the defense counsel said and then what the jury said, it's clear that they all thought that they had to unanimously agree on something before they could go to the next crime."
2011.10-1320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.425,1898.211,Is there any suggestion that they couldn't go back up?
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,1898.211,1900.329,That is extraordinarily important.
2011.10-1320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.329,1905.65,Isn't it usually assumed that the jury is not finished until it's finished?
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,1905.65,1909.102,The state would assert that that is precisely the case here.
2011.10-1320,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1959.718,1968.74,"Even if, general, even if you're not required -- and if you are required -- but even if you're not, here the jury comes back."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2010.317,2012.4,"Well, there are a couple of reasons."
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2098.488,2104.944,"--For instance if they had -- if the judge had called them back in and said, are you deadlocked on the third count."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2121.804,2127.942,--Certainly there would be -- it would be a tougher case if everything ended at that moment.
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2142.301,2147.438,Doesn't sound like the judge was interested in any of the defense counsel's positions on mistrial.
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2163.733,2166.769,"And, Justice Sotomayor, they were rightly rejected."
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2181.944,2198.638,"So if the state rule says we don't take partial verdicts and the judge had entered a verdict -- a judgment -- declared a mistrial or entered a judgment saying hung jury as to all counts, would jeopardy have attached."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2198.638,2200.923,--If there is a hung jury as to all counts--
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2200.923,2201.556,No.
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2211.214,2212.031,--Correct.
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2212.031,2212.898,Jeopardy has attached.
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2212.898,2214.333,No.
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2226.39,2256.66,"So the only issue here is whether it's reasonable to conclude that a jury that has been told acquit first comes back and says, we're only hung on this, and the jury says, listen to each other on what your hung on, that that jury reasonably -- the judge could have ignored their stated verdict and entered a trial -- a mistrial on everything else."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2256.66,2261.044,"--Respectfully, Justice Sotomayor, they were not told acquit first."
2011.10-1320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.246,2267.531,"You don't agree -- I don't think you agree that it was their stated verdict, do you?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2267.531,2268.717,I absolutely do not.
2011.10-1320,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2271.769,2277.239,"There's no room in Arkansas law for saying you're acquitted as to one, acquitted as to two."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2290.564,2292.999,"--Well, it's not up to the jury to determine--"
2011.10-1320,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.999,2293.333,No.
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2296.518,2298.486,"--That is correct, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1320,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2299.353,2309.294,"I guess -- General McDaniel, one question about what Arkansas law does is -- it seems a little bit as if it's trying to get the sweet of an acquittal for a State without the bitter."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2354.823,2356.691,"No, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1320,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2417.064,2427.704,"General McDaniel, in this case, they deliberated for 4-1/2 hours at the point where the judge asked them, where do you stand on this count?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2473.333,2481.172,"The State wouldn't venture to speculate as to what they did, although I would respectfully say that that is probably what happened."
2011.10-1320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.195,2510.608,"General McDaniel, how -- how probable is it that when the jury is polled, and having voted unanimously when they were back in the jury room, one of the members of the jury changes his mind and votes the other way?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2514.243,2514.727,--It does.
2011.10-1320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.727,2516.429,"And when it happens, what's the result?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2516.429,2521.583,It -- it bears all the difference in the finality of the verdict.
2011.10-1320,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2548.483,2555.32,Is this a fair explanation of Arkansas law which doesn't seem to me to be perfectly clear?
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2583.038,2584.156,That's correct.
2011.10-1320,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2584.156,2584.839,Is that a correct understanding?
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2584.839,2587.191,"Yes, Justice Alito, that's precisely correct."
2011.10-1320,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2615.359,2625.233,"For double jeopardy purposes, is the question what Arkansas law actually says, or what the jury understood Arkansas law to be?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2625.233,2636.708,"I think what Arkansas law actually says is how we should be judged, but at the same time, the evidence here was that the jury came in to answer questions about the status of their deliberation."
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2685.272,2695.211,"General, how do you deal with our cases, Ball, Martin Linen, and the whole line that says the State -- the form of State law judgments doesn't control?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2695.211,2704.167,"I think that Ball is particularly helpful to us, and I think that the Hudson case cited by Petitioner is also important."
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2715.074,2716.493,I'm not sure what that means.
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2739.59,2743.244,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think that your answer is contained within the question."
2011.10-1320,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2788.689,2804.616,"Mr. Sloan told us that it was the State that prevented the elucidation, because defense counsel said, judge, we can try to do what Double Jeopardy Clause says, not try a person twice for the same offense."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,2861.971,2868.291,"Some states do, in fact, give the opportunity to inquire into the jury's deliberations."
2011.10-1320,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2972.942,2981.464,"General, you mentioned Green and Price before, and those are the cases, of course, where there is a conviction on a lesser charge."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,3032.814,3038.4,"Well, in Green and Price there were verdicts, and in this case there's no verdict."
2011.10-1320,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3038.4,3039.169,There was a verdict that eventually got overturned.
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,3041.602,3052.81,You have to look at Green and Price in conjunction with this Court's holding in Brown in the analysis of lesser included offenses within a general offense.
2011.10-1320,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3107.795,3122.638,"In Green and Price, the defendants were tried once on the greater offense, and jeopardy terminated without a finding of manifest necessity regarding the termination of jeopardy."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,3148.789,3159.93,"Well, and I think that's correct, and I think that there has to be some question here as to, is it an implied acquittal or was it an express verdict?"
2011.10-1320,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3211.796,3215.998,"--Well, what if she had asked, so why was it necessary for her to repeat it?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,3236.145,3244.251,--The primary difference would be in fact the possibility that polling may be different after another half hour of deliberations.
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3271.168,3299.569,"General, other than trenching on State rules that don't create the constitutional protection, what's wrong with a simple rule that says, once a jury announces that it is unanimous on acquittal of a count, you can't go back unless the jury says that it's not unanimous in some way?"
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,3302.671,3307.242,"It would be difficult to apply in practicality, and it certainly would be--"
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3307.242,3307.625,Why?
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,3327.321,3336.761,"--The primary reason why the majority of jurisdictions have rejected that analysis, whether it's announced or not, is the coercive effect on a jury."
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3349.735,3357.857,"I'm not -- I'm not asking -- I'm not announcing or setting a rule that says you have to ask them, you have to force them to give a verdict."
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,3383.408,3392.18,"So we're not asking, but if -- just so I understand your hypothetical -- we're not asking them, but if for fortuitously they happen to announce, spontaneously or otherwise--"
2011.10-1320,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3392.18,3393.58,That's what three State courts have said.
2011.10-1320,1,21195,dustin_mcdaniel,,3411.142,3420.015,"--First, this Court hasn't -- that court -- that rule -- could be allowed to work and, in fact, it does work in some states."
2011.10-1320,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.775,3435.626,"Thank you, general."
2011.10-1320,2,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3437.759,3440.578,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2011.10-1320,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3576.117,3576.617,"Thank you,--"
