1972.59_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.875,"This morning in number 59 original, the United States against the states of Nevada and California."
1972.59_orig,0,24831,griswold,,13.812,17.139,May it please the Court.
1972.59_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,76.02,95.994,"Unfortunately, Mr. Solicitor General, in the shuffling of papers, my map got lost if you will have -- if you happen to have an extra one."
1972.59_orig,0,24831,griswold,,100.754,114.043,"The map will show that Pyramid Lake is in the upper center, it is fed by the Truckee River which rises in Lake Tahoe."
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1850.032,1852.973,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1972.59_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1962.857,1969.197,How do the rights of the Indians Mr. Prettyman figure in this negotiation that you have just described?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1969.197,1982.485,"Well, in the first place, the Indians originally participated in the taskforce, withdrew, then submitted statements and witnesses in regard to the compact."
1972.59_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2056.313,2066.301,"The constitution provides the interstate compacts, it doesn't provide to best of my knowledge between -- for compacts between the States and United States."
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2108.641,2130.696,Well the compact will not become operative until Congress approves it and we think that in view of the fact that the federal government has been intimately involved in the development of the compact that the -- and in view of further of the fact that the State of Nevada is also concerned about the Indians rights and making sure that this level of the lake is at certain level.
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.784,2155.199,Do you any they agree with?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2155.199,2155.934,Pardon me sir?
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2155.934,2158.509,Do you have any evidence that Indians agree with this compact?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2158.509,2167.104,"Well, I think the Indians obviously would much prefer a declaration by this Court that they have a Winters right to x amount of the water."
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2195.111,2197.262,Sue against the compact?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2197.262,2205.803,"No, they would not be suing against the compact Mr. Justice Marshall because the compact would leave plenty of water in Nevada for their share."
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.479,2211.274,What I don't understand is that the fish has gone?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2211.274,2217.701,"Well sir, I beg a differ what if a fish, the United States has told the judge, it could sell or thrive it."
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.701,2218.834,(Inaudible)
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2218.834,2230.399,"Yes sir, the fish is thriving today because of great improvement in the level of Pyramid Lake and another things which are taking place there through the Secretary of Interior's operating criteria."
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.399,2236.809,"We know if we grant this motion we would have to give it to a master to find if fish is thriving, isn't it?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2236.809,2239.09,You undoubtedly would have to appoint a master.
1972.59_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2249.018,2250.767,"Well, it's been there how many years Mr. Prettyman?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2250.767,2253.679,Compacts has been almost 17 years.
1972.59_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2253.679,2254.872,"That's what I thought, 17 years."
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2254.872,2255.462,Number two --
1972.59_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.462,2267.35,"(Inaudible) approves the compact that's inconsistent with some Indian claim, I would take at the Congressional action would supersede whatever Indian claim might have existed, wouldn't it?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2267.35,2287.934,"If you were to take an extreme case where so much water was given to California that in effect obliterated the Indian's rights, I think that there would be authority to do that in the same way that you could takeaway a man's land through an international treaty with say Canada or Mexico."
1972.59_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.719,2310.604,Do you call it Winters right?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2310.604,2312.57,"Winters right, yes sir."
1972.59_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2314.584,2314.741,Oh!
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2314.741,2323.893,"-- Mr. Justice, where you have first discussed the fact that there was an implied reservation of water along with an Indian reservation --"
1972.59_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2323.893,2325.262,That's what you mean by Winters rights basically.
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2325.262,2326.179,Yes sir.
1972.59_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2326.179,2336.516,"Mr. Prettyman, going back to the vindication of the Indian's rights after an allocation is made of the greater proportion to the State of Nevada."
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2342.865,2345.006,Let me show you exactly how it would work.
1972.59_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.658,2405.217,But you do not suggest that there is any other court right now in which a suit could be filed and would settle this matter?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2405.217,2408.274,"We do, although I am not going to take the time to argue it here."
1972.59_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.579,2428.404,You took a more persuasive one as away from the two wait on the compact and then sue?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2428.404,2433.2,"Well our point is this that if you allow Congress to act, now what has happened here."
1972.59_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2439.686,2441.434,What has held it up for 17 years?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2441.434,2443.975,Negotiation on what the shares were going to be.
1972.59_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2443.975,2445.834,"Well, it hasn't been before Congress all that time?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2445.834,2454.358,"No sir, no no no it is only been before Congress the last session and this session that is the only it has been before Congress, all of these some 15 years --"
1972.59_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2454.358,2459.354,What is that Solicitor General suggested that senators of California would prefer?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2459.354,2463.324,Well there are two senators which have made statements on behalf of the Indians in California.
1972.59_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2469.21,2476.91,"Well I would suppose as a practical matter, if senators in one of be contracted states opposed there is no chance of Congress would approve it, is it?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2476.91,2482.397,We would hope that they would see the light Mr. Justice and particularly after you do not allow the --
1972.59_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.397,2491.045,"Well Mr. Prettyman planning the case would necessarily keep parties to the case, including the United States from settling it, would it?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2491.045,2496.073,Mr. Justice if you take this case I can assure you as a practical matter there are a number of things are going to happen.
1972.59_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.015,2774.982,Has the filing of this motion for leave to file interrupted anything?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2774.982,2784.902,"Well, it's -- in the first place in United States is not responded to Congress' request for comments, I am sure because of this case and won't until there is some decision here, that is number one."
1972.59_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2819.842,2823.353,"The compact is in a judicatory committee, is it?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2823.353,2825.122,Yes sir.
1972.59_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2825.122,2828.032,Does it go to the committee the -- the committees of both houses?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2828.032,2833.746,Yes sir it is a S. 24 and H. R. 15 at the moment.
1972.59_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2833.746,2857.875,"Mr. Prettyman if the special master were appointed at the some stage, not necessarily right away, if it's really could grant it, would this necessarily means that the special master would have to retread all of this ground or could he not draw on what the taskforce and what the negotiations have flushed out in the way of evidence?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2857.875,2864.139,Mr. Chief Justice in the United States District Court in Nevada there is a room full of records relating to Orr Water Ditch.
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2933.466,2935.25,Are you talking about ducks?
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2935.25,2935.625,Pardon me sir.
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2935.625,2939.886,"Are you talking about the ducks, you concerned about the ducks in the wet lands?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2939.886,2941.813,Well sir when you get the wildlife --
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2941.813,2946.688,Mr. Solicitor General corrected by that then it is all that used for always but that --
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2946.688,2951.803,"Oh no sir, you mean Newlands used ducks?"
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.944,2971.998,"Approximately how much is the wet land, it is not, what percentage would it be?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2971.998,2974.071,Well but it spill off sir its what left over --
1972.59_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2974.071,2976.438,Percentage.
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2976.438,2982.098,I am sorry I cannot give you the actual percentage but I tell you it is not the original use at all sir.
1972.59_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2986.656,2991.573,"That is typical with any irrigation, doesn't it, that you get a certain amount of run off?"
1972.59_orig,1,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2991.573,2994.098,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1972.59_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3030.901,3034.142,Mr. Walston?
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3034.142,3037.419,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.131,3195.031,"Well this -- assuming that nothing that judge Gesell ordered would be interrupted by the filing of this lawsuit, the filing of the lawsuit might turn out to be an unnecessary act but it would not -- it would be very bothersome, would it?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3195.031,3198.028,I think it would be Justice White --
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.028,3206.304,"Not in terms of whether the water would be available or not, if judge Gesell's orders were carried out as you say they could be?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3206.304,3229.117,"If judge Gesell's decision was carried out then Pyramid Lake would probably receive on the average about 385000 acre feet of water per year and this is all the Federal Government is really asking for on the behalf of the Indians in this case but it's very interesting Justice White how judge Gesell has approached the problem and how the Task Force approached the problem, really differs from the approach taken by the Federal Government."
1972.59_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3265.471,3268.082,They were not permitted any diversions for the Newlands project?
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3268.082,3273.053,Not according to the prayer and the government's complaint which I believe is found at page 14 and 15 of its complaint.
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.377,3278.677,I did not understand the Attorney Solicitor General to say that's what they were demanding?
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3278.677,3282.062,"Well the Solicitor General remarks, I think, very somewhat from his prayer."
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.069,3316.312,"Well, the solution of the problem is that so, and I would not say that they are simple but if you think judge Gesell has seized upon adequate solution, it should not be very difficult, it would not take if you are right, for even if this suit was filed, you mean even to arrive a similar result here or to dismiss it and leave it to judge Gesell's decree."
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3316.312,3326.101,"That is possibly true, Your Honor but I strongly suspect that if a Court takes the case, if this Court takes the case and proceeds the exercise its original jurisdiction in the matter, than the whole Task Force will come to a halt."
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.101,3337.741,"Well, not if -- I suppose you have taken cases in which we specifically said that we did not intend to interrupt a lot of other things going under the court in the same case --"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3337.741,3347.51,"Well that is – well then you are -- you are really by taking the case merely duplicating, this is our whole point, you are really duplicating what judge Gesell has already found and you are duplicating what the Task Force has already recommended."
1972.59_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3358.268,3362.252,Is any judicial review being sought of judge Gesell's order?
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3362.252,3364.211,No justice Brennan.
1972.59_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3373.26,3383.938,"Well your point is if we accept this case, that enforcement of judge Gesell's decree will stop, is that it?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3383.938,3388.797,"I frankly do not know how the Solicitor General will respond to judge Gesell's decree if the Court takes the case, I --"
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.797,3395.93,Well we are going to say the fellow who is under judge Gesell's order wants another solution --
1972.59_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3395.93,3400.92,"Two different groups within the department of interior, we are talking about, aren't we?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3400.92,3401.749,"Yes, Mr. Justice --"
1972.59_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3401.749,3404.336,"Conservation groups, we're talking about BIA?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3404.336,3405.169,Yes that's correct.
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3405.169,3408.232,(Inaudible)
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3408.232,3410.329,Yes that is correct Justice White there is the --
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.329,3412.565,"He is the one who is under order, judge Gesell's order?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3412.565,3413.495,Yes that's correct.
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.495,3417.329,"And he is the one who recommended the filing this lawsuit, I understand."
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3417.329,3420.959,"The filing of the lawsuit we are talking now, yes that's correct."
1972.59_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3433.111,3441.484,"You do not mean if the court applies, you mean if it is applied and enforced by the Secretary?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3441.484,3442.394,Yes that is correct.
1972.59_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3442.394,3451.765,"And what you are suggesting as I understood you was that we take this case, the Secretary will not apply to force judge Gesell's order, but it will wait on the outcome of this case, is that right?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3451.765,3459.367,"Well, I am not I see Justice Brennan, I am not sure what reaction the Solicitor General will take to judge Gesell's decision, if the Court takes the case."
1972.59_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3513.356,3521.855,"Of course Judge Gesell was limited, wasn't he, in that he didn't have the water users before him so that that was really the only approach he could take?"
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3521.855,3554.469,"That is the only approach he could take, that is right Justice Rehnquist but there is a sufficient solution to the problem, we believe whether it is justice or judge Gesell was in fact saying that there is vast amount of water which is being wasted in the Reclamation project, that the Federal Government has the power to control this waste, it has the power to eliminate the waste and if it follows these suggestions or the order of judge Gesell and the task forces, and makes the water available for use in Pyramid Lake then the whole problem is solved."
1972.59_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3568.564,3570.152,They were not before judge Gesell?
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3570.152,3579.519,"No, that's correct, Your Honor, judge Gesell just had the Federal Government before him and he ordered the Federal Government to adopt regulations which I think should solve the problem."
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3579.519,3582.487,Could they be brought in this suit?
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3582.487,3584.926,"They could be, I suppose that they could be."
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3602.494,3603.253,(Inaudible) didn't it?
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3603.253,3603.988,Pardon me?
1972.59_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.988,3614.379,(Inaudible) say that the admission of Montana did not supersede an implied reservation of water when the reservation was created just a year before?
1972.59_orig,2,33626,jr_roderick_walston,,3614.379,3615.039,That's correct.
1972.59_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3686.832,3687.634,Thank you Mr Walston.

1972.59_orig,3,24831,griswold,,3832.509,3833.758,-- that would be true.
1972.59_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3837.381,3845.343,"Well, with respect to the competing claims of Newlands and Pyramid Lake, these are intrastate stream."
