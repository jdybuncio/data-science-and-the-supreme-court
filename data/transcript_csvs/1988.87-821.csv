1988.87-821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.212,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 87-821, Pittston Coal Group against Sebben; No. 87-827, Ann McLaughlin versus Sebben; and No. 87-1095, Director versus Broyles."
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,20.712,27.068,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-821,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,181.318,183.603,True as for both B and C?
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,183.603,186.203,--That is true as to both B and C.
1988.87-821,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,197.344,198.946,The same kinds of proofs under either?
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,198.946,208.135,"--Well, the permanent regulations are different in some significant respects, and it would take a good long time to go through all the ways in which they are different."
1988.87-821,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.571,570.417,"Well, Mr. Ayer, one does get the impression at least that the over-arching purpose of Congress was to make sure that miners who would have been entitled to benefits under HEW's interim Part B regulations would be entitled to benefits under Labor's interim Part C regulations."
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,570.417,589.898,"Well, I think that that is certainly... I think there is a good deal of evidence for that in various parts of, if you pick and choose and you don't have to pick and choose too carefully, you can certainly find people who said things that indicated that with regard to the enactment of the House bill."
1988.87-821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.934,707.825,"It is not clear to me, Mr. Ayer, why if you prevail in your argument that criteria means medical criteria."
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,720.95,730.721,"Well, I think the words medical criteria, as has been indicated in the briefs, is not itself wholly unambiguous."
1988.87-821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.763,778.654,"But in any number of Social Security cases, especially in the circuit courts, the courts look at medical evidence to determine disability."
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,796.2,802.937,"I don't think, we are not advocating a reading that indicates simply there's a medical judgment involved."
1988.87-821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,802.937,806.389,You're advocating that it says medical criteria.
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,806.389,807.923,Medical test criteria.
1988.87-821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.923,808.258,All right.
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,810.274,810.558,Okay.
1988.87-821,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.558,818.462,And my question is why isn't that a large part of the judgment on disability anyway?
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,818.462,820.414,"Well, it certainly can be."
1988.87-821,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.268,862.991,"Mr. Ayer, the problem I have is I find the intent that you ask us to attribute to this statute a very implausible one."
1988.87-821,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,904.468,912.09,"--Well, I think what has to be kept in mind is that the Department of Labor was operating in the face of what were indeed competing signals."
1988.87-821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.019,1137.503,"Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
1988.87-821,1,36729,mark_e_solomons,,1139.138,1153.731,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, for the U.S. coal and insurance industries, the two central questions that are presented here are matters of fundamental fairness and economic stability."
1988.87-821,2,38313,paul_march_smith,,1744.377,1752.233,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.904,1848.73,"Mr. Smith, do you contend that if the Secretary did follow what you say was the statutory mandate and did review a claim under the guidelines, do you agree that that becomes final?"
1988.87-821,2,38313,paul_march_smith,,1853.766,1868.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, it the reviews had been conducted under the appropriate standards, and at that point the claimant had been notified that there had been a determination made that they didn't qualify, at that point I would certainly concede that their only appropriate relief would be an appeal."
1988.87-821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.451,1896.008,"Well, when you say meaningful, does that mean if the Secretary says I'm reviewing your case under the applicable law, but the Secretary makes a mistake as to the law, then they can start all over again say five years later?"
1988.87-821,2,38313,paul_march_smith,,1896.008,1905.447,"Mr. Chief Justice, what you have here is a situation where they applied precisely the same standards from 1972 which Congress had just identified as being illegal and inappropriate."
1988.87-821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.361,1931.431,"So you say in effect that the Secretary makes an error of law in reviewing, it's everlastingly open?"
1988.87-821,2,38313,paul_march_smith,,1931.431,1936.751,"Well, where it goes to the fundamental value of the review mechanism created by Congress."
1988.87-821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.751,1938.051,How can we tell that?
1988.87-821,2,38313,paul_march_smith,,1938.051,1941.703,"Well, certainly, you can look at the legislative history and the intent of Congress in the section."
1988.87-821,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.274,1951.511,So you say in effect in your answer that Congress said do it over.
1988.87-821,2,38313,paul_march_smith,,1951.511,1952.995,"Well, that's right, your Honor."
1988.87-821,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.63,1958.249,"That had been closed, if Congress hadn't said that."
1988.87-821,2,38313,paul_march_smith,,1958.249,1961.367,If Congress hadn't said reopen it?
1988.87-821,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3472.687,3473.739,"Thank you, Your honor."
1988.87-821,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3547.335,3548.418,"Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
