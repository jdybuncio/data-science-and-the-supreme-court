1996.94-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.026,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-1474, Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,9.958,13.77,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,75.743,85.508,"But it would not, as I understand it, be a decree that would estop the State if the State later wanted to contest the title."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,85.508,86.64,Your Honor--
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,86.64,87.211,Isn't that correct?
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,87.211,88.62,"--No, Your Honor, it's not."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,88.62,92.163,You think the State would suffer preclusion from that?
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,92.163,99.038,"Your Honor, by the very nature of these properties, it is impossible to separate the title from the possession of the property."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,99.038,141.237,"Well, yes, but in one sense it's always impossible to separate the officer from the State, but that's what Ex parte Young does, and I would have thought that the State's ultimate fear would be that if... if it had an ultimate fear, is that if the officers lost the suit, that the State would lose its title, and I would have thought if for no other reason than the very nature of the Eleventh Amendment claim that the State had, that there would be no issue preclusion against the State if the State either later wished voluntarily to litigate its question of title, or was sued in a State court for that purpose."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,141.237,146.44,"Your Honor, the very nature of this lands is what brings the difficult interplay with Ex parte Young."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,173.868,179.571,So you're saying it's the Quiet Title Act that would in effect require the preclusion?
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,179.571,188.717,--The Quiet Title Act would because of the language in the act that precludes an action by a State against the United States for lands that are held in trust for the benefit of the Tribe.
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,190.818,195.52,"No, but that's not the only way the State could perfect its title, is it?"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,195.52,199.304,"--Your Honor, that would be the only way the State could perfect its title in this case."
1996.94-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.304,204.596,"He could walk in and seize the land, I presume, send in the State National Guard and wait for somebody to sue to get it off the land."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,205.407,209.542,"Your Honor, the State would be bound to abide by lawful orders of this Court."
1996.94-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.901,215.834,"The whole theory is that that doesn't run against the State, it just runs against the State officers."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,217.346,219.687,--But the State cannot act but through its officers.
1996.94-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.059,234.215,"Supposing the State sends another crop of officers who haven't been named in this particular action, are they bound by the previous decree against the original State officers?"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,234.215,244.163,"Your Honor, the successors in office are the ones that would be bound by this particular order, but certainly they would suspect the tribe would immediately sue the State to enjoin those people from taking possession of the lands."
1996.94-1474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,244.163,247.366,Now--
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,258.863,261.995,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't understand the question."
1996.94-1474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,261.995,276.744,"Suppose Idaho... suppose the suit were to go forward and Idaho would prevail in this suit, or the officers would prevail in this suit, and it were held that the land had not been conveyed to the Tribes, that would work to your benefit, I take it."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,277.503,279.937,"Yes, Your Honor, that would work to our benefit."
1996.94-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.687,303.503,--You think it always operates in such a way that in fact the State is not bound?
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,319.031,332.882,"--You're correct, Your Honor, it is a fiction, and the fiction is that the suit can go forward because it doesn't unnecessarily interfere with the State's actions, but in this instance, because of the very nature of the title of these lands, it interferes with the State action."
1996.94-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.915,358.888,"So you're saying land and Treasury, land and Treasury we won't apply Ex parte Young?"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,358.888,363.139,"Your Honor, I'm saying in this context, sovereign lands is the same as the Treasury."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,383.134,419.436,"But can't you say in any case in which a State officer suffers an injunction, that the State officer is thereby deflected from performing duties which in the judgment of the State would be better performed either for some other purpose, for the purpose that it... that the... that was enjoined, and that there is always a kind of frustration of State activity as a result of it, and I don't... for that reason, I don't see why there is some peculiar status of lands, even when the State has a sovereign purpose in holding the lands."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,419.436,424.532,"Your Honor, these lands are identified directly with sovereignty of the State."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,427.403,438.79,"Yes, but the right to exercise any governmental function is identified with the sovereignty of the State, and yet the officer who is ordered by the State to perform that function can be enjoined under Young."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,438.79,449.216,"--Your Honor, if the officers are enjoined in this action, however, the nature and title... the title isn't in the actual ownership of the property, but it's the regulation of that property for the benefit of the public as a whole."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.182,480.778,"Well, it isn't entirely defeated if the State has, as I assumed it had, a right to contest the title in a forum of its own choosing, and therefore it seems to me that what the State is suffering boils down to the fact that if its officers lose this suit, the consequences of that may very well precipitate the State into having to litigate the title itself."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,505.252,513.14,"Your Honor, if the State officers are enjoined from the regulation of these lands, the point that I'm making is that the State does not have a remedy."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,515.419,516.578,"Well, you... let me put it this way."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,530.78,549.602,"No, Your Honor, because this Court cannot grant the relief the State would need to bring the action because of the Federal Quiet Title Act, and assuming that the Tribe was successful in obtaining possession, the argument would be made that our action against the United States, the actual trustee of these lands, would be precluded because those lands were held in trust for the benefit of the State."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,549.602,550.082,Okay.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,559.749,560.839,"No, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.202,567.353,Despite the Federal Quiet Title Act.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,567.353,569.756,"--Well, the Federal Quiet Title Act limits the State."
1996.94-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.756,576.659,"So it does not limit, in your view, the Tribe from filing a quiet title action in State court?"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,576.659,577.34,No.
1996.94-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,580.973,584.695,And the State of Idaho has waived its sovereign immunity for such a suit.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,584.695,591.58,"That is correct, Your Honor, that... our courts would be available to the Tribe to fully pursue in the entirety the relief that they are seeking in this action."
1996.94-1474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,591.58,602.906,What authority from this Court do you rely on for the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment bars adjudication of the State's sovereign title question in Federal court?
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,602.906,605.898,"Your Honor, we look to Treasure Salvors."
1996.94-1474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.448,682.028,"Mr. Strong, I understood you to say that this case is about where the suit will be, and Idaho has a State court remedy, a State court where this disputed question can be tried out."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,695.168,697.008,"No, Your Honor, our position would be no different."
1996.94-1474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.446,729.71,"So you're saying that Idaho has chosen to give the Tribe a remedy in Idaho's own courts, but doesn't have to, so we would be left with the anomaly, if Idaho hadn't consented to be sued in its own courts, of a dispute over title determined by Federal law, right, because both sides are--"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,729.71,730.13,That's correct.
1996.94-1474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,730.13,738.465,"--staking their claim on Federal law, and no Federal court could hear it, and a State court has chosen not to hear it."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,738.465,746.181,"No, Your Honor, there is another remedy that's available to the Tribe which also takes us outside the context of Ex parte Young."
1996.94-1474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,760.38,763.211,But that's up to the United States to pursue that remedy.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,763.211,782.794,"--Your Honor, that is correct, but the Tribe can petition the United States to bring an action on its behalf, and if the United States fails to take such action, and the Tribe believes that it should be taking further action with respect to this property, it has a remedy against the United States to bring an action, breach of trust action against the United States to force it to either litigate the title, or compensate it."
1996.94-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.794,786.848,Is there an action pending now which the United States has brought?
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,786.848,794.542,"Yes, Your Honor, there is an action pending in the United States District Court in Idaho, and that action is properly brought under Texas v.... United States v. Texas."
1996.94-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.675,820.52,"Of course, even if that remedy did not exist, as well as the remedy of suit in State court, which you say also exists, it still would not be a unique situation."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,828.595,829.887,Would not be--
1996.94-1474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.887,834.66,--because that's presumably the situation with respect to all claims to money from the State Treasury.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,834.66,836.179,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.212,857.483,How do you distinguish the old case of Tindal v. Wesley?
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,857.483,874.264,"--Tindal v. Wesley has been limited by the Larson case, and in that... what it basically says is that there has to be either an action by the officer acting ultra vires, Larson does, or alternatively that there has to be some violation of Federal law."
1996.94-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.966,920.646,"Well, but from the Tribe's point of view, I suppose if they have good title and the State occupies their land, they would be able to treat it as some form of inverse eminent domain, wouldn't they?"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,920.646,924.089,"--Your Honor, the State does not have an ability to take tribal land."
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.608,1022.341,"Yes, but if they're... if the Tribe is right on the merits, aren't they then violating some Federal rights?"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1022.341,1029.186,"Your Honor, if the Tribe is right on the merits there would be a violation of the Federal rights, but in this context you--"
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.186,1036.222,"It seems to me your argument is sort of proceeding on the assumption that they're wrong on the merits, an issue we don't reach until we decide the threshold question."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1036.222,1036.771,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.796,1074.246,"But isn't it correct... I know you say here there is both a Federal action pending where the United States is suing, and there's a State forum available, but if neither of those things were true, we had a different case, you would still say that there was no remedy here."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1074.246,1075.296,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.756,1077.619,So the Federal question could never be resolved.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1077.619,1087.214,"--That's the very nature of the tension between the Eleventh Amendment and the compact made with the States and the Federal Government, is that the States are to be free from suits that will interfere with--"
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.214,1089.878,"Yes, but with the exception created by Ex parte Young."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1089.878,1096.45,"--That's correct, with the exception created by Ex parte Young, but as I am contending today, this action doesn't fall within Ex parte Young."
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.646,1108.197,They're unlawful in the sense that they violated a supreme Federal law.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1108.197,1109.269,--That's correct.
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.269,1109.649,Yes.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1109.649,1112.29,And we don't know in this case whether there's a violation--
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1112.29,1116.492,"But we didn't know in Ex parte Young until after the case was tried whether there was a violation, either."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1116.492,1120.115,--But we do know in this case that there is a presumption of State ownership in that--
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.115,1121.667,Which is a rebuttable presumption.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1121.667,1132.574,"--That is a rebuttable presumption, but nonetheless it's a strong presumption, and the Court is required to begin with that presumption in any analysis of an equal footing conveyance situation, and given that presumption--"
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.574,1137.456,But isn't there also a presumption in the Ex parte Young area that State action is generally considered lawful and constitutional?
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1141.56,1171.02,"--Your Honor, the essence of what we're trying to contend before the Court today is that under Ex parte Young you start with the premise that a well pled complaint alleges a violation of some Federal law, a supremacy issue, and the contention we make today is that there is no Supremacy Clause question here, because if the State is correct and you are required to assume that the State is correct because of the presumption until it's litigated, then the State is acting consistent with Federal law."
1996.94-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.624,1184.736,I really don't understand why the presumption in the Montana case is any different from the general presumption that State action conforms with the Constitution.
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1187.799,1189.702,"--I understand, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1189.702,1215.248,"Well, isn't your... isn't the essence of your argument, I guess, and your best answer to Justice Stevens, if I understood you earlier, that Ex parte Young is concerned with a situation in which the plaintiff claims under Federal law, and the officers sued are claiming under State law, and here you're saying both parties are claiming under Federal law, and that's why Young doesn't apply."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1216.54,1218.941,"Your Honor, in part that's our argument."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1229.526,1251.021,"Well, yes, but if we understand Ex parte Young simply to be a means of litigating a claim of Federal right against State officers, then it would not in any way be dispositive that the State officers were themselves claiming to be operating consistently with Federal law, or to be claiming affirmatively that they had a Federal right to do what they do."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1251.021,1253.142,"Well, Your Honor--"
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1253.142,1265.08,"So I mean, that would be the end of your argument, I take it, there, and I guess my question is going to be, doesn't every defendant in an Ex parte Young case say, I am operating consistently with Federal law?"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1265.08,1269.243,"--Well, certainly a party says that in an Ex parte Young situation."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1269.243,1285.884,"Okay, so that the only thing peculiar about this case is that they're pointing, in effect the State officers here are pointing, or are going to point if they have to, to a title claim rather than to some other basis in Federal law to say that they are acting lawfully within the meaning of Federal law."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1285.884,1287.015,Your Honor--
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1287.015,1287.824,Which--
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1287.824,1294.43,"--what they point to is, rather than an assertion that they're acting in conformance with Federal law, is a presumption under Federal law that they are--"
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1294.43,1295.0,"--No, but that goes to the merits."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1306.426,1307.197,--That is correct.
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1307.197,1310.841,"And that is true of every Ex parte Young case that is ever litigated, isn't it?"
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1310.841,1317.125,"But, Your Honor, the Eleventh Amendment serves the purpose of protecting the State in the operation of its sovereign duties."
1996.94-1474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1319.327,1332.774,"No, it protects a State... it protects a State from being hauled into a Federal court under certain circumstances, and Ex parte Young says you can in those same circumstances sue the officer."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1344.14,1349.604,"--Your Honor, what you have here is property that's been identified as an essential attribute of sovereignty."
1996.94-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.428,1361.742,"Mr. Givens, you raise two questions in your petition, and you have had no opportunity yet to get to the second one."
1996.94-1474,0,19995,clive_j_strong,,1364.525,1366.788,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.075,1458.608,"Very well, Mr. Strong."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1460.178,1474.717,"Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court:"
1996.94-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1488.325,1494.789,What... the complaint is rather sketchy as to what these officers are supposed to be doing.
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1515.513,1524.56,"The short answer is no, there are no supplemental pleadings, Your Honor, and that's part of the difficulty of the whole case."
1996.94-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1553.07,1555.092,Is that set forth in the complaint?
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1555.092,1556.903,"In... yes, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1556.903,1560.476,I didn't see that.
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1562.737,1564.908,At--
1996.94-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.908,1566.21,--Three.
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1566.21,1568.691,"--our response to the petition for cert, page--"
1996.94-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1568.691,1570.782,Page... it begins at page 3--

1996.94-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1571.292,1572.284,--and then that's at page 12.
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1572.284,1588.626,"Asking that the water right of 67... 4304 be declared invalid, and the rest of them, Your Honor, are really in more of a general way."
1996.94-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1588.626,1590.505,Which brings us--
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1608.328,1615.06,"It should be... it needs to be amended, Your Honor, for... obviously for that reason."
1996.94-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.737,1640.97,"Not include what, quiet title actions?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1640.97,1641.671,Yes.
1996.94-1474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1668.335,1677.051,"Can you just tell us briefly what the reasoning of that is, that quiet title actions don't impact the sovereignty of the State?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1677.051,1693.033,"The cases are Roddy and the Lyons cases, and the... the thinking of the Idaho court was simply that quiet title actions were actions against the land, not against the sovereignty of the State."
1996.94-1474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1693.033,1695.844,Was it the in rem personification notion?
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1695.844,1699.977,"They didn't use those exact words, but that basic concept, yes, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.977,1703.63,"Well, that's a pretty strange doctrine, isn't it?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1716.418,1721.42,"Maybe I didn't understand the question, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1721.42,1741.735,"Well, I don't see how the State could take the position that a quiet title action asserting that the State lacks title to lands that the State claims in its sovereign capacity, how can it be said that doesn't affect the State sovereign interests?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1741.735,1761.648,"The Idaho court was... in the Roddy and Lyons cases were presented with a... claims against the State to quiet title, and they chose not to waive sovereign immunity judicially, which is what most States have done."
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1761.648,1768.173,"Yes, but you do agree in any event that a quiet title action could be brought by the Tribe in State court?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1768.173,1770.154,"No, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.012,1801.272,Even when the Indian tribe is the plaintiff?
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1801.743,1810.439,"--Well... I'm not talking about personal jurisdiction, the subject matter jurisdiction of the court."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.439,1817.054,"But the subject matter jurisdiction, aren't the court... what is it, the circuit court, the superior court, the district court--"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1817.054,1817.344,District--
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.344,1821.377,"--The district court is a court of general subject matter jurisdiction, isn't it?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1821.377,1821.965,--Yes.
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.965,1824.819,"I mean, it's not confined to certain types of cases."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1830.561,1873.591,"Well, I guess the problem, Your Honor, is that litigants cannot create subject matter jurisdiction upon a court that it doesn't otherwise have, and the only congressional act that... or the primary congressional act that conveyed subject matter jurisdiction on State courts to adjudicate Indian interests was Public Law 280, of course, and in that... in Public Law 280, as is discussed in Bryan/Itasca County, it's very clear that the statute... Congress specifically said that State courts do not have jurisdiction to adjudicate property determinations in Indian country against tribes."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.591,1882.657,"So an Indian tribe couldn't go into the district court of Ada County or something like that and sue someone who is trespassing on tribal property, in your view."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1882.657,1892.034,"I guess it would be... the short answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, is there is a serious question of subject matter jurisdiction."
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.989,1938.163,"In fact, there is another suit pending right now that would determine the issue of title?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1938.163,1940.584,"For... yes, Your Honor, for a portion of the lake."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2091.723,2099.159,Tindal tends to negate your statement that you distinguish sharply between State officer suits and Federal officer suits.
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2110.675,2121.282,"The Federal... violation of Federal law, the supremacy interest that was being protected in Tindal in that case was a taking interest."
1996.94-1474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2177.54,2183.613,"But in this case that's odd, because we're only talking about Federal law on both sides."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2198.262,2229.864,"Your Honor, there's no question but what the State officers thrust that forward as their argument, but I think the more appropriate way to analyze the issue here is that the Tribe claims ownership based on Federal law, and as a result of that claimed ownership, is asking the Federal court to enjoin State officers from their regulation of the Tribe's lake under State law."
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2267.268,2282.439,"Mr. Givens, could you... could the Tribes sue in Federal court just to determine title to this property, or do you concede that that is not... that the Eleventh Amendment would bar that?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2282.439,2295.806,"Well, Your Honor, that's what we did, and the... that's what the Ninth Circuit said it could not do, because that would be an adjudication against the State."
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2295.806,2296.277,Do you accept that?
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2296.277,2297.989,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2302.061,2310.415,"All right, and you are not here arguing that the Tribe could bring a direct suit in Federal court to determine title."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2310.415,2312.288,That is correct.
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2313.287,2317.982,"Well, what are the attributes of title ownership?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2323.165,2327.509,"--Well, it's... I guess it's like--"
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2327.509,2332.882,And won't that have to be determined basically by deciding who has the title?
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2346.44,2351.394,"--The issue of title will be an issue, just as--"
1996.94-1474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2351.394,2364.883,"Well, that being the case, I don't see why the Eleventh Amendment shouldn't be a bar here, because you are in essence asking the Court to do what you've conceded the Court can't do."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2368.646,2388.027,"--That is exactly the question that this Court addressed in Lee, it is exactly the question this Court addressed in Tindal, and in both instances they said no, we can separate the determination of title from the, in those cases trespass, in this case regulation by the State officers."
1996.94-1474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.572,2416.628,"Mr. Givens, Larson is more recent than those, and I thought it was made pretty clear in Larson, which was against the Federal Government, of course, that you can't proceed unless either the officers are acting beyond their authority ultra vires, or their action is unconstitutional."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2433.027,2463.588,"--The officers... it is never within the officer's ability as a State officer to violate the Federal Constitution, and these... part of which is the Supremacy Clause, and that is where the State officer and Federal officer cases depart, Your Honor, and I think it is why it is so important to keep clearly in mind which interest is really being protected."
1996.94-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2532.281,2534.923,"Mr. Givens... oh, I'm sorry."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2596.613,2599.497,"I think that would be correct, yes, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.155,2603.547,"Don't say it's correct if you don't really agree with it, because you're the expert in this area."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2603.547,2604.879,"--Oh, maybe I misunderstood exactly what you said, then."
1996.94-1474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.879,2606.18,"Yes... I mean, no, no, if you do agree, fine."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2625.794,2626.703,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.703,2640.092,"And you think that you can't distinguish real property cases where the Federal law gives the property to Jones, or Smith, or the Indian tribe from cases involving mental hospitals, schools, churches, whatever."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2642.043,2644.254,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2646.277,2651.8,"All right, but then we run into this doctrine, and you think Tindal is strongly in support of you."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2651.8,2671.102,"It is to the extent, Your Honor that Tindal said clearly that you... the Federal court can enjoin a State officer who is holding property unconstitutionally without adjudicating the title to that property."
1996.94-1474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2671.102,2674.804,"So what we have, is it fair to characterize... we have a fiction on a fiction."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2701.562,2702.634,That's right.
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.634,2703.292,All right.
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2707.386,2714.852,The State officers can no longer regulate the Tribe's lake.
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.972,2725.007,"So you really... you... the benefit you get is, you get the same result as if you acquire the title."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2725.007,2732.143,"--There are very... there are similarities, Your Honor, there is no question about that, and the--"
1996.94-1474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2732.143,2733.772,"Mr. Givens, isn't it more than similar?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2745.901,2751.755,--The... after--
1996.94-1474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.755,2759.322,"Because you would have to establish your title, although one party, Idaho, wouldn't be bound by it."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2759.322,2768.357,"--The... in determining this suit, the Court would adjudicate the Tribe's ownership."
1996.94-1474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2771.847,2777.952,"Well, they both... I think we can agree that they both can't own the same land."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2789.058,2801.516,"That's right, and as with any... anyone who files any quiet title action, if you don't sue Jones and Jones has a claim to it, you may get your quiet... your title quieted to everybody except Jones."
1996.94-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2804.759,2809.541,"Mr. Givens, may I go back to your answer to an earlier question from Justice Ginsburg?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2861.427,2862.028,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2862.028,2883.449,"Are we in a position to assess that answer, because I thought the very answer that you gave to Justice Kennedy earlier was that there are no specific detailed claims against State officers at this point, that's just not the state of the pleadings, and you said, well, we ought to go back and amend."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2900.042,2907.067,"The... you may be correct, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.202,2980.284,"Yes, but they weren't talking about the equal footing doctrine then, were they?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2980.284,2980.645,They were not.
1996.94-1474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2984.848,2988.922,And it's different... creating a reservation is much different than conveying land.
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,2988.922,3012.157,"--The... well, the creation of the reservation can or cannot convey land, and there was little analysis in that case, there's no question about that, but it did cite to Midwest Oil, which was decided 80 years ago when this Court held that the congressional acquiescence could... or by congressional."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3017.921,3022.252,"Well, Midwest Oil was certainly distinguished in the steel seizure case, was it not?"
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,3022.252,3025.685,It... acquiescence is not a--
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.685,3029.078,A sure thing.
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,3029.078,3029.518,--favored doctrine.
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3089.476,3095.452,"Of course, you could have the reservation here by executive proclamation and simply not get the submerged land rights."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,3095.452,3107.688,"--That's entirely possible, Your Honor, and the difficulty with even arguing this issue at this point is, it is at such a preliminary stage, and those questions need to be... I mean, that's the heart of the case."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3110.941,3124.56,"Well, how further would you do... I mean, if, in fact, a presidential proclamation without the authority of Congress cannot cut off a State's rights under the equal footing doctrine, there's nothing that a trial is going to prove about that."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,3124.56,3125.93,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3134.495,3139.09,"Well, but at least that would decide this... if we were to hold that, that would decide this aspect of the case."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,3139.09,3146.794,"I've gotten lost in the words, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.794,3148.356,"Well, I... I won't detain you."
1996.94-1474,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,3149.145,3150.006,"I'd love it, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3150.827,3152.477,"Mr. Strong, you have 4 minutes remaining."
1996.94-1474,2,19995,clive_j_strong,,3152.477,3158.202,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.94-1474,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3225.026,3230.079,"And what's the answer on that point, on that very point in Tindal?"
1996.94-1474,2,19995,clive_j_strong,,3234.22,3235.382,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I--"
1996.94-1474,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3235.382,3243.236,"Where the Court... this Court seemed to divide all the aspects of title... I mean, with the fiction of the title itself, and says the State gets another chance to litigate it."
1996.94-1474,2,19995,clive_j_strong,,3243.236,3251.253,"--Tindal is a much different case than the case we have before us, because in Tindal it was an issue where the officers through their actions came into possession of the property."
1996.94-1474,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3274.788,3292.029,"Idaho could have no complaint, could they, except for a defense on the merits, if the United States in its suit had chosen to litigate on behalf of the Tribe for this entire... for all the land that the Tribe is now claiming, rather than just a part of it?"
1996.94-1474,2,19995,clive_j_strong,,3292.029,3293.699,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
