1988.87-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.737,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1848, the City of Dallas v. Charles M. Stanglin."
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,10.872,13.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,56.667,65.423,"Well, now, do you say that the First Amendment doesn't protect any right of social association?"
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,65.423,67.891,Yes.
1988.87-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.891,68.275,Okay.
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,68.275,79.149,"We place reliance on the Roberts precedent not only because it is the most recent analysis of associational freedoms, but also because it is reasonable."
1988.87-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,111.404,123.045,"Well, do you think the City could adopt an ordinance telling all 14-year olds that they may not under any circumstances in their lives have any association with people over 18?"
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,123.045,124.995,"No, I think that would be going much too far."
1988.87-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.995,127.514,Then there is a right of social association.
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,127.514,131.481,"No, there's not a constitutionally protected right of association."
1988.87-1848,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.275,172.392,You don't think equal protection is a constitutional principle?
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,172.392,174.644,--It is a constitutional principle.
1988.87-1848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,313.735,320.239,"I take it some part of your argument, Mr. Hopkins, depends on the fact that the plaintiffs are minors."
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,327.478,329.161,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,347.808,348.891,"But, Mr. Hopkins, I'm a little--"
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,348.891,349.774,I think it's--
1988.87-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,349.774,350.058,--May I interrupt?
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,355.562,356.164,--Correct.
1988.87-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,356.164,361.216,"Well, why would... what would the constitutional right be at stake if it was a 30 to 35-year ordinance instead of a 14 to 18?"
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,361.216,364.168,My position is there is no right for them either.
1988.87-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,364.168,365.603,"So, that would be the same case then."
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,365.603,366.12,Correct.
1988.87-1848,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.12,368.055,"So, then why are you arguing about young people?"
1988.87-1848,0,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,368.055,372.673,"Well, assuming that you might find some associational right--"
1988.87-1848,1,21496,daniel_j_sheehan_jr,,1205.847,1210.982,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1988.87-1848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.732,1270.187,"Well, there's a constitutional right to walk down the street too, but that doesn't mean that every... every state statute that interferes with my walking down the street is subject to strict scrutiny."
1988.87-1848,1,21496,daniel_j_sheehan_jr,,1296.671,1305.527,"With due respect, Justice Scalia, I believe they are arguing that there is no constitutional protection and they're not restrained even by a rational basis test."
1988.87-1848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.527,1317.751,"I thought... I thought they agreed that they were subject at least to equal protection scrutiny, that you couldn't single out one class of people arbitrarily and say you can't go to the dance hall, but everybody else can."
1988.87-1848,1,21496,daniel_j_sheehan_jr,,1321.238,1329.476,"Mr. Chief Justice, I heard that statement made this afternoon and the concession that they would be restrained by equal protection considerations."
1988.87-1848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.144,1332.228,That's not really a concession.
1988.87-1848,1,21496,daniel_j_sheehan_jr,,1337.082,1343.469,"--I agree, and I also agree that every governmental action is restrained by the need to have some rational basis."
1988.87-1848,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.513,1374.107,"Well, we'd also like to hear your... you know, I think the... probably the Petitioners' position is... we can assume is fairly clear... have from the Petitioner, so to speak."
1988.87-1848,1,21496,daniel_j_sheehan_jr,,1382.963,1386.831,"I think that the... yes, I do."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,2948.288,2951.024,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.636,3077.623,"Yes, but Mr. Hopkins, does that testimony show that these drugs and alcohol and sexual overtures were all by people over 18?"
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3077.623,3081.159,--The record is... admittedly the record is silent as to ages.
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.159,3085.396,"And I assume they wouldn't have let them in in the first place, so they must presumably have been by people under that age."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3086.379,3088.015,"Well, the problem in this--"
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.015,3089.315,--that tends to undercut your position.
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3089.315,3100.906,"--Well, no, because the problem in this case is that his client had both a Class B and a Class E license, and apparently was in the practice of letting in people of all ages."
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3104.708,3110.028,"But the record does not show, does it, that this... these... these practices were by older people."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3110.028,3110.528,That's correct.
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.704,3127.823,They recognized the fact or they made the assumption?
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3127.823,3128.273,xxx.
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.273,3134.06,"See, in a lot of schools, as I understand it, people who are 16 or 17 have access to the same sort of undesirable materials."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3134.06,3146.702,"I would admit that... that people of tender years do have access, I think it's reasonable to make the statement that older people have greater access, however."
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.557,3159.111,"Yes, but now you're going back to assumptions where you are just going to start out and explain that the record answered these questions."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3161.979,3162.479,Well--
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3162.479,3165.681,"If you go back to what we all know, well, then you don't need to refer us to the record."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3165.681,3166.148,--Correct.
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.512,3220.166,Does the record tell us how many of these... what are they... Class E dance halls are licensed in Dallas?
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3220.166,3222.268,"No, the record does not tell us."
1988.87-1848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.717,3248.502,"Well, then the combination dance hall and skating rink is characteristic of these establishments."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3248.502,3251.704,"On sheer numbers, yes."
1988.87-1848,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3254.406,3257.608,Did you say there were 500 dance halls in Dallas?
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3257.608,3270.599,"--On a recent inquiry to the police department in charge of the licensing, he said that of all the categories, there were approximately 500 now in... licenses in effect."
1988.87-1848,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3270.599,3271.617,My.
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3284.108,3286.044,We allow dancing.
1988.87-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.65,3298.018,"--Anyway, you... you may be moving in on... on roller skating rinks next."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3299.718,3300.402,"Well, we're certainly--"
1988.87-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.402,3300.804,One step at a time.
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3303.104,3304.089,--We're certainly not--
1988.87-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.089,3305.306,--eliminate all the evils at once.
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3306.458,3310.76,--We're certainly not conceding that we have no right to move in on the skating rinks.
1988.87-1848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.76,3312.527,You haven't conceded much today.
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3314.161,3320.515,The... the Respondent also makes the statement that we might be infringing on a parental function.
1988.87-1848,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3372.35,3378.137,xxx the Equal Protection Clause would have some play in this case.
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3378.137,3385.058,"--We agree that there are, you know, probably several constitutional provisions that are applicable to government actions."
1988.87-1848,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.058,3385.791,"Well, suppose equal protection."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3397.715,3400.4,Assuming that that's an appropriate analysis.
1988.87-1848,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.221,3409.406,But you would have to have... you would have to have a rational basis at least.
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3409.406,3412.375,--On an equal protection challenge.
1988.87-1848,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3434.306,3444.762,"I thought they were... I thought they were also relying on the other branch of Roberts, the social intimate relationship."
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3444.762,3446.198,--In their brief they argue--
1988.87-1848,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.198,3446.898,Which is--
1988.87-1848,2,19071,craig_lee_hopkins,,3446.898,3447.414,--that it was intimate.
1988.87-1848,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.752,3482.935,"Thank you, Mr. Hopkins."
