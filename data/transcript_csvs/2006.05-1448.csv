2006.05-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We'll hear argument next in Case 05-1448, Beck versus PACE International Union."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,9.106,11.156,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,97.045,111.304,I could understand that if the plan is being set up or if there's going to be a change to the multiemployer plan while the business is ongoing.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,168.51,172.128,"Justice... Justice Ginsburg, that's not correct."
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,219.276,241.372,"Well if you're correct and this was a sponsor decision, not a fiduciary decision, let me ask you when you're wearing, when the company is wearing its sponsor hat and says we're going to terminate this plan, does it have a duty to consider the best interests and the security of the employees, number one, when it picks an insurance company?"
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,247.009,249.795,"Justice Kennedy, it depends upon the function at issue."
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.784,275.363,"But if have this duty to consider the interest of the employees in selecting the, the insurance company, in selecting the amount of the annuity, etcetera, if you have that duty it seems to me that that's a fiduciary duty."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,275.363,277.729,"--It absolutely is, Justice Kennedy, Kennedy."
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,294.657,297.459,"No, but that's I think our sticking point."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,355.315,361.385,"--There are two decisions in a merger case and the threshold question, Justice Souter, is whether to merge."
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.469,365.086,Why do you say that's the threshold question?
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,369.824,371.024,"--That's a different question, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,378.561,382.565,"If they say, look, we're not ending our plan."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,427.077,429.779,"--Justice Souter, there are two different questions."
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,444.205,446.105,The form of the plan is going to be zero.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,462.417,464.619,"It's not a disposition of assets, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.619,475.308,"Are you saying you can't have a merger of a plan that has already been terminated, so that the merger decision is necessarily a decision that has to be made before the termination... before a termination decision."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,475.308,484.949,"It is... once a plan decision, once a termination decision has been made, and once that decision has been executed, it's impossible to merge the plan."
2006.05-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.949,497.257,"Mr. Baker, I thought your position in your briefs, and I don't know why you do not make this reply to this exchange, is that the merger with another plan is not a termination, isn't that your basic position?"
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.257,498.257,That's what I keep suggesting.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,498.257,499.709,"Absolutely, it's not a termination."
2006.05-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.709,506.796,"Because if it were a termination, in a termination, you must distribute the assets to the participants."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,514.183,515.885,"That's absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.885,519.77,"I agree with Justice Scalia, that that's one answer."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,527.609,528.226,That's correct.
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.226,535.132,"So we will have to assume for that... if you can't do it by merger, then the whole case goes away anyway."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,540.417,541.286,That's correct.
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,541.286,546.154,So what we're asking in the first part of this argument is whether or not it's a fiduciary response.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,574.757,581.761,"The answer, Justice Kennedy, is that it is a business decision to decide in what form the benefits are going to be provided."
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,589.683,595.087,Why can't you say it's a business decision as to which insurance company you're going to select.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,596.387,600.075,"--Because at that point, it's a mere execution of the prior policy decision."
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.075,601.708,"Well, but that's the way you characterize it."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,610.18,618.619,"Because the merger decision... you have to ask those threshold questions, Justice Kennedy, what are the level of benefits that are going to be provided in the acquiring plan."
2006.05-1448,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,626.356,628.391,I'm just listening to this.
2006.05-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.116,676.651,He doesn't like to hear that he is wrong.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,676.651,681.936,"None of us do, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1448,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,694.244,698.862,"Why did you answer yes to his question, Justice Kennedy's, about the insurance company?"
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,698.862,700.814,--Perhaps I was imprecise.
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,730.0,734.619,Why isn't exactly the same point true with respect to purchasing annuities?
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,734.619,740.975,"Because the decision has already been made, usually it's in the plan document, to provide for annuities."
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,746.609,751.163,What if the plan document doesn't say anything about what will follow termination.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,760.969,763.488,You mean the decision to offer annuities?
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.91,784.302,"The decision to... to take the option of purchasing annuities or offering annuities to the beneficiaries, that is a fiduciary decision."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,784.302,788.888,"--No, Justice... the... if the plan is silent--"
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,788.888,789.555,If the plan is silent.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,789.555,796.525,"--If the plan is silent, and the plan sponsor... and the question is, how do we distribute, the mechanism of distribution."
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,799.061,805.565,"What if they say, we will distribute by going to the top of the building and throwing the money out on the street."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,807.317,811.619,"--Well, that would not be permitted by the, by the--"
2006.05-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,811.619,811.821,Right--
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,811.821,814.587,"--By operation of law, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.587,822.427,"--I thought your argument was, once you make a decision to terminate, there are various rules that are triggered, you just can't take the money and run with it."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,830.283,836.202,"Well, that is a second argument, an alternative argument, Chief Justice Roberts, that merger is not a means of termination."
2006.05-1448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.502,840.488,Maybe it's a simpler argument than this first one we've been wrestling with.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,840.488,847.41,"--Justice Scalia, they may have different issues associated with them."
2006.05-1448,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,858.599,865.705,"Is what's really involved in this, who is going to get the $5 million reversion that you would get if you purchased an annuity?"
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,868.407,871.959,"That's what's really in dispute, Justice Alito."
2006.05-1448,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,871.959,874.227,"I mean, PACE would like it, you would like it."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,882.131,885.099,"Well, it's not a fiduciary duty."
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,901.628,904.08,"But Justice Alito's question, and I have the same question."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,929.378,934.099,"If we lose on both the issues that we have argued, Justice--"
2006.05-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,934.099,945.324,"But the point is the $5 million is not going to these employees, it's being thrown into this vast sea of all these other employees, whose employers have not done as good a job of funding their plans."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,958.231,959.247,"--Well, that's absolutely correct."
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,962.785,975.926,"But then you say that if it's a fiduciary obligation, and the merger is a permitted option, that the administrator, A, can, or B, must still give the money back to you."
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,975.926,979.228,"If it's a fiduciary obligation, no."
2006.05-1448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,992.805,1000.474,"The administrator, as a fiduciary, can consider the interest of the employer as well as the employees?"
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1000.474,1003.493,--No.
2006.05-1448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1008.814,1011.247,No.
2006.05-1448,0,35553,m_miller_baker,,1012.016,1013.266,I'd like to reserve my time.
2006.05-1448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1013.266,1014.366,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1023.99,1026.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1057.311,1083.045,"Suppose the argument is made very forcefully that the insurance companies with these annuities haven't been doing so well, but there is this multi-employer plan that has been just performing so well, and so the... an appeal is made to the company, you're going out of business, you're not going to be running a plan anymore."
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1090.032,1102.99,"Well, that would be not be a distribution of the assets as a means of terminating the plan, but the employer as a sponsor could, of course, decide to merge the plan instead of to terminate the plan, if the employer made that choice."
2006.05-1448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.99,1120.451,"You're making the same rigid argument that Mr. Baker made, that whatever the termination, even though the company is going out of business, it's bankrupt, it's always... a merger is always characterized as a sponsor business, not fiduciary."
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1120.451,1120.987,Yes.
2006.05-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1204.907,1208.843,Could an administrator make that decision in its fiduciary capacity?
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1208.843,1231.375,"No, Your Honor, and that goes back to a confusion that I think was... was present before, that the decision about the distribution options at termination is a sponsor decision that the employer makes in the plan documents, because those distribution options are benefits under the plan."
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1277.689,1279.472,Then why are we having this argument?
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1286.109,1295.984,"Well, we think that one requirement is that it's consistent with the plan, and the plan didn't provide that here."
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1295.984,1297.101,Then why isn't--
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1297.101,1298.936,Held it was waived.
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1298.936,1304.09,"--Then why isn't the simple argument, you can't merge because the plan didn't provide that as an option."
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1304.09,1310.661,"That would certainly be a basis on which the Court of Appeals could have correctly decided this case, other than the way it did."
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1310.661,1313.528,"Was that position presented, I should have asked you--"
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1313.528,1315.195,It was presented.
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1336.376,1345.584,"--So we've got to assume that the plan is silent in the sense that, insofar as the plan documents are concerned, merger is at least a possibility."
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1345.584,1347.75,"I don't think that you have to assume that, Your Honor."
2006.05-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.752,1414.858,Could a plan document provide that upon termination the employer is entitled to a refund of any excess funding?
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1419.077,1426.082,The plan document could provide for a reversion for the employer and in fact this... it does.
2006.05-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.749,1431.403,And I take it the administrator would then have the duty to obey that?
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1431.403,1433.086,--That.
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.592,1447.413,Then why doesn't the administrator here take the position that it's going to reserve the five million for itself and merge what's left?
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1451.881,1467.409,"Well, an employer, not an administrator could, could as a sponsor of the plan decide to do a transfer of assets and liabilities of some portion of the, of the plan assets and retain some assets in the plan."
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1467.409,1474.23,"My question is why... why isn't it an option here to say all right, number one, we got a $5 million surplus."
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1485.954,1494.644,What the employer would have to do would be make a sponsor decision to make a transfer of assets and liabilities to the PACE plan before terminating the plan.
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1507.051,1511.355,By doing it in that sequence could it reserve the five million for itself?
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1511.355,1562.538,"It... it could conceivably do that, Your Honor, subject to the fact that there are guidelines that the agencies have put out, the 1984 joint guidelines that require in some cases, in order to prevent circumvention of the termination requirements, that require the purchase of annuities or the other distribution of the assets, that those guidelines require that if there is a spinoff or a transfer of assets that's followed by the, by the termination of the remains of the transferee plan, that in some circumstances annuities have to be purchased for the accrued benefits of the participants that are transferred into the other ongoing plan and that are going to be participants of that plan."
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1562.538,1565.656,"If we assume that, can they keep the five million?"
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1565.656,1570.81,"Yes, Your Honor but that would be a decision that they make as sponsor of the plan."
2006.05-1448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1570.81,1583.201,"I don't care how they make it; I just want to know under the terms of the plan and consistently with ERISA, could they keep the five million and in some sequence provide for a merger with PACE?"
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1585.403,1599.913,"Yes, Your Honor, subject to the fact that here it's quite possible that the PBGC would consider a transfer of assets and liabilities just to leave assets in a plan as a reversion, that they would be subject to that requirement."
2006.05-1448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1620.124,1623.66,"Then why couldn't the PBGC say, you know, we are not quite sure how these insurance companies work."
2006.05-1448,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1632.265,1633.265,If I could answer the--
2006.05-1448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1665.32,1667.521,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,1673.925,1676.794,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.717,1803.823,"Of course this argument would not have any force whatever if indeed, transferring the assets to another plan does not constitute a termination of the plan."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,1803.823,1832.175,"Justice Scalia, that of course is the second major issue in the case, and the Government's attorney admitted that in a two-stage transaction, the assets and liabilities of a plan can be transferred to another plan, and the plan can be terminated and assuming the plan provisions are correctly in place the employer can take the reversion of any excess assets."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.592,1835.627,But the first step would be the transfer.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,1845.352,1867.698,"--Justice Scalia, the implementation guidelines which the Government attorney also referred to have as their entire focus to make certain that two-part transactions of just the sort that you have referred to are treated as a single whole in determining whether a plan has been legitimately terminated or not."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.345,1899.153,"That's fine, but that still does not convert the termination decision into, into a, an administrator's decision, rather than a sponsor's decision."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,1899.153,1900.203,I agree completely--
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1900.203,1909.509,"Sure, you can oversee it and make sure that there is no hanky-panky going on in the two-step process but the... but the determination whether to terminate or not is a sponsor's determination."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,1909.509,1911.211,"--I agree completely, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.269,1960.644,"But they, but they don't say that in, in looking at the two of them, you suddenly transform the decision whether to, to transfer as... as a termination."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,1965.846,1967.398,"No, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1448,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.826,2011.709,I'm puzzled.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2025.502,2027.386,"--That is correct, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1448,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.386,2028.469,"Your, your adversary--"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2028.469,2029.236,--that the termination decision has been made.
2006.05-1448,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.236,2032.671,--I disagree with you on that.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2032.671,2033.623,I'm sorry; I didn't--
2006.05-1448,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.623,2038.508,Your adversary takes a position that the merger would be not a termination.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2038.508,2040.61,--That is what my adversary says.
2006.05-1448,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.737,2061.79,It would seem to me that a merger is a continuation rather than a termination.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2065.242,2102.267,"The Government's regulations on single employer plan mergers take the very clear position, and we cited them in our brief, it's the regulations under Section 414(1), the clear position that any time there is a transfer of assets and liabilities from one plan to another, whether a complete transfer or not, that is treated as a spinoff of a plan from the original plan and a merger of the spun off assets and liabilities into the other plan."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.55,2153.017,Right.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2163.925,2165.141,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.925,2178.267,"And that in the case of a merger the assets are not distributed to the beneficiaries, they are distributed to this new plan, which benefits not only the beneficiaries of this plan but the beneficiaries of other plans."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2178.267,2181.552,"Justice Scalia, we disagree for the following reason."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2270.943,2271.377,Right.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2315.472,2323.126,"Well, Justice Scalia, it does it in exactly the same way the purchase of an insurance policy to provide annuities from an insurer does."
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.149,2348.36,"But I thought we just heard that the PBGC might look at it a little differently, that they are more comfortable with the annuity insuring that these beneficiaries get their benefits as opposed to just throwing the beneficiaries into a pool with your other union members."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2348.36,2381.915,"Mr. Chief Justice, it's very clear that if as we are correct... I mean, as we argue here, if we're correct that it is a fiduciary responsibility for the plan administrator to select the option on the table that is most secure for providing the benefits in the future to the participants, that if the multiemployer plan in question were poorly funded or shaky for any other reason and there is a solid insurance company offering an annuity, that the plan administrator would--"
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2381.915,2384.117,Doesn't this put you in an awfully difficult position?
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2410.284,2415.505,--The plan administrator is the one that ultimately makes the determination.
2006.05-1448,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2427.729,2431.597,"Well, why would the beneficiaries be better off if there were a merger?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2435.216,2468.306,"--Probably the single advantage to participants in a multiemployer plan is portability, which is to say some of these participants were working for employers that purchased facilities from Crown and if their employer participated in the multiemployer plan in the future they would be able to add to the benefits that they had accrued and perhaps to reach something like an enhanced benefit at 25 years of service or the like."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.934,2495.124,"Does it make a commitment, a commitment to fully provide all benefit liabilities under the now deceased plan?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2495.124,2496.557,"Yes, it does, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2514.168,2515.668,What's the... I'm trying to work this out now.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2535.664,2536.147,PBGC.
2006.05-1448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.147,2536.497,--Yes.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2538.283,2539.099,They do not.
2006.05-1448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2539.099,2540.033,"They do not, okay."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2629.376,2629.926,No.
2006.05-1448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2629.926,2632.126,"Well then, if not that why this?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2632.126,2632.328,No.
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2655.259,2656.86,And beyond as well?
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2668.834,2671.72,"That would depend on the plan, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2672.486,2677.274,"Well, the terms, the plans terms here, did not provide for merger in the event of termination, right?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2677.274,2678.774,"--No, we disagree."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.761,2690.498,"The other side said that the district court found that the argument was waived, or the court of appeals did."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2690.498,2694.486,"Justice Scalia, it was the court of appeals that held that the argument was waived."
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2709.328,2711.495,Even though the district court decided it?
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2716.399,2727.123,"In this case, I could see a reason why that would make sense, because in the bankruptcy proceeding both parties presented evidence, and the interpretation of a plan document is like interpreting any other contract."
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2731.075,2740.764,"If you're... if you prevail here... I mean, the reason we have a case is because the employer overfunded the plan to the tune of $5 million."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2754.19,2764.63,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that that's the case, because the funding rules of ERISA do encourage employers to fund well at times when times are good."
2006.05-1448,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2765.532,2774.021,"Well, if you prevail won't plan documents or shouldn't plan documents be amended to say that merger is not an option and any reversion goes to the employer?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2774.021,2776.054,"--That may well be the case, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2786.328,2793.665,What possible equitable basis does the union have to claim this extra $5 million?
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2793.665,2794.767,The actual--
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2794.767,2796.167,It's not for these beneficiaries.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2810.194,2813.896,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I could answer that on two levels."
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2830.524,2837.011,"Are there a lot of plans that look like that, that if there's extra money, we've overfunded that it goes back to the union, not back to the company?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2837.011,2838.694,It never goes to the union.
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2841.13,2841.646,The union plan.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2841.646,2842.782,But to a plan.
2006.05-1448,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2850.402,2859.175,"Well, how could the administrator, how could the administrator negotiate with the employer to give the $5 million back if it's with a fiduciary?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2859.175,2873.684,"--If the employer had said, had amended the plan to say, whatever you do by way of terminating this plan, you must protect our right to the reversion, then the plan administrator would have been--"
2006.05-1448,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2873.684,2875.886,"Well, I suppose if it would have been amended."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2894.098,2905.005,"--No, Justice Kennedy, it is not, because there there really is an impact on the form and the amount of benefits that will be accrued in the future under an ongoing plan, as well as--"
2006.05-1448,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2905.005,2913.094,So then it's the ongoing significance of the decision to the employer that determines whether there's a fiduciary obligation?
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2913.094,2914.161,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1448,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2934.958,2942.863,I can't see why it's a fiduciary obligation in case A... a sponsor obligation in case A and a fiduciary obligation in case B.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,2947.749,2950.051,"Again, it's not, it's not the timing."
2006.05-1448,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2978.371,2978.871,Okay.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3020.364,3029.653,"That would be a plan sponsor decision, but the plan sponsor would be subjecting itself to obligations for future enhanced funding of the plan that it joins."
2006.05-1448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3029.653,3044.396,"Could you go back for just one second to Justice Alito's question, because that's what I'm having trouble with, because I think the question is what, assuming you're right on all the other points for argument's sake, but what is the advantage to the worker here?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3069.796,3077.134,"Justice Breyer, I believe I was cut off and didn't finish my answer to your question when you asked it before."
2006.05-1448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3126.717,3139.977,"So then you're saying that the answer... we have annuity company A and B, they're identical, the worker has a pension that promises them $1,000 a month, not a penny more, and company A says, we'll give you $500 extra."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3148.063,3152.265,Only if the two companies are equivalent in terms of their security.
2006.05-1448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3152.265,3161.704,"I said they are equivalent in terms of... of the security and so forth; they are each good companies and one will write out a check for $500, which is what I thought my example was."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3168.809,3176.296,"I'm trying to make sure that I understand your question fully, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-1448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.14,3222.194,"Well, I don't think, I just don't read 1341 the way you do."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3279.948,3286.97,"Well, Justice Scalia, a safe harbor doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't appropriate for the fiduciary to consider other alternatives."
2006.05-1448,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3300.627,3301.094,Well... excuse me.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3320.525,3329.881,"If... if options have been proposed and they are of equal or better security for the participants, yes, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1448,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3329.881,3334.534,"And you're saying in this case, this is sort of the square one question that I want to be clear on."
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3351.51,3352.079,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1448,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3352.079,3352.479,Okay.
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.479,3353.462,"Counsel, your little--"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3368.839,3375.777,"That was what the district court found, that the provisions of the plan authorized the merger, as an option."
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3375.777,3378.479,"Do you know, is there a particular provision in the plan that says that?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3378.963,3382.598,The district court cited what it was relying on; I don't have those at my fingertips.
2006.05-1448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3382.598,3390.871,"Was it specific in the plan or it just didn't exclude, the plan didn't exclude the possibility of merger?"
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3390.871,3397.625,Well... the usual reading of a term in accordance with means that it must not violate.
2006.05-1448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3400.393,3404.529,So that could be if they just didn't say anything so it would be a choice.
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.401,3413.368,--I don't read in accordance with the way you do.
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3416.854,3423.842,Certainly if the plan has a provision then it must be followed.
2006.05-1448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3447.741,3451.66,--Do I understand that your position is twofold?
2006.05-1448,2,29637,julia_p_clark,,3470.406,3472.775,"Precisely, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3476.21,3477.427,Thank you Ms. Clark.
2006.05-1448,3,35553,m_miller_baker,,3480.679,3483.547,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1448,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3640.515,3645.067,I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a reversion to the employees who have made contributions.
2006.05-1448,3,35553,m_miller_baker,,3646.336,3646.686,Yes.
2006.05-1448,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3655.359,3656.325,Right.
2006.05-1448,3,35553,m_miller_baker,,3656.325,3663.112,--the employee has a right to a pro rata percentage of the surplus plan assets in the event of termination.
2006.05-1448,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3667.599,3685.828,"What if the plan, the plan provides that in the event of a merger there will in fact be a reversion to the employees, if they've paid in too much or to, or to the sponsor if the sponsor has overfunded, and there will be no merger except on those terms?"
2006.05-1448,3,35553,m_miller_baker,,3687.663,3689.196,I'm not sure I... I understand your question.
2006.05-1448,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3689.196,3698.887,"If the plan document says look, if we decide to merge, anybody who has paid in more than he has to, employee or employer, gets the money back or there's no merger."
2006.05-1448,3,35553,m_miller_baker,,3704.541,3709.509,"A plan cannot provide for that because it would be contrary to ERISA, Justice Souter."
