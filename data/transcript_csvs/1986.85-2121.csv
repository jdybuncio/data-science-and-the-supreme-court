1986.85-2121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.517,"We will hear argument now in Number 85-2121, Arizona versus William Carl Mauro."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,12.228,15.261,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-2121,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,272.859,278.412,"Mr. Roberts, are you asking that we cut back on Rhode Island against Innis?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,278.412,279.393,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,283.756,286.938,You don't think this is just a fact bound application of Innis?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,286.938,295.474,"No, Your Honor, because whether or not it was interrogation is a question of law, and I am submitting that as a question of law the Arizona Supreme Court was wrong."
1986.85-2121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.951,360.635,"No charge had been filed yet, or what?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,360.635,374.216,"I think it would be critical, perhaps in a Sixth Amendment context, Your Honor, but respondent has conceded at page 9 of her answering brief and the Arizona Supreme Court's opinion makes it abundantly clear that they decided this on purely Fifth Amendment grounds."
1986.85-2121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,392.208,400.012,What if the right to counsel had been invoked?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,400.012,407.188,"Well, if the right to counsel had been invoked, Your Honor, I would be taking precisely the same position because what was it police did?"
1986.85-2121,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,485.338,502.319,"Well, Mr. Roberts, do you think the result would be any different if the police had simply planted a tape recorder on the defendant's wife and let her speak to he defendant so that it wasn't obvious to the defendant?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,502.319,509.775,"If you mean, Justice O'Connor, simply planted it on her but all other circumstances remained the same?"
1986.85-2121,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,509.775,517.489,"No policeman present listening, but they hear through the tape recorder planted on her."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,519.291,524.884,"I don't believe it would, Your Honor, because still there is no official police conduct."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.344,573.766,"Mr. Roberts, can I just refresh my recollection."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,578.41,580.47,--He did invoke his right to counsel.
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.47,581.091,"I thought he did, yes."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,584.763,585.323,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.676,590.709,Did he ask for counsel as well as wanting to be silent?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,590.709,594.791,"That's correct, Your Honor, fifteen minutes before this, and police ceased questioning."
1986.85-2121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.717,615.844,I suppose it would have been different if the police had secured someone... had asked his brother to go talk to him and get out of him what he could?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,615.844,620.147,"I think, Your Honor, it would be a closer case because then you have the idea--"
1986.85-2121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.147,621.778,Of approaching him--
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,621.778,626.072,"--Yes, originating with the police, and they are trying to get the brother to do something for them."
1986.85-2121,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,790.669,793.661,"--Mr. Roberts, let me ask you something."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,799.956,804.788,"Oh, they initially and exclusively decided this case on the basis of the Fifth Amendment."
1986.85-2121,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,804.788,805.248,Say it again?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,805.248,810.161,They initially and exclusively decided this case on the basis of the Fifth Amendment and this Court's holding.
1986.85-2121,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,810.161,815.466,"Well, then isn't all the talk about the Sixth Amendment in Greenholtz just pure dicta?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,815.466,819.788,"In Greenfield, you mean, Your Honor?"
1986.85-2121,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,819.788,821.029,Doesn't that defeat you?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,821.029,830.666,"I think not, Your Honor, because they cited no Arizona cases and no Arizona rules of evidence and no Arizona law for not allowing this in as rebuttal."
1986.85-2121,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,842.592,858.974,"I can't get away from the fact that this is just a pure factual application of the Innis case, and all your talk about Greenfield and the Sixth Amendment is rather by the way."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,858.974,863.976,"Well, Your Honor, I agree with you that it should be decided and reversed on the basis that there was no interrogation."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.994,953.466,"I must confess, I am a little puzzled."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,955.957,962.011,"--The relevance of hearing his wife, Your Honor, was that defense counsel had attempted to portray his wife as responsible for the murder."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.132,964.963,I still don't understand.
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,964.963,965.955,"--Well, if when you read--"
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.955,971.027,This was offered in evidence to show that his wife was not responsible for the murder?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,971.027,971.538,"--No, no--"
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.538,974.631,To rebut the claim of insanity of the--
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,974.631,975.171,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.74,981.312,"--It's not her voice, it's what she said, you mean?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,982.604,988.408,"Well, the trial court held that both were important, Your Honor, because you can't, on a piece of paper you can't get intonations and pauses."
1986.85-2121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.88,1001.868,"For him the tape was important because the mere tone and everything was important, but for her it was what she said that was important to the jury, right, that it was clear she hadn't had anything to do with the murder?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1001.868,1005.489,"Oh, yes, I agree with that, and that was simply one reason the trial court gave, but you are correct, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.721,1027.704,What was the Arizona Supreme Court's response to this argument?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1031.568,1033.017,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.518,1051.32,"Generally, and in this particular case too."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1055.173,1059.394,"--I don't... well, perhaps we read the opinion differently at that point Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.267,1065.368,You can't quote it?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1065.368,1066.219,You can't quote it.
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.118,1081.159,And you couldn't have testified he was not moaning and groaning like an animal here?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1081.159,1084.612,"Certainly we could have done that, Your Honor, but it would not have been as effective."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.915,1126.07,"He was invoking his own Miranda rights when he said he wanted a lawyer before he testified, wasn't he?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1126.07,1128.734,"Fifteen minutes earlier, Your Honor, but no testimony about that."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.734,1132.905,"Well, to the extent he invoked Miranda rights, they were his own Miranda rights?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1132.905,1135.757,"That is correct, Your Honor, but not in the exchange with his wife."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.191,1142.975,"You mean, he didn't ask her for warnings before he spoke to her?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1143.794,1144.465,Okay.
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.489,1151.21,Right.
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1152.23,1153.041,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.193,1184.012,"--Well, the question, as I understand, is whether the previous invocation of Miranda rights, and asking for a lawyer, tainted this conversation because he wasn't given a lawyer, and the question is whether this was interrogation or not."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1185.131,1187.822,"Yes, Your Honor, but going back to the first point, and as I have argued it is not interrogation."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.822,1188.583,I understand your point.
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1197.019,1197.68,That's true.
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1198.871,1202.852,I don't understand the invoking Miranda rights in conversation with his wife.
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1203.783,1207.246,"--What I am saying is, he did not invoke his Miranda rights."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.319,1215.791,There are a lot of distinctions from Greenfield.
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1217.743,1238.276,"We have also cited to this Court the case of Nichols versus Wainwright, and there the Eleventh Circuit did not find it impermissible for the prosecutor to use as impeachment a statement that the defendant made one-half hour after his arrest."
1986.85-2121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.692,1418.974,Was it impeachment of what in both of those cases?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1421.407,1423.368,"--Yes, it was impeachment of the defendant who took the stand, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.368,1425.599,Showing that he was perjuring himself?
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1425.599,1426.24,That's correct.
1986.85-2121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.24,1428.651,"That isn't the case here, is it?"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1428.651,1434.645,"No, the one we had is, we were impeaching defense evidence that he was simply a babbling animal later in the day."
1986.85-2121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.645,1446.072,"That's a little different thing from saying, we're going to allow it to be used in order to protect the integrity of the trial system, if somebody tries to perjure himself at trial, we'll let it in."
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1466.465,1467.186,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.794,1520.851,"Is it not correct, though, that in this case the tape was... the Arizona Supreme Court said it would be all right to use the tape, to play it to the psychiatrist who could then testify by interpreting this, as to how rational--"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1520.851,1534.97,"--Yes, Your Honor, they could use that in their opinions, but the defense still has the benefit of showing the defendant as an unintelligible person making animal-like sounds, with the tape, a live tape they can play to the jury, and that's the impression the jury has the rest of the day."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.262,1540.364,"--They wouldn't treat it as countervailing evidence that a psychiatrist said,"
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1545.639,1546.949,"No, I am not saying that, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.211,1557.276,It certainly would show that he did not always talk in the way in which he was recorded on one particular point in time.
1986.85-2121,0,32579,jack_roberts,,1557.276,1557.926,"That is true, it would, Your Honor."
1986.85-2121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.677,1578.22,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1580.503,1593.062,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-2121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1669.411,1676.415,"Doesn't the Fifth Amendment mean something more than, the police know that incriminating statements might be made?"
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1680.739,1682.398,"--Yes, it does."
1986.85-2121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.368,1699.76,"Is that an active role, to allow a conversation to come in?"
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1714.72,1724.766,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree specifically with that because the police department controlled whether or not the conversation took place."
1986.85-2121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.866,1737.844,"They tried to talk her out of it, didn't they?"
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1737.844,1741.227,"One of them did, but the supervisor said no."
1986.85-2121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.227,1743.32,Is it necessary that more than one of them do it?
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1743.32,1744.089,Pardon?
1986.85-2121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.089,1747.081,"I mean, not only didn't they instigate it, but they tried to talk her out of it."
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1791.73,1792.291,"Yes, Justice."
1986.85-2121,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1792.291,1799.615,"Didn't the trial court find that the defendant did know, was told that the conversation would be taped?"
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1799.615,1802.369,The trial court did say that.
1986.85-2121,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1814.835,1819.219,There is a conflict between what the Arizona Supreme Court found and what the trial court found?
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1819.219,1820.959,"Yes, I believe so."
1986.85-2121,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1825.373,1829.704,"The tape recorder was in plain view, that's not debated, is it?"
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1829.704,1831.227,"No, that is not debated."
1986.85-2121,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1862.877,1871.423,"You would agree, I suppose, that the tape recorder would perhaps be more influential with the jury than the verbal testimony of a police officer?"
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1871.423,1872.003,I would agree with that.
1986.85-2121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.003,1879.398,"Mrs. Kelly, what is the point upon which you just said that the trial court, the Superior Court and the Supreme Court of Arizona disagreed?"
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1879.398,1894.617,"Well, I believe that the trial court found that Mr. Mauro knew that his wife was coming in and knew that the police officer was going to record the conversation."
1986.85-2121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1894.617,1904.585,"Whether he knew in advance... he surely knew when she in fact came in, when the police officer in fact came in and sat down, that that was the situation."
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1904.585,1910.088,"Yes, but I would submit that that is a highly coercive situation."
1986.85-2121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.294,1921.626,It's not enough that it be coercive as a matter of fact.
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1926.857,1931.322,"I would agree that it has to be coercive in that situation, yes."
1986.85-2121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.68,1971.487,"But you are suggesting that if the police know that some incriminating statement is likely, then it is interrogation on their part, but I think you are forgetting the necessity that the police have produced the coercion."
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,1971.487,1978.042,But I think the police did produce the coercion by allowing the two to get together.
1986.85-2121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2048.287,2052.31,Were these statements the result of questions?
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,2052.31,2055.673,No.
1986.85-2121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.586,2061.236,Does Miranda require questions?
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,2061.236,2066.231,"--No, I don't believe that Miranda requires questions in and of itself."
1986.85-2121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2087.863,2100.042,"You assert here, and I guess you have to assert, that the mere demonstration that you are rational constitutes an incriminating statement."
1986.85-2121,1,34020,kathleen_kelly_walsh,,2132.993,2151.986,"No, because I think as this Court has mentioned, there is contact between a defendant and police, jailers, at all times, that that could produce that kind of conversation."
