2004.03-892,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.811,"We'll hear argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue... Internal Revenue against Banks and the Commissioner against Banaitis."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,10.857,13.829,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,44.46,50.35,"Now, if... if this didn't involve the alternative minimum tax, would the amount be deductible?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,50.35,56.266,"Your Honor, but for the alternative minimum tax, there would be an... a miscellaneous itemized deduction--"
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,56.266,56.532,Right.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,56.532,58.124,--under section 212 of the code--
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.124,58.95,Right.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,58.95,65.926,--that would be subject to the limit of the 2 percent of adjusted gross income that applies to itemized deductions.
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,68.981,69.89,That's of annual income.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,72.862,74.265,--Of the adjusted gross income.
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.265,74.72,For the year.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,74.72,75.358,For the year.
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.084,84.257,"But, gee, in the case of a... of a major award, that 2 percent is very likely to be exceeded, isn't it?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,84.257,86.076,"It... it certainly may, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,86.076,92.885,So this is a problem that's going to exist even... even after the alternate minimum tax is abolished.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,94.099,102.067,"I'm not sure entirely what you're referring to as the problem, but it is the case that... that--"
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.067,104.296,"Well, you don't think... the Government doesn't think it's a problem."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,116.723,117.06,--That is correct.
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.472,146.649,Don't some States such as Oregon require a plaintiff to remit a portion of punitive damages recovered to the State so they don't even go to the taxpayer?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,148.795,151.767,"Your Honor, I would think the answer to that question is no."
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.711,159.28,"Well, what about attorney's fees in class actions?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,170.054,171.086,--Your Honor--
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.086,176.742,A plaintiff who's part of a class in a class action suit where attorney's fees are paid.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,176.742,185.387,"--Your Honor, we believe that the same principles would apply to class action lawsuits as to other lawsuits in terms of the taxation of litigation proceeds."
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.915,219.261,"Well, I... I thought we were... our attention was pointed to a number of instances where the Internal Revenue Service did not require the taxpayer to show all the attorney's fees as income in those class action situations."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,219.261,220.337,"Your Honor, that is correct."
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.337,221.246,Yes.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,221.246,221.452,I want to be clear.
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,240.156,242.302,Why... why isn't there as much control in each case?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,253.364,257.701,"--Again, the principles would apply and there may very well be class actions--"
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,257.701,259.187,"Yes, and I... I want to know why the result would be different."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,259.187,263.395,"--Again, I'm... I'm trying to be as specific as I can."
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,277.513,279.536,Why... why would... why would that analysis appear?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,286.595,289.113,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,290.311,292.828,"So we're in the... so we're in the situation we're in right now, aren't we?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,292.828,298.955,--We are in the situation in which there's a need to apply the general principles for defining gross income.
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.955,301.35,All right. But let me just... I'll just press the point one more time.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,309.236,313.323,"And... and what I'm trying to point out, Your Honor, is that there may very well be class actions where it's not different."
2004.03-892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,329.177,334.007,I thought the class action distinction that the commissioner had was between opt in and opt out.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,334.007,339.391,--That is certainly one of the factors that... that the commissioner has looked to in those class--
2004.03-892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,339.391,342.142,"So if you opt in, then you did exercise control."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,349.118,350.854,"--Again, those are all facts--"
2004.03-892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,350.854,351.597,That's the basic thing.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,373.888,375.003,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.526,396.755,"When you say the class member, do you... you mean the named representative."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,403.404,411.904,"--Well, presumably, Your Honor, that... only the portion of the attorney's fees that would be attributable to the... the named representative's recovery would be included in the named representative's gross income."
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.639,430.441,"--Well, then... then would it be... would the income then go to each class... would each class member have a share of the income?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,430.441,432.959,"--In a number of instances, yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.975,476.843,"Suppose... suppose the same amount were paid, as was paid here, to the attorney, but it was not by way of a contingent fee, that the... the client had committed to pay this dollar amount in a dollar amount."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,476.843,477.502,--As a flat fee?
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.502,478.412,As a flat fee.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,480.558,499.793,"Your Honor, I think in fact it is undisputed in... in the... in these cases that if the payment of attorney's fees had either been under an hourly rate arrangement or a flat fee arrangement, that the entire amount of the litigation proceeds would be included in the... in the respondent's gross income and nothing about the contingent fee arrangements here should... should alter that result."
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,500.742,504.54,"Well, let... let me ask you about Professor Davenport's theory."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,521.174,523.736,"--Your Honor, I'm trying to recall that amicus brief."
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,530.918,531.29,Yes.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,531.29,533.769,--in exchange for services and you provide property?
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.769,534.173,Yes.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,534.173,548.474,"We think that the better way to analyze this is that in fact there was no transfer of the underlying cause of action, and so we think that... that we... that gets into a very complicated area as to how you value the attorney's fees at the time."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.474,550.582,"Well, you... you don't need a transfer of the... I don't understand what you mean--"
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.582,551.037,"No, I don't either."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.037,552.523,--a transfer of the... the cause of action.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,572.585,573.988,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.081,576.567,Why isn't... why isn't that very similar to this?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,584.33,588.128,"--Well, there is an agreement to pay a fee for a service, and in that sense there is a transaction, yes."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.128,596.302,"Yes, but a... the service is connected to a transaction, namely the conversion of the chosen action into a money payment."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,597.128,598.121,That... that is correct.
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.121,598.986,--this unformed chosen action.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,612.36,629.329,"Well, again, Your Honor, we think that transaction is essentially identical to numerous transactions that take place every day out in the real world where... where taxpayers retain professional services in exchange for a commission or a percentage of the income that's generated."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.329,630.898,That is a problem that occurs to me.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,633.582,634.613,That is absolutely correct.
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,636.721,637.192,How does it work?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,637.192,642.948,--the attorneys here and... and a... and an agent negotiating a book contract for an author or a financial analyst.
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,642.948,649.164,"You... on that, that example, you gave the book contract with the author and you gave, I think, the investor."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,658.452,659.566,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,672.486,675.93,So you say the author... that these people are all in the same--
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,675.93,684.375,--They would have an itemized... excuse me... a miscellaneous itemized deduction for the cost incurred in... in producing income that under the alternative minimum tax would not be allowed.
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,684.375,695.603,Is there any argument... you... you said at the outset that it has to be an itemized deduction subject to the 2 percent rule even if we set aside the alternative minimum tax.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,717.606,746.501,"I will... I will have to allow respondents to speak for themselves to that question, but as far as I'm aware, that is not in dispute in these cases or in any of the cases that have been litigated that... that but... that but for the alternative minimum tax, the way this would have been handled is that there would have been a miscellaneous itemized deduction under section 212 of the code for the cost incurred in producing income, and that the alternative minimum tax, along with, by the way, a large number of other perfectly valid deductions, get disallowed under the alternative minimum tax."
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,746.501,753.849,I... I can't get out of my mind in this case that the mechanics of the particular case may control.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,777.997,778.824,Well--
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.824,782.994,Let's assume that that's true in most of the States.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,782.994,786.792,"--That... that... I know that were... that was the facts, Your Honor, in the... in the Banks case, that there was a check made out to both."
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,788.65,794.322,"So in a very real... in... in a very real sense, in a... in the legal sense, the client just doesn't have control."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,794.322,798.021,"--Well, Your Honor, we disagree with that for, it seems to me, at least three reasons."
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.854,809.909,"Well, he... he did or he didn't, but there was no money there."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,810.652,812.798,"--Well, there was an entitlement to recover."
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,835.423,855.772,"Mr. Salmons, doesn't the plausibility of your argument here rest on the assumption that what the... that the cause of action at the time the... that the plaintiff made the agreement with the lawyer is a cause of action which has the same value as the ultimate recovery that the lawyer gets?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,901.303,903.987,"--Your Honor, two responses to that question, if I may."
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,928.468,930.326,--Even... even the potential lawyer's fee.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,966.379,975.917,"--Well, presumably, Your Honor, if he's already... he's already promised that to the attorney, he would be in violation of his agreement with the attorney if he did so, and his attorney could sue him to recover or the dentist could sue him to recover."
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,975.917,977.419,Then he doesn't have... then he doesn't have dominion over that portion.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,977.419,980.208,"Well, because he's... he's given it away."
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1013.485,1017.982,"No, but the bond coupon has a certain value at the time the father assigns it."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1017.982,1018.604,That's true.
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1018.604,1025.496,The only thing that has to be realized after the assignment of the coupon is the passage of time at which it will be payable.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1036.27,1042.297,"Your Honor, that would be equally true of an assignment of a stock dividend while I retain the stock."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.642,1077.18,So you're... you're--
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1077.18,1078.089,--applying this principle that--
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.089,1084.982,Can I... can I ask you a question relating to the Davenport... what's been referred to as the Davenport theory?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1132.536,1148.595,"--Your Honor, to my knowledge, the... the IRS has had a consistent position that the entire amount of litigation proceeds, including the amount that may be paid to a lawyer under a contingent fee agreement, even in the condemnation context, is... is included in the gross income of... of the taxpayer."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.366,1165.48,Maybe my recollection is wrong.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1166.139,1191.031,"And... and I would point out, Your Honor... and this has to do, I think, with the impact of the new legislation that's been pointed to in the supplemental briefs... that at least six of the court of appeals cases addressing the issue presented in these cases involved claims that would not be covered under the new section 703 because they... they don't involve claims for unlawful discrimination or... or FCA claims or certain Medicare claims--"
2004.03-892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.031,1192.601,--But can... can I ask you to go back for a minute?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1199.288,1199.781,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.781,1208.781,"And you're looking at the control of the plaintiff, for example, over the lawsuit as something that determines whether it's his income."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1261.454,1267.109,"Well, Your Honor, I guess my response to that is that, first--"
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1267.109,1269.793,Other... other than the mercy of the Internal Revenue Service.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1270.332,1279.498,"--Your Honor, the fact of the matter is, is that Congress has looked at... at this issue, and in the new section that I just referred to, section 703--"
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1279.498,1280.157,"Well, but does that happen?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1293.904,1295.473,"--That has occurred, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1295.473,1295.928,Yes.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1295.928,1300.469,And... and Congress responded to concerns about that very result--
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1300.469,1301.212,"Well, but doesn't... doesn't that indicate--"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1301.212,1301.528,--in the new section.
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.528,1304.927,--something basically flawed about your whole theory?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1304.927,1305.299,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1305.92,1309.84,This is not income in any... in any real sense.
2004.03-892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.84,1313.266,Is there any constitutional protection?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1328.177,1329.458,"--I think it would be, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1329.458,1330.035,But I... that's why I ask you.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1359.756,1369.581,"But we do think, Your Honor, that the only limit on Congress' taxing authority would be the Constitution, and I don't see a constitutional violation in disallowing a deduction, but--"
2004.03-892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1369.581,1380.356,"What about an assumption, for example, that when we read the code, we read it with a view towards thinking Congress did not want to produce such unfair results?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1380.356,1381.304,"--Your Honor, if I may."
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1409.539,1410.382,What happened in the cases--
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1410.382,1411.291,That's the proper way to handle that.
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.291,1413.604,--There were cases... we don't have to deal in hypotheticals.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1425.986,1429.124,They were... they were liable for a tax greater than what they took in.
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.156,1433.788,"I mean, there was one that was $99,000, if I remember right."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1433.788,1435.068,--I believe that's correct.
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1438.246,1439.815,Was there a private bill?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1439.815,1440.891,--to enact section 703 to protect--
2004.03-892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1440.891,1441.23,Or what happened?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1442.582,1443.613,"--I do not know, Your Honor."

I've looked at the description of it in the brief, which I had recalled, and what it says is that it did, indeed, involve a taking by the State, and when the State didn't offer what Baylin thought was... was enough, he went to court, he prevailed, and recovered a much larger sum than the State had offered him."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1483.654,1484.852,"--Your Honor, if I--"
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.852,1485.224,And how does that--

2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1522.586,1531.337,Does the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause apply to a Government tax scheme that taxes something beyond the income received?

2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1536.788,1541.412,"Well, at the point where the Government charges more than the taxpayer received--"

2004.03-892,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1544.922,1546.746,"I mean, this is an appalling situation."
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1546.746,1556.067,"--Again, Your Honor, I... I think as a general matter, the... the proper definition of gross income would include the attorney's fees portion of litigation awards."
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1557.265,1560.98,What... what do you we make of the fact that two Senators apparently don't agree with that position?
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1590.785,1591.528,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1597.844,1598.298,I'm... I'm talking about the colloquy.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1599.496,1611.756,"--I... I understand that, Your Honor, and what I'm trying to answer is that the... the legislation itself makes clear that it's included in gross income and an above-the-line deduction is provided, and that the colloquy was referring to a prior version of the bill that would have been retroactive in part."
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.926,1627.36,"--We don't really know who prepared that colloquy anyway, do we?"
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1627.36,1627.982,We do not.
2004.03-892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.982,1629.218,It might have been prepared by the respondents here.
2004.03-892,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,1629.218,1630.127,We do not.
2004.03-892,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.447,1637.929,Mr. Jones.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1637.929,1641.356,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-892,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1653.45,1671.654,What... so what... what about the talent scout who tells the celebrity that he'll take 10 percent of the celebrity's movie proceeds or the management search person that's going to take a... a third of the executive's pay for the first 6 months?
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1681.48,1690.48,"--You mentioned the... the management agent and the... I think you mentioned the talent agent, and there was also mentioned the literary agent."
2004.03-892,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1694.977,1697.206,That's the... that's the question I asked Mr. Salmons--
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1697.206,1697.439,Yes.
2004.03-892,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1697.689,1698.554,--and he gave me the opposite answer.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1698.554,1699.091,--Yes.
2004.03-892,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1705.491,1706.606,And that isn't the question.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1706.606,1706.978,Yes.
2004.03-892,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1706.978,1711.974,The... the problem is you're... you're trying to get a theory in response to him that I think Justice Kennedy is asking about.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1711.974,1712.362,Yes.
2004.03-892,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1712.362,1718.495,"And that theory, which is the problem for your side of the case... that theory has all kinds of implications."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1732.491,1737.98,"Our first choice, our preference for this Court to rule is... is not the partnership or joint venture theory."
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.786,1771.788,It's a partnership theory when you talk about two persons joining together.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1781.365,1781.737,--I--
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.737,1785.535,That's... that's not what I view of a chosen action as.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1787.392,1787.931,--Yes.
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.931,1794.534,"--that the person is entitled to money, and ultimately the amount he's entitled to is determined by the litigation."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1809.479,1810.305,"Well, the--"
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.305,1812.989,--Maybe that's how you view the... the enterprise--
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1812.989,1813.982,--I would like to--
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.982,1814.604,--but I don't think the law does.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1814.604,1822.117,--I would like to suggest to the Court three avenues to reach this result that I have just suggested and the partnership/joint venture theory is only one of those.
2004.03-892,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.117,1825.211,"Well, let's move on to something else because I have a couple--"
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1825.665,1826.78,Okay.
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.584,1875.205,Would you have a different result if they were related?
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1877.267,1880.118,--This Court has a long history of recognizing--
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1880.118,1880.555,Or a good friend.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1880.555,1883.09,--of recognizing sham transactions.
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1883.09,1884.509,"Well, it's not a sham transaction."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1885.69,1886.266,All right.
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.266,1887.381,And I'm just wondering if that--
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1887.381,1895.183,I would like to focus on the gratuitous nature of the cases relied upon by the petitioner and the non-gratuitous aspects of our case.
2004.03-892,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1914.602,1914.902,All right.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1923.973,1925.748,--I--
2004.03-892,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.748,1934.914,"Why do we need the question of the relationship, which Justice Stevens's questions raised, even to arise if... if the principal criterion is going to be economic non-tax purpose?"
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1934.914,1935.862,--I agree completely.
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.403,1942.632,There was no avoidance motive in the--
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1942.632,1942.848,--Yes.
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.848,1944.301,--granddaddy of all cases.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1951.51,1951.882,But we must--
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.882,1953.079,The income tax didn't exist.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1961.13,1964.186,--I'm asking the Court to skip over motive and look at result.
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.398,1990.564,"--Yes, but what if you had the same result but... in terms of the sharing of the expense and the recovery, but it was computed on an hourly basis rather than a percentage basis?"
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,1993.098,1994.484,It would produce a different result.
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2001.422,2008.935,"No, but he could have made... I'm saying he could have said to the lawyer, I'll pay you 30... a... a third of the recovery or I'll pay you $100 an hour."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2008.935,2009.39,"--Well, he--"
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.39,2013.765,"And they come out exactly the same result, but you... but do you treat them differently or the same?"
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2013.765,2017.441,--We treat them differently simply because he didn't.
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.191,2026.729,What is different?
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.729,2027.638,"Well, may I ask one--"
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.638,2027.838,What is different?
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.838,2029.33,--May I ask one other hypothetical?
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2045.099,2047.413,--I... I have difficulty with that question.
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.413,2050.672,But I'm sure it arises fairly often.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2050.672,2056.079,My... I believe that attorneys don't allow themselves to be placed in that position.
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.203,2058.679,"Well, I did very often."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2058.679,2060.786,--But I don't know the answer to your question.
2004.03-892,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2083.943,2090.525,I think probably what's... what's one of the problems here is that the reason this is income is it relates to employment.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2104.088,2112.966,--I believe the problem is that a plaintiff has... I wish I could say this plaintiff is in... engaged in a trade or business and can deduct it or trade or... as a trade or business expense.
2004.03-892,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2112.966,2117.546,"I mean, I suppose that's the reason... that's the reason why it's taxable to begin with, is it relates to employment."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2130.017,2130.222,I understand.
2004.03-892,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2155.28,2157.26,"Well, let me get... get to a different point."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2192.099,2192.554,No.
2004.03-892,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2213.154,2214.473,But what's the difference in principle.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2226.279,2239.615,"I... I am not trying to avoid your question, but I'm trying to clarify that I am not asking this Court to determine who has the income in those cases because there is a large body of law and a large body of statutory law that answers the questions for each of those examples."
2004.03-892,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.809,2246.552,What's your third?
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2252.784,2257.242,"The Oregon question, Your Honor, which I don't think the Court is likely interested in--"
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.242,2258.523,The who?
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2258.523,2259.266,--The... the Oregon question.
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.266,2260.547,The Oregon question.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2260.547,2261.04,The Oregon question.
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.29,2262.155,What is the Oregon question?
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2262.155,2268.636,--The Oregon question is part IV of our brief beginning on page 31 which would not be a national uniform rule.
2004.03-892,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2277.181,2283.953,"Well, what do you make of Professor Davenport's proposal to capitalize the contingency fee as a transaction?"
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2283.953,2287.872,I believe Professor Davenport is completely correct.
2004.03-892,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.699,2301.702,"Well, if you took a settlement... his theory, I take it, was seeing the lawsuit as a capital asset."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2303.393,2303.848,Yes.
2004.03-892,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.941,2308.928,"Well, then whenever you settled a lawsuit, it would be... you'd have to pay capital gains instead of ordinary income."
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2308.928,2309.504,I... I'm sorry.
2004.03-892,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.469,2315.122,I'm sure it's not his theory.
2004.03-892,1,38029,philip_n_jones,,2357.847,2360.94,--I would like to make one additional point in the few seconds I have left.
2004.03-892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.129,2424.636,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2428.806,2430.831,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-892,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2467.899,2468.476,"No, it didn't."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2468.476,2470.871,--I respectfully--
2004.03-892,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.871,2480.736,It... it originated in a case where there could not possibly have been an... an intent to abuse because the... the transfer had occurred before there was any income tax.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2480.736,2481.562,--Justice--
2004.03-892,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.562,2488.788,"I mean, just... just don't... maybe you think that that's what it ought to be, but... but please don't tell us that that is how it originated."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2490.85,2493.905,"--Justice Scalia, I respectfully disagree."
2004.03-892,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.773,2544.449,That's a different argument.
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2548.89,2549.55,Under... under your view--
2004.03-892,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.55,2550.459,--that's fine.
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2550.459,2561.522,"--suppose that the attorney is... is waiting for payment of... of his, say, one-third contingency, and the client just absconds with the money."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2571.803,2578.529,"Well, certainly the attorney has a legal right to those funds."
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.552,2582.965,I'm asking you about the tax consequences.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2582.965,2589.94,"--Well, at... at that point the income wouldn't have inured to the benefit of the attorney."
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2589.94,2599.062,"Well, but I... I thought under your view the moment the client gets the check for the full amount, one-third of it is taxable to the attorney."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2615.846,2618.653,"Justice Kennedy, I... I think the--"
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2618.653,2622.451,"--But on the absconding theory, how... how is it handled from a tax standpoint?"
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2622.451,2631.45,--I believe that for tax purposes the attorney's right to the funds... that's at the moment he receives it.
2004.03-892,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2641.398,2641.648,Aren't... aren't you--
2004.03-892,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2641.648,2644.908,This is an academic question because he would have an offsetting theft loss.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2644.908,2650.314,--I... I think that is an alternative way to... to view it.
2004.03-892,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2650.769,2654.029,"--If... if you view it as the theft loss, you... you maintain your theory."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2660.223,2665.258,"--Justice Souter, I... I--"
2004.03-892,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2665.258,2666.927,I think you better go with Justice Ginsburg.
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.365,2672.688,Like somebody stealing a check out of my mailbox from my employer.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2673.31,2673.582,--Yes.
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.582,2676.57,"So what is your theory, I mean, precisely?"
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2697.087,2698.406,Justice--
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2698.406,2699.521,"Precisely, please."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2699.521,2707.201,--It would not be in the case that the funds are not under the control of the attorney.
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2707.201,2720.63,"Not in the case... it is an assignment of income to B, but not in the case where the funds are not in... when B... when B get... when B, the attorney, gets the funds, he controls them."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2723.215,2725.239,I thought your hypothetical--
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2725.239,2726.559,I want to know.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2760.162,2773.992,"--I would state, Your Honor, that the assignment of income doctrine simply does not apply when the... the client has no control or power of disposition over the income that was subject to the assignment."
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2778.737,2780.308,He did have control.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2811.348,2820.925,"--Justice Breyer, I... I think it's helpful to make a conceptual distinction between the claim, the underlying litigation claim, and the right to receive the funds."
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2842.23,2846.809,That... that would be the same with the theater agent or the commission agent.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2846.809,2863.035,"--We submit, Justice Kennedy, that the nature of the attorney-client relationship is fundamentally different from the types of relationships you cited, and that's because an attorney here is the one who's earning the income."
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2865.551,2867.326,"Well, you could say the same thing for the talent scout."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2867.326,2869.434,I would respectfully disagree.
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2883.468,2889.496,"Your client, in effect, earned the money by having this... undergo this... this discrimination."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2890.134,2891.725,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2004.03-892,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2891.725,2895.812,"--This is not the plumber hypothetical, which is I think quite misleading."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2898.291,2906.109,"--Again, Your Honor, I think with respect to an entertainer, an entertainer necessarily doesn't need an agent."
2004.03-892,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2906.919,2925.699,"Take an investment advisor and the client is not at all... doesn't know anything about the market, and he's got this whiz-bang advisor who makes millions for him that he never could have made on his own."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2925.699,2933.873,I... I think that might be more similar to the attorney-client relationship.
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2946.604,2963.594,"Your... your... you want to fill in the blank, in other words, and say where the assignment of income is such, such that B was in effect the person who really earned the income, unlike Mrs. Lucas'... Mr. Lucas' or maybe Mr. Earl... I don't know--"
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2963.594,2964.543,--That's correct.
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2964.543,2967.615,--husband... the wife didn't earn the income.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,2967.615,2967.781,Right.
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2967.781,2968.441,The husband did.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,3006.253,3008.361,"Well, Your Honor--"
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3008.361,3011.083,"Tell me if I'm wrong, please, on this."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,3011.083,3024.086,"--Again, I... what we're saying is the unique situation of an attorney and a client, it is the attorney who's taking the laboring, or unlike the entertainer example where the... where... or the athlete example--"
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3024.086,3024.912,"Okay, I see. You say double."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,3044.314,3050.342,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and in Lucas v. Earl, it was the assignor who earned the income that was subject to disposition."
2004.03-892,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3050.851,3060.002,I'm not so sure about that because why doesn't the theory that... that applies to the lawyer equally apply to the wife?
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,3071.535,3073.393,"--That is an excellent point, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3073.393,3074.491,You should agree with that.
2004.03-892,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.356,3078.95,Those were less enlightened times.
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,3078.95,3087.245,"Nevertheless... nevertheless, I... I think there may be some... some difference in degree that you might even recognize between the two cases."
2004.03-892,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3156.969,3164.332,"--The Government says on that branch of it, well, the fees... the lodestar fee, that's one thing."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,3178.061,3180.124,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-892,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.48,3199.875,"Thank you, Mr. Carty."
2004.03-892,2,29471,james_r_carty,,3199.875,3200.081,Thank you.
2004.03-892,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3200.081,3203.962,"Mr. Salmons, you have a little over 2 minutes."
2004.03-892,3,21494,david_b_salmons,,3203.962,3204.889,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.03-892,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.111,3349.204,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2004.03-892,3,21494,david_b_salmons,,3349.204,3349.426,Thank you.
2004.03-892,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.426,3350.302,The case is submitted.
