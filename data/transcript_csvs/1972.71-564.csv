1972.71-564,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.883,"We'll hear argument next in 71-564, District of Columbia against Carter."
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,32.342,36.562,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,601.195,603.988,Is that Moor cited in your brief?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,603.988,605.038,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.528,615.741,And the name?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,615.741,621.38,Moor versus Madigan.
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.38,622.869,Thank you.
1972.71-564,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,622.869,627.097,Did you say there was also anther case decided since your briefs were filed?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,627.097,638.382,There are two Second Circuit Court -- Seventh Circuit court decisions and those are both cited and referred to in the Moor versus Madigan case.
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,733.003,774.912,"Well, what you have just said leads me to inquire whether or not it is settled that Section 1983 applies to the District of Columbia at all quite apart from this now a question about liability of a municipality certainly by its legislative history with which I am reasonably familiar having written a couple of opinions in the area, indicates concern by Congress of what was being done in the individual states, particularly the states which had recently been -- involved in the war between the states."
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,805.489,810.193,There are cases that touch on that point.
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,823.891,828.723,"Well, is it included in that statutory language, do you understand it to be?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,828.723,847.6,"There are cases which hold and we do not challenge this point that insofar as the Act applies to employees, that is officers of the municipal corporation, it is operable within the District of Columbia."
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,847.6,850.035,"That is against the police officer, for example, of the District --"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,850.035,852.074,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.074,853.852,"There is no case in this Court is still holding, is it?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,853.852,861.368,"No, I do not think there is Your Honor but we have not challenged that aspect of the holding and we will not cross that here."
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,861.368,869.08,"As I read the holding and I have reread it just now, Judge Bazelon's opinion, that isn't an aspect of his holding."
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,871.222,873.307,"No, he does not."
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,899.06,900.45,As against state action?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,900.45,900.985,Yes.
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,900.985,907.58,"And here we are talking about a federal government, one under the complete control of Congress, the government of the District of Columbia?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,907.58,912.964,"Yes, but the only court then in the District of Columbia was a federal court."
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,912.964,914.112,Exactly.
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,914.112,917.831,So there was no need to give a federal remedy in a federal court.
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,927.524,947.908,"In other words before one even got to the question of the limits of if any of Monroe against Pape, I should think the preliminary question would be whether Section 1983 is applicable to the District of Columbia or its employees, officers or agents at all?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,947.908,950.302,Yes and that issue was not --
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,950.302,955.459,"Not discussed by the Court of Appeals, it's not discussed in either brief, as I understand it?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,955.459,958.46,"No, I do not think it is."
1972.71-564,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,974.398,979.97,There are two decisions what of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,979.97,983.693,I do not remember the source of those opinions.
1972.71-564,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,988.4,999.765,"Well the District of Columbia is surely something more of a federal instrumentality than a new territory, isn't that?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,999.765,1001.918,"Yes it is, of course."
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1043.654,1055.21,"Well, apart from that Mr. Barton, I thought the District of Columbia was sui generis, unique in our structures of governmental entity?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1055.21,1056.226,"It is, however --"
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1056.226,1064.27,"A federal on clave isn't it, territory -- you can't carve states of the district, can you --"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1064.27,1066.04,"No, not without the constitutional amendment."
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1066.728,1071.667,But you can't carve states of the territory as we used to know it?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1071.667,1073.14,Yes.
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1096.342,1104.019,"But doesn't the 18th Clause of Article 1, deal expressly with congressional authority to regulate the affairs of the District of Columbia?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1104.019,1106.044,Yes.
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1106.044,1110.279,So that gave us a rather different status from out of an ordinary territory?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1110.279,1115.15,"Well, I say we have not explored the question."
1972.71-564,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1115.653,1125.029,"Well, I gather you haven't [Attempt to Laughter] contested the applicability of 1983, I think you told us in an action brought under it against a police officer for example?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1125.029,1152.116,"No, we did not bring here the question as to whether or not 1983 was applicable to police officers as distinguished from the District of Columbia and that is perhaps why I am not prepared to answer on that, but if the Court would like a supplemental memo on that issue we would be glad to supply it."
1972.71-564,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1152.116,1170.441,"It has already been pointed out that the compelling reasons for the 1983 as with the Fourteenth Amendment itself was to protect individuals against state action, not against federal action in this context, isn't that true?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1170.441,1172.877,Yes.
1972.71-564,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.776,1180.788,"And the District of Columbia, acts of the District of Columbia are federal acts, are they not?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1180.788,1183.229,"Yes they are, all applicable law here."
1972.71-564,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.198,1203.072,You do have a DC code though that is different from the United States code?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1203.072,1203.572,Oh yes.
1972.71-564,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.701,1239.607,"Would that partly derives from the fact that the Congress would have no power to enact a great many of the laws in the District of Columbia code and make them applicable to the states, is that not so?"
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1239.607,1240.472,Yes.
1972.71-564,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.472,1250.497,Because it has a speed limit for Iowa or California or many of the other criminal acts?
1972.71-564,0,38676,richard_w_barton,,1250.497,1250.72,Yes.
1972.71-564,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1470.899,1481.697,"Thank you, Mr. Barton."
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1483.773,1487.147,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-564,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1596.155,1597.116,Page 143.
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1597.116,1599.462,Yes sir.
1972.71-564,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.729,1764.796,Is the Hurd case cited in your brief?
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1764.796,1766.839,"No, it is not Your Honor."
1972.71-564,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.839,1768.084,Give us that citation again?
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1768.084,1770.732,I’m sorry Your Honor I don’t remember the citation.
1972.71-564,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1770.732,1772.331,What’s the title again?
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1772.331,1781.263,"Hurd versus Hodge, 1947 and followed, it was the very next case in the US reports after Shelley versus Kraemer."
1972.71-564,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1781.263,1791.672,It is stated in the opinion of Judge Bazelon and appears on the foot note on 3A of the appendix to the petition.
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1791.672,1794.625,"Oh, thank you, Your Honor."
1972.71-564,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1794.625,1797.716,334 U.S 24.
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1797.716,1803.193,Thank you.
1972.71-564,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1803.193,1805.366,And what was the other citation?
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1805.366,1817.188,"The other case is Sewell versus Pegelow a decision of the Fourth Circuit 291 F. 2nd, page 196."
1972.71-564,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1817.188,1819.332,"291 F. 2nd, 196."
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1819.332,1820.798,Yes sir.
1972.71-564,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1820.798,1825.76,I think your brother said that there were couple of citations in your brief but I didn’t --
1972.71-564,1,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,1825.76,1830.247,I do not recall that there were in that point because if had ever been raised.
1972.71-564,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2139.308,2145.275,"I don’t like to interrupt your argument, but I have just been looking at Hurd and Hodge, that doesn't involve 1983."
1972.71-564,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2145.275,2146.778,1978?
1972.71-564,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2146.778,2156.364,"It involves -- it involves with a very different section, 1978 which is a present 1982 I think?"
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2156.364,2162.724,"Excuse, excuse me, I believe it does, but I think that the -- I think Your Honor it is correct, it is 1982."
1972.71-564,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2162.724,2167.258,Well and there is no holding in this Court that 1983 includes district --
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2167.258,2171.386,Well I don’t know why 1982 --
1972.71-564,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2171.386,2175.653,"There is no holding of this Court that 1983 includes a District of Colombia, isn't it?"
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2175.653,2183.168,"I guess that is correct Your Honor, but I would suppose if the district were includable in 1982, it also going to be included within 1988."
1972.71-564,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2183.168,2185.196,"Alright, it doesn't necessarily follow."
1972.71-564,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2185.196,2186.652,Surely it doesn't.
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2188.572,2191.359,"Well, I think that they’re both the same."
1972.71-564,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2191.359,2204.661,"1982, we held in Jones against Mayer was an act of Congress authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment which abolished slavery throughout the entire United States and every state and every territory and in the District of Columbia."
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2235.683,2254.091,"Well, I think Your Honor that the objectives of the all the sections of the Civil Rights Act are sufficiently common so as to apply to the District of Columbia as other state or territorial subdivisions."
1972.71-564,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2273.502,2280.601,"But I don't think in 1983, in Monroe rested upon any constitutional dimensions at all, did we?"
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2280.601,2280.938,"Well, we --"
1972.71-564,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2280.938,2291.741,"We did not say that it was unconstitutional to allow municipalities to be sued, did we?"
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2291.741,2292.585,No.
1972.71-564,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2292.585,2294.667,It's purely a question of statutory construction?
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2294.667,2297.693,"Yes Your Honor, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-564,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.04,2331.874,"I don’t quite see the anomaly that you describe Mr. Kaplan saying that it would be a anomaly if in a state a man had an action, a cause of action based on an act of Congress that was designed to prevent states from depriving people of constitution rights, but he didn't have the same cause of action here in the district where Congress is the sole legislative body?"
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2331.874,2340.969,"While Congress is the sole legislative body, the police here are essentially locally controlled just as they are in the Montgomery country or Fairfax county?"
1972.71-564,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.969,2345.648,"Well, what that has got to do with the anomaly under a statute like 1982?"
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2345.648,2371.521,"Well, I suppose Your Honor that what I am saying, to put it in another way is that it would be small consolation through the citizen of the district who finds himself the victim of police brutality to know that he does not have a cause of action against his assailant unlike his neighbor who lives across the district line simply because the district is a federal entity."
1972.71-564,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2371.521,2372.43,"Well, the --"
1972.71-564,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.43,2377.622,Why would he (Inaudible) by his right to vote --
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2377.622,2379.424,Well --
1972.71-564,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.424,2383.545,(Inaudible)
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2383.545,2388.516,"Well, that's not involved in this case of course."
1972.71-564,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2388.516,2407.505,"He might have all sorts of rights in the District of Columbia under that law of the District of Columbia, under the federal common law, statutory law against the policeman or the policeman's superior, but the question is here is the applicability of a statute that was denied to curb actions under color of state law --"
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2407.505,2408.14,Well --
1972.71-564,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2408.14,2412.22,-- and to give and to confer federal jurisdiction upon such actions.
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2416.235,2445.432,"Well Your Honor, I would respond to that only by saying that in the message to Congress from President Grant on March 23 in which he requested them to act this sort of legislation, he said “I urgently recommend such legislation as in the judgment of Congress shall effectually secure life, liberty and property and the enforcement of law in all parts of the United States."
1972.71-564,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2450.351,2459.292,"The question is the legislation with which Congress responded to that message, that is where -- that is what we have to try to follow?"
1972.71-564,2,38676,richard_w_barton,,2459.292,2468.519,"Well, as Your Honor, as it was pointed out there has never been any question raised in this case as to whether it was applicable to district --"
1972.71-564,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2468.519,2478.417,"Right, pointing out that Judge Bazelon has assumed it and cited Hurd against Hodge which on examination doesn't stand (Inaudible)"
1972.71-564,3,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,2478.417,2487.464,As Mr. Barton volunteered I too would volunteer if the Court wishes supplementary memorandum on this point.
1972.71-564,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2487.464,2494.788,Have there been any attempts since Monroe and Pape to get the statute amended to include municipalities?
1972.71-564,3,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,2494.788,2514.589,"The Civil Rights Commission Your Honor in 1966 I believe did suggest, the US Commission on Civil Rights did suggest that legislation should be passed so as to make municipalities liable for 1983 deprivations."
1972.71-564,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2523.43,2528.488,"This is just a matter of curiosity, I wonder if there have been actual bills introduced or hearings in Congress?"
1972.71-564,3,45231,warren_k_kaplan,,2528.488,2547.936,"I am not aware of any, Your Honor, but since the exemption of municipalities came about as a result of a judicial decision by this Court I would think that the reinstatement of municipalities as proper defendants could come about by the same route."
