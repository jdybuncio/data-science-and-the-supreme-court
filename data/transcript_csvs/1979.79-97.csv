1979.79-97,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.559,We'll hear arguments next in California Retail Liquor Dealers against Midcal Aluminum.
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,71.27,75.429,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-97,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,291.523,295.581,"The Rice case was not brought here for review, was it?"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,295.581,296.452,"No, it was not."
1979.79-97,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,299.498,302.217,"If you prevail here, what happens to the Rice case?"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,302.217,310.743,"Well, I would think that if we prevail here that this Court in order to eliminate the uncertainty and confusion caused by that case will overrule the Rice case."
1979.79-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.183,430.491,"Mr. Chidlaw, in response to Justice Blackmun's question, you said you felt we should overrule the Rice case which is I understand is a California case."
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,461.39,481.151,"Well, I would presume, I think your point is well taken Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would presume that if and when this Court rules that our position on the relative importance of the two constitutional provisions, they were correct on that that the California Supreme Court would follow the decision of this Court."
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.352,666.179,"Mr. Chidlaw, just to pursue that for second, supposing they passed a statute that said the wages of a driver of a vehicle transporting liquor from place to place within the state shall be such as has posted by whatever company engaged in the driving business, sort of like this where you post the price for the wholesale and everybody has to follow, why couldn't they do the same thing to regulate wages the same way, either the union or the employer do the posting, make the legislative choice and then prevail over the National Labor Relations Act?"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,666.179,675.414,I can't conceive of any legitimate state purpose in regulating liquor that would also deal with the regulating of the wages for a driver of truck --
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.414,682.822,"Well, they want to be sure that the people who drive are adequately paid or not over paid just as -- what is the state interest at stake here?"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,682.822,690.771,"Well, in this -- in the wholesale to retail, the state interest isn't preventing discrimination among similarly situated retailers for instance."
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.689,710.275,"Well, why wouldn't there be a state interest in having all people who drive large trucks containing liquor be paid the same amount?"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,710.275,725.63,"I can't conceive of any legitimate state purpose in doing that because the Twenty-First Amendment was designed in my opinion, and I think the cases support this, to allow state to regulate liquor within its borders."
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.008,738.731,(Voice Overlap) some drivers you paid a lot more than others while the people that they deliver to have a higher costs for paying for the transportation and same kind of -- economic discrimination that you have in different prices that you charge.
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,738.731,754.448,"I -- that's -- I think there are justifications for the statute here that historic, traditional and do have a relation to regulating liquor and I don't see any justification for regulating in these other areas --"
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.448,761.647,Are there other states statutes or Cartwright Act and some of the others that prohibit price discrimination in California?
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,761.647,765.005,"There are, there's an Unfair Practices Act that prohibits that."
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.363,1010.026,"Well, you would suggest to the state could just have a statute that authorized price-fixing generally if people wanted to engage in it?"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1011.624,1012.378,Are we talking --
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.378,1023.916,"-- in the policy and are -- well, no in liquor that as the state statute it says price-fixing of any kind in the liquor business will not be illegal."
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1023.916,1025.42,That one troubles me just a little bit but this --
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.42,1027.319,"But why, why they say pursuant to our --"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1027.319,1029.242,"Well, my answer to --"
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.242,1031.119,-- under the Twenty-First Amendment?
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1031.119,1039.577,"My answer to you specific would be yes, I think the state would have a power to do that, but I would follow that up with the idea that no state has ever done that to my knowledge."
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.678,1044.83,"Well, it could though in your view --"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1044.83,1046.711,"Well, I think I did in the Parker case."
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.711,1056.284,Well it is -- you certainly say that a manufacturer can set a standard price for all retailers.
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1056.284,1062.693,"Well, that's correct and I do believe that under the Twenty-First Amendment the state does have the power to do that."
1979.79-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.251,1090.559,"Well, there were certainly extra territorial effects in Parker against Brown too where the resin crop was shipped out of state?"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1090.559,1094.637,"Yes, it certainly were."
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.637,1101.305,Let's see why you hesitate on Mr. Justice White's question because it seems to me that the state interest would be -- rather clear there.
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1111.747,1114.75,"No, I think that's true and that's would happens in the monopoly state."
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.205,1127.509,It's not what you think you would say categorically that would be alright for a state to authorize concerted action to restrict the (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1127.509,1138.176,I suppose the hesitation is based on the idea that I don't believe any legislature has ever done that I am not anticipating a legislature would do that because --
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.176,1139.33,"Well, why shouldn't the legislative same policy (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1139.33,1140.497,It does follow.
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.497,1140.859,-- same policy (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1140.859,1145.534,"Yes, absolutely I agree that the power of the Twenty-First Amendment gives the state the power to do that --"
1979.79-97,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1145.534,1146.561,Authorize that?
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1146.561,1147.336,"Right, and whether --"
1979.79-97,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1147.336,1149.708,And thereby exempted entirely from the anti-trust laws?
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1149.708,1157.614,"Right, I suppose what I'm doing is putting myself in the position of legislate and I might have some personal reservations about doing that but yes the state has that power."
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.614,1167.163,And I suppose that you could with the same reason you could -- the state could make price discrimination illegal.
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1175.411,1179.363,"Well, I think again -- I think we run into an equal protection argument --"
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.363,1180.964,"Yes, but they could?"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1180.964,1182.685,"Well, that's the absolute theory."
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.685,1184.991,You mean equal protection what is (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1184.991,1186.07,"Well, for (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.07,1188.781,-- they got more reached than the commerce or what?
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1188.781,1196.274,"Well, the Equal Protection Clause has been held by this Court and I think rightly so to effect the Twenty-First Amendment."
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.416,1220.344,"Mr. Chidlaw, I think I'm not sure I don't suppose the Twenty-First Amendment was argued in the Schwegmann case but (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1220.344,1221.038,Not as far as I know.
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.038,1226.557,"(Inaudible) and I take that you would contend the case should have been decided the other way under Twenty-First Amendment, Schwegmann case (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1226.557,1244.162,"No, no I wouldn't because and I want to be very careful by how I say this but the Schwegmann case did not involve a liquor fair trade statute, it involved the general fair-trade statute and if the state has not acted in the liquor field then the federal law you know may operate and --"
1979.79-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1244.162,1246.73,"Yes, that's right, I remember that."
1979.79-97,0,44148,william_t_chidlaw,,1246.73,1248.839,The -- I would think I'm basically out of time.
1979.79-97,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1298.994,1299.749,Mr. Roth.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1299.749,1302.827,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.999,1436.532,But he handles to the other alone?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1436.532,1449.68,"If he handles it he has no option that's correct Your Honor, but the option is there if he wants to take it and in the state liquor fair-trade on the other hand everything is mandatory."
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.168,1458.458,"Well, the price level isn't?"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1458.458,1458.906,Pardon?
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.906,1460.133,The price level is not?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1460.133,1466.561,No but the industry is and I think that that's very important that the industry at every single level is regulated.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.613,1532.072,Is it fair to infer that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board does not agree that it's necessary to follow the price regulation in order to have effective regulation because as I understand it they acquiesced in the earlier decision indicated in papers filed here that they are sympathetic with the other side of the case?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1532.072,1533.41,Let me put it this way Your Honor.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.364,1571.858,So I take it's fair to infer then that the state's right to regulate could be adequately protected without fair-trade in his judgment?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1571.858,1573.269,"Well, in his judgment --"
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.269,1574.423,Which you would disagree (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1574.423,1587.372,I disagree because we believe it's a legislative judgment and that absent a court decision or on the other hand this Court coming out with a different ruling he would be bound to fall.
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.372,1588.17,Fall?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1588.17,1588.91,Sir?
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.91,1594.389,There's not any issue here about his power of the state to regulate prices.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1594.389,1599.566,"Well, no this -- the state itself you say there is no issue here?"
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.566,1600.69,Yes sir (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1600.69,1602.016,"Well, -- as I understand --"
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1602.016,1604.732,-- there is any state statute setting the price on liquor.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1604.732,1623.898,"No, not to set the price the point is that the state statute says, “That at the tail-end of the state action exemption in effect that the manufact -- I'm sorry, the manufacturer is given the right to set the price that his merchandise should be sold for.”"
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.898,1633.058,"Well, would you be here making the same argument or at least the similar argument if the -- if it -- whether or not to set a price was optional?"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1633.058,1634.683,I don't quite follow Your Honor.
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.683,1646.866,"Well, suppose it was, suppose a producer was free not to post the price but he could and if he did then why retailers were bound to sell at that price?"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1646.866,1650.218,"Well, that would be just like the old Fair-Trade Act but that would be different I think."
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.218,1650.601,What?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1652.438,1657.908,No I would make the argument because here we have the state statutes specifically saying (Voice Overlap) I have to do that.
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.908,1664.393,(Voice Overlap) would you defend that system as exempt from the Sherman Act?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1664.393,1669.519,If the legislative passed then I think it comes under the state exception yes Your Honor.
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.648,1712.082,But under the law isn't -- aren't the producers are all free to agree among themselves -- what on a standard price?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1712.082,1716.498,Only under the Parker versus Rice case where the state told them to.
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1716.498,1725.865,But the -- but you would say that if the producer did get in carrying out their obligations to post prices they can all get together and post the same price?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1725.865,1733.788,"No, I would say not that's a matter for the federal government of the state government to go in and say, “Wait a minute, the state law doesn't let you do that, you can't go and have (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.788,1735.777,"(Voice Overlap) well, nothing prohibited, was it?"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1735.777,1736.028,Pardon?
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.028,1736.6,It doesn't prohibit (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1736.6,1741.224,The California Cartwright Act certainly does and the Federal Sherman Act certainly does.
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.984,1755.955,You would say that Sherman Act would apply if all the producers in this case got together and agreed on the standard price and all posted the same price you would say the Sherman Act would apply?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1755.955,1759.106,"Yes sir, because the state law does not permit that."
1979.79-97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.665,1768.44,"Well, I'll put another way."
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1782.15,1785.3,Yes but if you had the -- it would violate (Voice Overlap) with one time the state did.
1979.79-97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.3,1786.905,(Voice Overlap) milk is milk and whiskey is whiskey?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1786.905,1791.777,The state has set a price on milk and it just that the state recently --
1979.79-97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.777,1800.535,"No, no that's not what I said that the state couldn't tell the producers of milk that you go set your prices whatever way you want to set."
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1800.535,1803.98,"Well, the state milk is not high -- as highly regulated as the liquor industry."
1979.79-97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1803.98,1805.094,That's right.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1805.094,1806.26,But here you have a --
1979.79-97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1806.26,1809.579,"The difference is the Twenty-First Amendment, that's all you got?"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1809.579,1825.349,"Well, I think that state exemption argument comes into it Your Honor in that -- when you have the total regulation and the state saying, “We regulate, we say this and we police this as they do here just because they had an accusation (Voice Overlap) against --"
1979.79-97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.349,1827.909,"(Voice Overlap) Well, I suppose their police nail clippers?"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1827.909,1828.369,"Well, --"
1979.79-97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1828.369,1829.564,Don't make me go too far because --
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1829.564,1831.877,No.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.128,1880.985,"Mr. Roth, would it comply with the California Statute for a wholesaler who handled one line of liquor, wine or liquor, to say that the price to be charged for this line shall be the price that the wholesaler “X” posts for his line?"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1880.985,1881.818,No it would not.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1881.818,1882.411,It would not?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1882.411,1884.966,He would not he would have to say the price from my merchandise is (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.966,1885.699,$6?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1885.699,1888.3,-- $4 a bottle period and that's the limit.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1894.26,1899.479,But every time wholesaler changed his price he'd be free to change as to follow it of course?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1899.479,1901.751,He can but it -- that's true in any business today.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.751,1902.631,"Well, I understand that."
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1902.631,1903.828,And if the (Voice Overlap) department here is --
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.828,1909.989,Except that here everybody has to -- you know there be more prompt compliance with the changes because it would have to under state law.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1909.989,1910.469,That's correct.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.469,1910.824,Yes.
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1910.824,1929.948,What if the producer gets -- what if the producer has a -- knows where all of his -- where is the merchandise goes and all the retailers and the distributors who are handling his goods he -- once a year he gets them together this place and says let's all figure out what my posted price should be?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1929.948,1937.433,I feel very certain that the state government at least and I'm sure that the federal government would come in and they try to put those people in jail (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.433,1941.949,I know but would this -- would you argue that the state law would protect that kind of an agreement --
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1941.949,1943.794,"Not the way it's written, no sir."
1979.79-97,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.794,1950.1,You think that it has to be an individual unilateral determination by the producer?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1950.1,1955.105,"I'm positive that's -- by the way I read the law, it says, “The individual shall set that price.”"
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1955.105,1957.729,"Well, I'm not sure I followed --"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1957.729,1958.21,Yes Justice Stewart?
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.21,1961.629,-- to your answers.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1982.435,1983.462,"Well, they can prosecute --"
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1983.462,1984.83,-- why and how the federal government do it?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1984.83,2000.684,"They can prosecute Your Honor in an area that's not subject to the state regulation (Voice Overlap) -- well, at least concurrent here we under your question as I understand it the anti-competitive activity which is -- would be (Voice Overlap) he's not yet --"
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2000.684,2001.61,He's not authorized (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2001.61,2005.446,-- not authorized would be subject to federal prosecution under (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2005.446,2017.238,"Then your -- that's the thrust of your Twenty-First Amendment argument doesn't go very far, doesn't go nearly so far for example as Justice Black's field."
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2017.238,2035.708,"Well, I believe that under the Twenty-First Amendment as I see it the Twenty-First Amendment within the area of the state regulation inside the state goes as far as to say that if the state passes a law that says a certain act shall occur --"
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2035.708,2036.174,Yes.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2036.174,2039.849,-- that conflicts with the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.849,2042.257,"Well, that's more a Parker against Brown argument, (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2042.257,2042.355,"Well, --"
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2042.355,2042.947,-- I'm talking about the Twenty-First Amendment?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2042.947,2053.196,"Well, I'm talking about the Twenty-First Amendment in this sense Your Honor that there's an argument that only means wet-dry and over here there's an argument that it means something more than wet-dry."
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2059.135,2064.009,But in so far it has not the federal government in your view still retains power to --
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2064.009,2066.688,Until it does preempt this concurrence jurisdiction Justice.
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2066.688,2071.617,"Well, that's so far short of Justice Brandeis' view or Justice Black's view, isn't it?"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2071.617,2073.663,Yes.
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2073.663,2076.706,And Justice Brandeis' view prevailed the Court.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2076.706,2077.085,Right.
1979.79-97,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.085,2080.366,He wrote an opinion for the Court and the Young case.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.366,2081.527,May I ask one other question on the statute?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2081.527,2083.367,Yes sir.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.367,2098.538,We generally thought about prices in Sherman Act context are going up but there is also a line of thinking under Section 2 of the Sherman Act that sometimes by setting a price very low one can drive these competitors out of business and thereby acquire monopoly.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2121.993,2127.332,No I think that when you get into an area where the individual (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.332,2130.141,Is it to an area where his conduct would violate the Sherman Act?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2130.141,2143.093,"Well, if you can prove that he is attempting to go and go further just to set his price not the set a price but to prove some ulterior motive on his part with a combination of some way or another to (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.093,2149.494,New combination in my example is all by himself his -- Section 2 of the Sherman Act he tried to get a monopoly.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2149.494,2156.988,"Well, you will have the problem in California at least that there's a cost relationship there, and he has (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.988,2159.902,"He does it below cost, it's way down."
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2159.902,2160.974,But --
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.974,2162.204,"It's liquor, it's not the general --"
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2162.204,2163.73,Right.
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2163.73,2164.624,I should think he'd be immune?
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2164.624,2168.289,"No, I think then he individually --"
1979.79-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2168.289,2168.635,Yes.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2168.635,2170.8,-- I agree with you Your Honor.
1979.79-97,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2175.025,2175.173,Very well.
1979.79-97,1,25945,george_j_roth,,2175.173,2182.802,Thank you gentlemen.
1979.79-97,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.802,2188.492,Mr. Owens.
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2188.492,2192.135,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.472,2314.465,"Mr. Owens, if in the absence of statute, do you think a posting practice engaged in by sellers would be violative of any of the anti-trust laws?"
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2314.465,2317.552,It's possible under the Container case and possibly the Egyptian case.
1979.79-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.385,2348.775,Are you suggesting that if there -- you say there's a risk of an anti-trust violation in a posting statute or a posting policy?
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2348.775,2357.793,"Both, if the posting statute is simply the requirement to post but the point I'm trying to get across now is that that's not this case."
1979.79-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.121,2421.633,"Well, do you think we made that self examination Parker against Brown if the California has an interest in maintaining the price of the resin market nonetheless it could've done it in a different way?"
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2421.633,2432.726,I -- if I understand your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist I believe that Parker turns on several important features which are not here and which maybe determinative.
1979.79-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2453.643,2456.722,Why do you say that it turns on that?
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2463.771,2476.318,No sir I don't think so because the opinion for the court indicates quite clearly that a state may not simply command what the Sherman Act forbids.
1979.79-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.713,2609.159,What about the Virginia State liquor stores were you go in the state liquor store and you can buy a particular brand only at a particular price and only the state sells liquor?
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2609.159,2619.698,"Yes sir, it's not respondent's position that state monopolization of the business is invalid."
1979.79-97,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.698,2624.544,"Well, why is that any better than what California has?"
1979.79-97,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.544,2627.546,The state (Inaudible)
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2627.546,2641.348,I think Your Honor that we can proceed in greater degree of confidence that if the state takes over the business that some of the interest which are -- which underlies the Sherman Act will be served by the state itself.
1979.79-97,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2680.0,2717.714,"If the states, taking Virginia as one example, decided as a matter of policy that it wanted to discourage the use of hard liquor and encourage the consumption of wines, could it charge for example $25 a bottle fixing its price in its store is $25 a bottle for scotch and bourbon and gin and you use the extra profits to subsidize a lower price on wine perhaps selling it at cost or below its cost?"
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2717.714,2725.135,As a matter of personal preference I would hope they didn't attach that price bourbon but -- yes sir I believe they can.
1979.79-97,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2727.463,2731.188,Twenty-First Amendment would be the source of that authority?
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2731.188,2732.236,That is correct Your Honor.
1979.79-97,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2732.236,2733.975,"Well, plus Parker against Brown wouldn't it?"
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2733.975,2736.022,"Yes, that is also correct Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.79-97,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2736.022,2740.019,Quite apart from the Twenty-First Amendment?
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2740.019,2741.068,Yes.
1979.79-97,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2751.564,2754.352,"No, no I understood this is a state monopoly (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2754.352,2755.056,"Yes, and the state monopoly --"
1979.79-97,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2755.056,2761.159,"-- I mean Parker against Brown would cover that quite apart from the Twenty-First Amendment, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-97,2,32288,jack_b_owens,,2761.159,2763.003,"In my view, that's correct."
1979.79-97,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.003,2769.442,"Well, what does the Twenty-First Amendment if any add to Parker anything at all in your view via-s-via the Sherman Act?"
1979.79-97,3,25945,george_j_roth,,2769.442,2788.132,"Yes sir, I believe that if the state -- let me try at this way, I do not believe that the state action doctrine would simply permit a state to ban importation, the simple act of banning importation in order to cartelize its domestic industry."
1979.79-97,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.816,2795.106,But the Twenty-First would permit it?
1979.79-97,3,25945,george_j_roth,,2795.106,2796.614,Yes it may.
1979.79-97,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.311,2801.466,Is there anything else you can think of?
1979.79-97,3,25945,george_j_roth,,2801.466,2819.068,I think that there are areas where the conflict with the Sherman Act may not be as direct as it is here where the Twenty-First Amendment might give the states greater degree of authority than the state action doctrine.
1979.79-97,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2819.068,2839.563,"Well, a state could engage an action that in other context would be a very clear violation of the non-economic -- certainly the Commerce Clause itself it could totally prohibit the importing into a state of intoxicating liquors, could it not?"
1979.79-97,3,25945,george_j_roth,,2839.563,2839.911,Yes sir.
1979.79-97,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2839.911,2847.154,"But you could not do for a lumber or eggs or even garbage, could you?"
1979.79-97,3,25945,george_j_roth,,2847.154,2848.456,That's correct.
1979.79-97,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2856.46,2861.198,Or impose a very high duty or tax I think which you couldn't do under the Commerce Clause?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,2861.198,2862.802,Yes.
1979.79-97,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2862.802,2866.744,Could it bar imports of anything except liquors?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,2866.744,2868.156,No.
1979.79-97,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2868.156,2871.383,Just one category under this -- under the Twenty-First Amendment?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,2871.383,2872.19,Yes.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2945.916,2959.856,"Of course that Idlewild decision is sought to be, indeed can be wholly explain in the basis of proposition that that was international commerce not interstate commerce."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,2959.856,2967.327,Yes sir and I think you can go down the line on these cases and find one factual distinction or another but if I'm reading the (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2967.327,2970.759,That's more than just a factual distinction.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,2993.68,3000.987,"I think that's absolutely right and certainly I can debate with the author of the Idlewild and Seagram decisions, but I believe that what is happened --"
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3000.987,3005.807,Mr. Justice Black in dissent in that case saw it as simply as sale in New York State.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3005.807,3007.201,Yes sir.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3037.954,3044.256,"Seagram held that New York could invalidly do it precisely what they done, did it not?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3044.256,3046.175,Seagram was on the face opinion as you remember.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3046.175,3047.054,"Yes, yes."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3047.054,3048.53,It was not and as applied case.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3048.53,3051.133,"Yes, because the -- it have been state."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3051.133,3053.174,Yes sir.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3083.929,3098.248,"Because that was not a Sherman Act case as such, it was a constitutional attack upon the validity of the New York provisions which had been tried and the provisions have been upheld in the New York Court -- state court system."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3101.333,3104.129,"Yes sir, in the Seagram's case, there were variety --"
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3104.129,3110.532,But among other claims where the claims that this -- this what New York could permitted violated the Sherman --
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3110.532,3110.972,Yes sir.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3110.972,3111.721,-- antitrust act?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3111.721,3114.638,"It was a burden on commerce claim, there was an antitrust claim when you reach the (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3114.638,3117.342,"Equal projection, due process?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3117.342,3117.884,Yes sir.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3131.316,3139.641,"But that involved effect as I remember in other states outside of the State in New York, that was the claim, was it not?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3139.641,3141.003,"Yes, by the way statute worked, that's correct."
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3141.003,3142.635,Right.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3142.635,3144.519,But what you have before us --
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3144.519,3160.352,"It wasn't there at least to negative implication that had the effect clearly confined to New York whatever that effect might have been, it would have been immunized from antitrust vulnerability by the Twenty-First Amendment."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3160.352,3161.646,As I say you were the author of the opinion (Voice Overlap) that I believe --
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3161.646,3163.802,"Well, I'm not asking you, you're the reader of the opinion?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3163.802,3171.609,"I believe the Robinson-Patman portion of the opinion takes away the native implication, that's your basis because there's no extraterritorial effect there."
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3171.609,3173.529,No.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3173.529,3190.209,"And in any event, I believe the sense of the subsequent decisions of this Court is to adopt the standard announced in that case as controlling in these cases."
1979.79-97,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.67,3208.158,What about vertical price fixing?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3212.797,3216.289,"Delusional price fixing apart from the act, apart from the information (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.289,3225.991,"Well, before he announces his price, he gets his retailers and distributors together and they all agree on a price."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3225.991,3228.11,Not authorized by --
1979.79-97,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.11,3231.228,Not authorized prohibited.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3231.228,3234.487,I don't think I know the answer to that.
1979.79-97,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.927,3246.666,You don't need the horizontal price fixing?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3246.666,3254.113,"Precisely, precisely."
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3298.652,3312.058,Didn't Frankfort Distilleries involve the effects of conduct and violation of the antitrust laws on states other than the legislating state?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3312.058,3317.029,Yes sir as well as intrastate effects.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3317.029,3318.932,But wasn't the former emphasized --
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3318.932,3319.208,Yes sir.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3319.208,3320.911,-- and relied upon?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3320.911,3329.117,Mr. Justice Black stressed the extraterritorial effects in Frankfort probably because of his own personal views about the (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3329.117,3330.772,Perhaps but it was a Court opinion.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3330.772,3331.68,Right.
1979.79-97,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.781,3360.066,What year was that?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3360.066,3366.546,Burke v. Ford?
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3378.979,3382.393,"Mr. Owens I haven't read Burke v. Ford, I just don't remember."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3389.31,3390.137,No.
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3390.137,3391.745,And then really isn't to help as much.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3391.745,3394.201,"Yes, it does sir in this respect."
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.993,3452.931,"That's a little bit like the argument to the federal government still retains the power to put the minimum wages and safety standards and other things involving the liquor industry, it's a little bit like, that's the same argument that the federal power over the liquor industry within California is not -- has not been surrendered through the Twenty-First Amendment."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3452.931,3453.484,That's correct.
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3463.853,3484.407,"There's an intermediate position in Mr. Justice Frankfurter expounds in his concurring opinion Frankfort which I think would be sufficient to defeat you, in other words, that if that the Twenty-First Amendment in effect gave the power to the state to act without violating the Sherman Act."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3484.407,3484.926,Yes sir that --
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3484.926,3491.017,He concurred there on the ground that Colorado had not approved of the combination state there.
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3491.017,3491.278,Right.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3491.278,3492.548,That's correct.
1979.79-97,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3514.414,3532.372,"Mr. Owens, you would concede I take it in your reference to Burke against Ford that in an unargued percuriam decision of this Court it's two pages long doesn't have the same precedential way, there's an orally argument argued case followed by our written opinion."
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3532.372,3546.075,"Yes sir just as I would argue that the National Railroad case that he relies on which is summary affirmance is about the same situation, but I think it's a question of concept more than question of holding."
1979.79-97,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3608.633,3630.793,"Well, don't you think if the legislature is responsive to interest in the state the same way other supervisory boards would be and if it declares a flat ban or a flat approval that is as much state action as a legislative authorization to some subordinate of the legislature?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3630.793,3633.228,I agree that it is much state action.
1979.79-97,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3638.879,3640.627,Does that make sense to you logically?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3640.627,3642.034,"Yes, it does in this respect."
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3694.878,3709.716,"Mr. Owens, I understand your argument that the scheme is in direct conflict with federal antitrust policy, do you contend that anyone has whose complied with the California law has actually violated the Sherman Act?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3709.716,3711.44,No sir.
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3711.44,3716.952,"If there is no Sherman Act violation, how do we find the conflict with the Sherman Act?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3716.952,3721.222,"Mr. Justice Douglas, manage to do within Schwegmann."
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3721.222,3724.171,You also find a difficult on Judge plain how he did it?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3724.171,3724.822,No sir.
1979.79-97,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3739.694,3750.159,"Well, do you think the Sherman Act is somehow more important than say the Fair Labor Standards Act or any Clean Error Act or any number of other acts enacted by Congress?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3750.159,3751.946,"No, not necessarily I don't think it's more important --"
1979.79-97,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3751.946,3761.528,"And even if you do think so, are we allowed to think so or say so?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3761.528,3764.087,I think that it is a very --
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3764.087,3777.105,"May I just go one step further with you on my -- if there is no violation of the Sherman Act, is it because there's no concerted action or is it because following a state law it cannot be a violation of the Sherman Act?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3777.105,3779.367,I think there are two possible reasons why it's not.
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3784.755,3786.484,Right.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3786.484,3789.959,-- there is no independent contract as required by the Sherman Act.
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3790.957,3792.046,Right.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3792.046,3809.836,Second reason is that even if you -- you if I'm wrong about that if I understand some of the passages in your opinion in Candor and Mr. Justice Blackmun's writing there may be a public policy exception to antitrust liability where the activity was mandated by the state.
1979.79-97,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3809.836,3834.655,"But the extent that you rely on the first reason that there would still be no Sherman Act violation if we held the statute that the California statute bad and the various people in the business continue to do exactly the same thing by independent decision and say this is the price making him recommended rather than the mandate that which -- would that's obvious, I'm not saying (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3834.655,3838.051,That would be a conscious parallelism kind of question relating to communication.
1979.79-97,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3838.438,3844.135,You said there may be an immunity if they're following state law.
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3847.174,3849.304,I don't believe the Court as a Court has said it Your Honor.
1979.79-97,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3851.311,3856.719,(Voice Overlap) suggesting if they're following state law there ought to be an immunity?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3856.719,3864.077,Yes Your Honor and I find support for that in particular opinions which have not yet commended to the Court.
1979.79-97,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3879.353,3882.157,And important bodies of federal law too?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3882.157,3882.839,Yes.
1979.79-97,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3890.316,3901.511,"Well, how are we to judge? If Congress has an access a hundred statutes and each contains flat prohibitory language, which ones are important and which one aren't?"
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3901.511,3906.728,I think it's the same analysis that the Court is required to go through and undertakes a preemption analysis.
1979.79-97,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3910.131,3914.173,What if all these hundred is very clear and it prohibits?
1979.79-97,4,32288,jack_b_owens,,3914.173,3933.302,"Then as I understand the Twenty-First Amendment, if it's not simply the question try to ban importation and it isn't really at the core of a prohibition or temperance related system, federal interest is very likely to prevail."
1979.79-97,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3934.504,3935.134,Thank you gentlemen.
