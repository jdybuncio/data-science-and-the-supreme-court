1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.727,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Payner.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,55.119,59.242,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.833,661.5,"General McCree, am I right in thinking that Congress made some changes of its own in these Federal Rules of Evidence when they were transmitted by this Court?"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,661.5,693.117,"Indeed, the Congress did and perhaps most relevant to -- to our purposes here, it changed the last sentence from other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to its authority or words to that effect to pursuant to statutory authority which was -- we submit intended to indicate that the source of the Supreme Court's authority to amend would be the Congress of the United States."
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,693.117,704.409,"You say, I take it, Mr. Solicitor General that this is an express declaration by the Congress on the jurisdiction of the federal courts and of this Court?"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,704.409,705.92,That's -- that is our submission.
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,758.13,758.745,Let me put it in another --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,758.745,760.501,-- to exclude relevant evidence.
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,760.501,783.004,"To put it in another way, are you saying that up to the time of the adoption of Section 402, the powers of the Court -- the inherent powers of the Court may well have embraced this kind of supervisory authority, but that Congress has deliberately withdrawn that jurisdiction from the courts now."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,783.004,785.195,I would agree with that statement precisely.
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,785.195,785.431,That's -- that's --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,785.431,810.548,"And this Court has in the past prior to the adoption of Section 402 purported to act pursuant or to recognize the use of supervisory powers, but -- and even in the area of the admission of relevant evidence and we don't say that the Court doesn't still possess supervisory powers for other purposes."
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.929,850.177,"Well, supervisory power is -- is really just another word for the power that any appellate court has to correct non-constitutional errors, isn't it?"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,850.177,860.325,I would agree with that except I would -- I would include a trial court as well in that and I think it does have power.
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.784,865.302,Right.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,865.302,865.468,And in the course.
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,865.468,867.31,And -- and it's the --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,867.31,867.59,And to correct error.
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,867.59,883.204,"-- not the power but the function of a -- an -- of an appellate court to correct prejudicial errors and to reverse judgments if prejudicial errors have occurred and if they're non-constitutional errors, you can call that supervisory power if it pleases you but it --"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,883.204,893.194,"Unless -- yes, we would agree Mr. Justice Stewart and we would say that the Congress has a power to proscribe rules or procedure in evidence for the federal courts."
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.083,950.76,"Well, I take it then, you say that the -- that the rules and that Section in particular tells the courts that unless you find some constitutional ground for exclusion or unless you find some ground for excluding expressed in these rules."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,950.76,952.027,Or a statute.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.027,956.726,"Or some other statute, you may not exclude the relevant evidence."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,956.726,960.178,That's the way we read Rule 402 and we say --
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.178,969.698,"And that -- and that prior to the rules, the rules of evidence were -- you found them in the books, the courts had made them up."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,969.698,970.768,"Well, more or less --"
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.768,971.483,And --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,971.483,972.862,-- but not out of context.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.862,979.937,But -- but then they'd -- then -- then it was decided to -- to reduce the Rules of Evidence to a written -- to a set of rules --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,979.937,980.132,Precisely.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.132,983.096,-- and then the Congress turned it into a statute.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,983.096,984.506,Precisely.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.008,1011.188,That was a --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1011.188,1011.721,But --
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.721,1015.224,That was a -- that power was eliminated.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1015.224,1027.626,Was -- was severely circumscribed and 402 specified the -- the basis by which relevant evidence could be excluded thereafter.
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1027.626,1034.223,"If 402 were not in the books, Mr. Solicitor General, would you be here today?"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1034.223,1035.358,I will be here today.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.128,1052.147,That was inconsistent with our standing cases.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1052.147,1053.252,That indeed it is.
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1053.252,1055.406,That will be a different basis entirely.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1055.406,1072.048,It would be that the power exists but it should not have been exercised in this instance because it amounts to an utter circumvention of all of the standing jurisprudence that this Court has worked out in a -- on a case by case basis over the years.
1979.78-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.048,1086.591,"Would it be another way of saying the same thing, General McCree, to say that concededly, the Courts of Appeals have supervisory power but that this Court has supervisory power to supervise their supervisory power or --"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1086.591,1092.328,"Well, there seems to be no question of that and this course is the end of the road."
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.328,1106.105,"General McCree, before you get into your second argument, do I correctly understand that your first argument asks us to overrule Miranda because the giving of Miranda warnings as I understand is not constitutionally required."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1106.105,1115.494,"Well, the Miranda warnings are under the Fifth Amendment right to be -- not to be required to --"
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.494,1119.116,They're -- they're a public protected rule to protect the Fifth Amendment right but they --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1119.116,1119.236,To protect --
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.236,1121.588,-- are not themselves constitutionally required.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1121.588,1139.474,"Well, the Fifth Amendment specifically provides that no person shall be required to incriminate himself and I would say that on that basis, there is authority for the Miranda rule if it's to be a precaution against self-incrimination."
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.41,1161.13,But it's not a rule proscribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority and it's not provided by the Constitution of the United States that the evidence -- that a confession given without the appropriate warrant -- warning shall be inadmissible.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1161.13,1166.63,It's -- it's not expressly provided but this Court has found it to be required.
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.63,1176.747,"Well, this -- doesn't Michigan against Moseley clarify that and make it rather clear that Miranda is not a constitutional -- constitutional mandate of their requirement."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1180.816,1200.642,"Well, I don't think it does and I -- I want to -- I want to think just a moment more about my response to it and I come back to -- to my earlier answer that the Fifth Amendment does specifically protect the person against self-incrimination."
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.642,1201.209,Right and of course --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1201.209,1201.407,And --
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.407,1204.915,-- the Fourth Amendment protects these people against having their briefcases searched (Inaudible)
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1204.915,1206.844,It -- it protects Mr. Wolstencroft.
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.844,1207.54,"Right, right."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1207.54,1209.66,It doesn't protect Mr. Payner.
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.66,1209.822,Right.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1209.822,1213.952,Mr. Payner has no more right to invoke the Fourth Amendment here than a --
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.952,1214.419,I understand.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1214.419,1216.36,-- a perfect stranger to it.
1979.78-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.36,1228.312,"It would be difficult to imagine why the -- this Court reversed the Supreme Court of Arizona in Miranda against Arizona if the Constitution didn't require Miranda warnings, would it not?"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1234.822,1238.651,That was my response I thought to Mr. Justice Stevens that --
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1238.651,1239.261,And there were three or four --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1239.261,1240.572,-- there is the express --
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1240.572,1241.984,-- companion cases in Miranda.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1245.784,1251.394,And this is an ex -- and there is an express guarantee against self-incrimination and this Court --
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1251.394,1253.012,Compulsory self-incrimination.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1253.012,1265.849,Compulsory self-incrimination and this Court equated the failure to give these warnings as subjecting a person to that -- that risk.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.849,1295.691,"Well at least absent those warnings is somebody's -- the state is in cons -- in constitutional trouble, but the Miranda and some other cases indicated that those -- these particular prophylactic rules might not be the only satisfactory protection that a state could satisfactorily give to the Fifth Amendment right, but absent some other protections and absent these warnings, a state conviction is vulnerable."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1295.691,1295.928,Yes.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.704,1318.84,This is the --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1318.84,1322.222,"-- to exclude this very relevant, very probative evidence."
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1322.222,1334.977,"Should the Court read it as having Congress say to us that from this time on, you will not make any rules except within the framework of 402."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1334.977,1336.387,I think that's exactly what the Congress --
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.387,1338.46,That would leave Miranda in --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1338.46,1338.922,Rules to --
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1338.922,1339.361,-- intact.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1339.361,1343.682,Rules relating to the exclusion of evidence.
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1343.682,1344.212,That's -- that's the one.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1344.212,1344.731,Yes.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.731,1345.016,"Well, (Voice Overlap)"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1389.735,1391.42,"No, I don't -- I don't say you wouldn't have the --"
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.42,1392.203,"Why not, why not?"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1392.203,1392.529,-- power to --
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.529,1403.753,"We would be then -- exclude the evidence, this very evidence, this very evidence that is involved in this case would then be inadmissible."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1403.753,1409.235,"If -- if you felt constrained by the Constitution to do that, you wouldn't be wrong."
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.235,1429.814,"Well, do you think Alderman is -- after all is a case of -- in there, the -- the prisoner has a case of controversy with the state and the state is trying to convict him by evidence that was illegally seized and we have said, “Well, the evidence -- the-- it wasn't seized in violation of you rights and so you can't object to it.”"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1433.512,1442.649,"Well, you -- you've afforded a remedy to a person whose rights, whose constitutional rights you found to have been violated."
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.437,1445.836,"Well, the Alderman and those standing --"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1445.836,1446.088,In those cases.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.088,1449.515,"-- cases have denied, have denied a remedy to --"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1449.515,1455.473,But you've denied it to the person whose rights were not -- whose rights were not --
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.473,1458.346,"Well, he's being put in jail by illegally seized evidence."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1458.346,1471.844,But you've held that -- that A's rights cons -- that are protected by the Fourth Amendment were not violated by a search of -- of -- by the invasion of a right of privacy of B.
1979.78-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.844,1485.622,Whereas the District Court here held that they had to create standing in somebody in order to enable him to litigate unconstitutional conduct of the Government even though the particular defendant before them was unable to under our case.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1485.622,1493.221,"Was it -- indeed, the District Court here indeed found that Payner's rights had not been violated at all."
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.693,1515.122,But I --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1515.122,1516.99,-- or a right created by a statute or a rule.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.99,1535.706,"I still think -- I still think under your first argument that in -- in effect, you're saying Congress is -- has now forbidden us to -- to overrule any of our prior evidence cases."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1535.706,1538.551,"Well, I don't make that contention and --"
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.551,1538.756,"Well, if --"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1538.756,1541.272,And I don't think we have to decide that here today.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.765,1560.461,"But what if we decided that you get to your second argument and suppose we, thinking about your second argument that this ruling is inconsistent with Alderman and the other standing cases."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1560.461,1561.705,It is.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1561.705,1572.174,"And we say well, it certainly sounds like -- like it's inconsistent when we now -- we now think Alderman is wrong and we would like to reverse it."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1576.302,1583.271,"Of course if you -- if you reverse, you mean to exclude evidence that infringes --"
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.271,1584.635,Exactly.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1584.635,1586.793,-- A's right but at B's insistence?
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.793,1590.249,Exactly.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1590.249,1594.23,I think you'd probably find a constitutional underpinning for it.

1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1603.575,1611.762,"Well, it's hard to -- it's hard for me to divorce the notion of standing from the notion of a constitutional right having been violated."
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1619.667,1621.686,Up to now we have said they couldn't (Inaudible)
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1621.686,1624.846,"And conceptually, it's difficult to separate these."
1979.78-1729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1626.625,1629.507,"Well, now you see the first man's rights are violated."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1633.664,1635.105,They -- they did not use it against him.
1979.78-1729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1635.105,1637.627,"So he -- he wasn't incriminated, was he?"
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1637.627,1639.864,"As a matter of fact, that's correct."
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1783.006,1787.942,Genreal McCree may I return for a second to my question about Miranda because it does -- it does trouble me.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1793.323,1798.123,"Is that the use of the evidence to impeach, for impeachment purposes?"
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.123,1798.777,"No, no."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1803.1,1803.26,Alright.
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.26,1805.464,The question whether it was retroactive in effect.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1851.641,1852.242,Well --
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1852.242,1854.207,"On the other hand, if --"
1979.78-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.207,1856.807,Maybe there was no jurisdiction to decide Miranda but it's on the book.
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1856.807,1874.063,My opinion does say of course what my bother Stevens says it says but Miranda couldn't -- this Court wouldn't have had power to reverse the judgments of convictions in Miranda had it not been construing the United States Constitution.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1874.063,1888.112,"I have said before that I have a conceptual difference -- difficulty with this problem on habeas of course, a state judgment may be reviewed only for a constitutional violation."
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.594,1894.782,"Your time has fled, Mr. Solicitor General."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1894.782,1896.346,Then I should follow my time.
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1897.097,1904.575,Let me ask you one question though which relates to justify what we've been focusing on.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1932.678,1939.234,"Unless the Court adopts a rule pursuant to statutory authority, yes Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1939.234,1940.522,How can we go that far?
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1948.078,1948.405,Our --
1979.78-1729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1948.405,1950.179,Chambers against Florida?
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1951.158,1953.454,None of those was a supervisory power case --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1953.454,1953.563,Our --
1979.78-1729,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1953.563,1954.682,-- they couldn't have been.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1954.682,1956.777,Our suggestion is that the Court --
1979.78-1729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1956.777,1957.784,Miranda couldn't have been (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1957.784,1973.674,"-- reverse the decision of the -- of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, remand the case and require it to address the questions that it did not address in this very brief per curiam opinion and we believe they'll find no taint."
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.849,1985.61,"Mr. Solicitor general just to -- I did not -- sure I understood what your -- one of your answers, your recent answers."
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2007.833,2009.048,I think I would have to.
1979.78-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.048,2010.658,Yes.
1979.78-1729,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2010.658,2014.809,Thank you.
1979.78-1729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2014.809,2015.758,Mr. Kleinman.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2015.758,2018.919,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2057.737,2065.475,Do you question the authority of the Congress to withdraw specific areas of jurisdictions from the federal courts?
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2065.475,2071.089,"No, I do not -- I do not question that authority of the -- of the Congress to do that."
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.149,2108.48,"I believe, Mr. Kleinman, before you go too far --"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2108.48,2108.986,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.986,2120.447,"-- let me -- I'm just -- to take you on that to testify, to be compelled to testify against himself, we don't need to get any more authority to deal with that than we have under the Constitution, do we?"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2120.447,2123.212,"Well, the question is whether the evidence can be excluded."
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.624,2165.583,"The same was true in Mallory, was it not, in the Mallory case that followed McNabb?"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2165.583,2166.148,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2166.148,2167.119,And Anderson.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2167.119,2167.407,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.968,2241.177,Why is that?
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2247.025,2247.48,That's correct.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.48,2248.815,-- and seized the evidence.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2248.815,2250.218,"There would be no difference, Your Honor if they killed, I they --"
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.218,2252.388,I mean under their -- under their argument.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2252.388,2255.133,"According to their argument, if they killed Mr. Wolstencroft."
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.102,2265.304,"Well, the -- the Internal Revenue Service agent might be in a great deal of trouble, but the question is about the evidence."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2265.304,2269.255,That's correct. Could the evidence be excluded if that had happened?
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2304.316,2304.437,You said --
1979.78-1729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2304.437,2306.273,Mr. Kleinman.
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.273,2308.438,"-- affirm his convictions of murder, couldn't they?"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2308.438,2309.398,"Well, I'm not sure of that."
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.398,2309.885,Could they?
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2309.885,2321.659,I'm not sure of that because I do not believe as I read some of the cases that a federal agent in connection with his duties for the federal government may not be subject to criminal prosecution under state law.
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2322.2,2324.506,This wasn't a federal agent.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2324.506,2325.622,He was a federal agent.
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.708,2328.527,He -- he hired private investigators.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2328.527,2329.512,"Yes, but this Court found that he --"
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2329.512,2330.503,Wasn't he?
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2330.503,2330.893,"Yes, he was."
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2330.893,2331.75,Wasn't he?
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2331.75,2334.681,"But he was an agent of the Government, the Court so found."
1979.78-1729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2337.779,2338.862,"Mr. Kleinman, before you go on --"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2338.862,2339.025,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2339.025,2341.749,-- where is Rule 402 here on the papers that we have.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2341.749,2353.765,Rule 402 is cited -- page 15 of the -- of the respondent's brief.
1979.78-1729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2353.765,2354.419,"Alright, fine."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2360.641,2369.264,"I might say that the Government has talked about ratifying an act in the -- in their brief, they talk about distasteful practices."
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.879,2401.722,And to lie about it.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2401.722,2402.602,That he said that there --
1979.78-1729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.602,2404.485,"And that's not reprehensible, lying."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2404.485,2425.258,"I didn't say it was not reprehensible, Your Honor, but I suggest that the commission of a felony by stealing this man's property was a more heinous crime than report -- than failing to state on a tax return that a man had an account in the Bahamas because that would not necessarily indicate that any crime was committed by him other than that statement made."
1979.78-1729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.249,2466.21,"Mr. -- Mr. Kleinman, what you're talking, I take it, about the supervisory power of the federal judiciary as a whole, not of each in the Court of Appeals independently."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2466.21,2466.57,Correct.
1979.78-1729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.786,2499.554,"So if the Seventh Circuit case that General McCree mentioned is affirmed by the Court of Appeals and there was a conflict in the Seventh Circuit and the Sixth Circuit on this in -- in your case, that conflict would presumably, ultimately have to be resolved by this Court."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2499.554,2500.351,I believe it would.
1979.78-1729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.613,2519.298,"So they -- it -- it isn't a question -- as I recall the Jacobs case, it was the policy of U.S. Attorneys in the Second Circuit, something that the Second Circuit didn't purport to say was something ought to be followed in the Ninth Circuit or the Fifth Circuit or the Fourth Circuit."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2522.683,2527.725,It was an administrative policy of the Attorney's -- U.S. Attorney's office to do certain things.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.857,2567.107,"But the -- wholly aside from Rule 402, the Government says that evidence would be admissible under our -- under the --"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2567.107,2567.693,That's correct.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.693,2570.097,-- under the standing cases.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2570.097,2573.341,"Well, the question -- the standing cases is another matter, Your Honor --"
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.341,2577.358,"Well, I know but -- but you certainly have to get by those two."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2577.358,2578.381,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2583.406,2587.341,"Well, whatever you rely on, you have to get by that one point, don't you?"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2587.341,2588.268,The standing point?
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2588.268,2588.69,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2588.69,2594.412,I don't -- I don't understand the -- the matter of standing to be involved in the question involving the Fifth Amendment.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2611.272,2615.365,What was involved in Alderman?
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2618.699,2619.072,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2665.669,2674.167,What if we had a -- what if we had a treaty that would've allowed us to “extradite” that -- that -- those records.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2674.167,2687.465,"Well, I'm -- if there were such a treaty, then I would assume he did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy because he would know that the Court -- that this Government recognizes the fact that they could get those records and that if he knew that, he had no legitimate expectation."
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.465,2693.942,This is a -- this -- your submission that he really had standing because he had an expectation of privacy.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2698.741,2698.932,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.106,2709.498,Because --
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2709.498,2710.892,-- standing.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.892,2720.519,"I think that -- I -- I think that if you're right about that, the 402 argument is beside the point and so were the standing cases."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2720.519,2720.799,I cite --
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.799,2721.261,-- to be the points.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2721.261,2723.619,That's true.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2857.816,2859.606,Where do we -- where do we find that out?
1979.78-1729,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2859.606,2860.018,What about that –-
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2860.018,2863.169,The -- the hearings before the House of Representatives.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2863.169,2866.397,We -- we -- you're suggesting we can judicially notice that.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2866.397,2867.83,"I think you can notice that, yes."
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.594,2892.137,The Solicitor General has told us that there's a pending prosecution arising out of the same -- same thing.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2892.137,2893.368,"Yes, I said there were two or three."
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.054,2896.984,But they're still persisting with the Vasquez case.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2896.984,2898.017,Vasquez is another.
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.618,2915.402,"Of course if that's true, then we don't really need any deterrent, do we?"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2915.402,2924.691,"Well, except that you cannot say that that in this particular case, if it's held that that evidence is admissible, the Government can very well say okay, now we're going ahead with it."
1979.78-1729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2933.773,2941.171,Justice -- Justice Stevens just pointed out that the executive branch responded to congressional hearings -- any statement from this Court at all.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2941.171,2943.556,"No, not true."
1979.78-1729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2958.193,2965.947,I thought you said that it would -- the -- all these prosecutions were dropped after the -- they were criticized in the congressional hearing.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2965.947,2969.458,"No, they were dropped -- no, the -- this -- this case in itself, Your Honor."
1979.78-1729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2979.637,2983.082,So the hearings in Congress really didn't amount -- amount to all that much.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2983.082,2995.359,"Well, the hearings -- the Commissioner of Internal Revenue stopped any -- not further proceedings but further activity of agents in acquiring evidence under the tax haven."
1979.78-1729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2995.359,2996.689,To refer the tax evasion.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,2996.689,2998.09,That's right.
1979.78-1729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3031.69,3037.461,If this Court reverses the Sixth Circuit presumably but the prosecutions will continue.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3037.461,3041.071,I have no knowledge of what they will do if this Court does that.
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.348,3054.533,"That's a requirement, isn't it?"
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.533,3065.877,"Mr. Kleinman, at least for me, you -- you covered the standing point so swiftly that I think I missed it."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3072.108,3084.999,My understanding of the question of standing is that the person who objects to the introduction of evidence obtained in an illegal search must have standing to object to that.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.946,3139.521,The District Court rejected that.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3139.521,3140.178,Yes it did.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.178,3143.25,And it -- and -- and it excluded the evidence on another basis.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3143.25,3143.705,That's right.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.422,3147.552,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3147.552,3148.391,-- due process rights.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.391,3149.31,"Yes, I understand that."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3149.31,3149.674,That's right.
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.395,3164.97,"Well, suppose we agree with the District Court, what -- what's your answer to the standing cases if -- if we agree with -- if we happen to disagree with you and agree with the District Court standing --"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3164.97,3165.621,If you --
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.621,3169.858,-- that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in this record.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3169.858,3177.396,"Well, then I assume that this Court would then have to hold that my client did not have or the respondent did not have standing to object to the search on that basis."
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.396,3178.955,"Alright, then -- then what -- then what will you do?"
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3178.955,3182.091,Then we -- we'll proceed to the next basis upon which the Court ruled --
1979.78-1729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.091,3182.323,Due process.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3182.323,3197.152,"-- and that is that under the Due Process Clause, there was a -- a violation of -- bad faith hostility violation insofar as an individual's constitutional rights were concerned and that so tainted the evidence that it is not admissible in the Court of law."
1979.78-1729,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3226.556,3235.818,"Mr. Kleinman, you don't get any comfort out of Irvine against California back in 347."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3235.818,3236.05,I'm not sure --
1979.78-1729,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3236.05,3238.958,"One way or the other, you don't cite it, neither does the Solicitor General."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3238.958,3244.408,No.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3244.408,3267.015,"From your arguments, even if the exclusionary rule were modified as has been advocated from time to time to say that it should not apply to the cases where the constable blundered but only to cases of egregious calculated intentional violations that this would fall under the latter category."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3267.015,3267.733,Yes.
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.06,3312.128,"Suppose if one of the differences and that is that -- I don't know what happened to Mr. Wolstencroft but I presume he has a pretty clear remedy against the agents for damages, doesn't he, the victim of the illegal search."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3312.128,3318.119,I suggest that that's possible except however that he was in -- under indictment for some only of his own activities.
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3326.977,3336.306,"But in the normal case, the bank representative who was victimized by this kind of procedure and if it will -- all -- all the facts came out, he'd have a pretty good lawsuit, I would think."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3336.306,3336.695,I believe that's true.
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3336.695,3338.717,It's not constable wonder type situation.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3338.717,3340.839,"Well, I believe that's true, however, I would suggest to this present --"
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.839,3346.352,So there was a deterrent at least in our legal system that is not present in -- in the Russian legal system --
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3346.352,3346.504,Well --
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.504,3347.533,-- insofar as I know about it.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3347.533,3350.454,"With all due respect, Your Honor, there is such a provision."
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.44,3376.275,"But -- but the normal cases, a third party is not implicated in the crime."
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3381.76,3382.154,"No, nothing in connection --"
1979.78-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.154,3384.942,-- insofar as (Voice Overlap) or maybe he did something else that we don't know about.
1979.78-1729,1,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3384.942,3385.656,Right.
1979.78-1729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3432.999,3433.617,"No, it's not."
