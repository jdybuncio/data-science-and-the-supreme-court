1972.71-1585,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,692.855,694.308,"I understand, he did nothing else --"
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,694.308,697.307,"He was asked on cross-examination, what do have you done?"
1972.71-1585,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,697.307,697.761,That’s what I think.
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,697.761,717.789,"He said, he may have picked up some pieces of aluminum foil, aluminum being one of the ingredients after they have fallen to floor and put them into flask, but he said he did not provide any other resistance and he did not advise or instruct the man how to go about completing the reaction or in any other way not assist in the crystallization either."
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.416,750.301,"Are the instructions, they were actually given by the trial (Voice Overlap) on page 17?"

1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,842.657,843.561,Exactly.
1972.71-1585,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,845.148,849.974,"Before you go on with that, may I ask you a factual -- about a factual matter."

1972.71-1585,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,907.039,910.419,"But that was in the first batch, not in the second batch?"
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,910.419,913.534,"Well, it was all manufactured from the same ingredient."
1972.71-1585,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.138,957.377,But some of these was made from this one essential ingredient which the respondent had obtained on his own from some other source?

1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.376,1015.623,"As I understand the -- now, this respondent, Richard Russell was indicted under three counts only."

1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.256,1026.162,And that concededly those activities all had to do with the batch so-called --

1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1026.673,1030.54,-- that was manufactured from the chemical provided by Mr. Shapiro?
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1030.54,1031.121,That’s right.
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.121,1031.64,Right.
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1031.64,1032.74,"No, question about that."
1972.71-1585,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1046.691,1060.027,"Mr. Lacovara, did the respondent tender any instruction in the District Court on a factual issue of whether or not this phenyl-2-propanone was or was not available from sources other than the Government agent?"

1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1140.866,1142.025,Yes.
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.025,1145.752,"-- ends up by saying it does not give a label to it, in any event, we reversing the conviction."
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1145.752,1148.058,His two theories in a nutshell are these.
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1270.731,1279.793,"So, that one of these theories was -- the latter theory was a constitutional theory and the first theory was a non-constitutional theory?"
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1279.793,1280.417,Yes sir.
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.417,1289.917,"Because entrapment is nothing about entrapment so far either is Sorrells or Sherman, either the court opinion or the concurring opinion that that was based on the constitution."
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1289.917,1300.761,"That’s right, that -- I’d like to approach now for Sorrells and Sherman to say why under either of the views presented in those cases, the indictment in this case ought to be reinstated."
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1595.185,1611.356,"It’s a little hard to square the language in the Sorrells either the Court’s language or the concurring opinion's language with the facts in Sorrells that I frankly have never known until I read the American Civil Liberties Union brief, amicus brief in this case."
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1616.597,1621.881,"Well, there were some indications in the record that he was a rum runner, but the --"
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1621.881,1622.478,"Rum runner, yes."
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1622.478,1639.14,"All the Court held in Sorrells was that if you -- if the jury had credited the defense testimony which was that he didn’t deal in liquor and had a good reputation in the community, they might have entertained a reasonable doubt which is the current standard about whether he had to pre-disposition."
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1652.213,1658.256,Chief Justice Hughes talks about an industrious man -- innocent man who has no previews record of any kind of --
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1658.256,1662.047,I’ll have to leave to the Court of the analysis.
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.848,1665.227,He may have been industrialist?
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1665.227,1669.104,[Laughter Attempt] The --
1972.71-1585,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1669.104,1679.538,"Well, if the jury believes the defendant’s version of the facts in that case, that would be what Chief Justice Hughes was talking about, would it not?"
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1679.538,1683.997,"Yes, that’s exactly right, but the judge, the trial judge refused to let the jury consider that."
1972.71-1585,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.808,1691.634,So everything that Hughes said was purpose by the -- and if that was either (Voice Overlap)
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1691.634,1691.828,Right.
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1853.243,1878.463,"Mr. Lacovara, how much of a concession do you mean to be making in your brief on page 32 where you say that it maybe the Due Process preclude that criminal conviction for engaging in conduct that would not have been possible without the participation and assistance for the Government agent who supplied indispensable means to the commission of the crime, that could not have been obtained otherwise through the illegal transaction?"
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1878.463,1881.878,"That’s would I would call a minimal concession, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1585,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.748,1915.174,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1915.174,1915.647,"Well, yes sir."
1972.71-1585,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.728,1932.665,"Well, I suppose if a Government agent and his friend were together and a friend said, gee, if I had a gun, I like to -- I’d kill that man, agent had him a gun, said, here go ahead, that would be example of your concession, wouldn't it?"
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1932.665,1938.842,There are practical constraints on the occasions in which undercover agents become involved in schemes.
1972.71-1585,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.236,2009.014,"Plus in this case on the second occasion, he had got the materials some place else?"
1972.71-1585,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2009.014,2017.953,"Yes sir, the -- Patrick Connelly had apparently 600-gram jars of P2P."

1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2086.222,2088.899,In the majority or dissenting or concurring opinion?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2088.899,2094.768,"In the majority opinion, the majority opinion in Sorrells we’ve quoted in our brief."
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2130.537,2135.413,Would you suggest there’s nothing new in the Court of Appeals' approach to this problem here?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2135.413,2139.892,"I am not -- I am suggesting there is nothing new in the Court of Appeals, that is correct Your Honor."

1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2185.604,2187.763,The second --
1972.71-1585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.763,2197.535,Is the entrapment concept as applied by this Court applicable to state convictions?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2197.535,2202.329,"Sir no, no, but and all this -- most of the states to my knowledge all of the states (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-1585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.329,2202.521,Oh!
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2210.459,2211.502,That is correct.
1972.71-1585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.502,2215.876,"So, there is something new in the Ninth Circuit approach?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2221.392,2231.622,"Well, it would be no - not necessary you’re talking, - yes, in the future, it certainly would be yes, but not, you mean, not as far as opening as the Government says in its reply brief by opening up the gates (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-1585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.622,2232.371,"Well, no."
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2233.567,2239.564,"That is correct, that’s right, that’s right because what I'm saying here is the Government has going far further."
1972.71-1585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.564,2253.061,"But the entrapment defense, however, it’s been spoken about you know our past cases, has not been constitutionalized to the extent that it’s applicable to the state."
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2253.061,2270.207,"That is correct, but there is one suggestion of course in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's separate opinion in Sherman where he does suggest an equal protection argument where there is with treating classes of individual differently whether or not they have a predisposition."
1972.71-1585,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.08,2294.819,"And by the same token, Congress could repeal the entrapment defense or it could provide with respect to any particular criminal statute, there should be no entrapment defense allowed, in defense of charge under this statute, couldn’t it?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2294.819,2295.79,Yes it could.

1972.71-1585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.765,2309.154,"But it couldn’t do way with the defense as, whatever the defense is as proceed by the Ninth Circuit?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2309.154,2309.992,That is correct.
1972.71-1585,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.992,2312.195,To the extent that it depends upon Due Process?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2312.195,2313.439,"Yes, it could do."

1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2348.169,2351.154,"Well, what was in that extra bottle?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2351.154,2358.115,"There was no laboratory analysis of that extra bottle, first of all despite what the Government says, the record is clear about that."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.929,2374.056,I didn’t say so either.
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2375.74,2377.614,It was obtained somebody else.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.789,2380.98,"So, it was obtainable."
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2383.046,2385.271,"No, I misunderstood Your Honor."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.393,2403.07,"Well, is there anything the record to show that there was no way for them to obtain this except through a Government agent?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2403.07,2403.444,No.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.444,2404.721,Of course not.
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2404.721,2407.866,"What it shows is that the Government agents, the Government B and D --"
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.866,2410.371,Facilitated it.
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2410.371,2413.07,They had dried up the supply.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.07,2415.42,And they facilitated it.
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2423.196,2427.369,"Yes, that’s what McGrath held, that’s what McGrath held."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2427.369,2428.82,That would be guaranteed?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2428.82,2429.609,Certainly.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.125,2434.783,And the reason is you can obtain that paper any place else except from the Government?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2434.783,2434.902,Oh!
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.601,2449.082,"Easily, easily at this term and to be counterfeit bills unless they have the right papers?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2449.082,2457.666,"Well, from the point -- if you -- from that point of view, if you have the right waive of paper in that type of thing, the only way that come is from the Government."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2457.666,2469.317,"Well, is all that the Speed in this country that we read about outside to this record, is that all obtained from the Government?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2469.317,2470.459,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.459,2472.505,"So, it is obtainable, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2472.505,2473.655,Speed is yes.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.655,2476.639,"No, I mean this ingredient is obtainable?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2476.639,2482.029,"Well, propanone is not necessary for all types of manufacture of Speed Your Honor."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2485.792,2490.209,"Well, does the record show that this man had been manufacturing it before?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2490.209,2491.784,"No, and that is something --"
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2491.784,2495.899,Where did he get that Speed tablet that he gave Shapiro on the first trip?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2495.899,2499.127,He did not give it to Shapiro.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.127,2499.87,Who did he give it to?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2499.87,2505.064,"He didn’t -- Mr. Russell did not give it anybody, it was Patrick Connelly."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2518.733,2529.515,"There was Speed there in this room, and it was there before the Government furnished anything?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2529.515,2539.323,"Yes, but not -- but Richard Russell had -- the only thing Richard Russell had to do with that, I’ve suggested in my --"
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.323,2545.174,It is your position that Richard Russell wouldn’t gotten involved because agent hadn’t talked to?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2545.174,2558.258,It is my from an argument that there is no evidence that the crime for which he was convicted would have gone ahead without Shapiro giving the phenyl-2-propanone.
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2558.258,2563.88,"Well, the way you’ve described it, it look like quite of production line there with four, five or six people involved?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2563.88,2572.623,"Your Honor, this is the way, this is on Whidbey Island which is North of Seattle and was a home and these people are not particularly organizing people come and go."
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2575.0,2580.008,"No, I'm speaking of production line for the production of the Speed."
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2580.008,2580.134,Oh!
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2585.83,2587.626,Oh! Like a home-made stew?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2587.626,2588.451,"That’s right, sure."
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2588.451,2591.372,"Yes, but it’s a production line nevertheless?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2591.372,2591.743,Well --
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2591.743,2593.174,And did produce?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2593.174,2593.862,Yes it did.
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2593.862,2603.761,"Before the agent’s appearance, during the agent’s participation and at times after he had left?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2603.761,2608.085,That’s not to suggest that Richard Russell had anything to do with that.
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2608.135,2608.541,I see.
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2611.142,2611.787,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2640.37,2645.734,"Well, then what you’re doing in that if I'm going to suggest Mr. Brucker, you’re arguing the sufficiency of the evidence?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2645.734,2647.212,"Absolutely, I am yes."
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2648.047,2652.445,"That’s a different question from the legal question you’d agree, wouldn’t you?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2652.445,2658.754,"Well, that I have suggested three grounds in which this -- the Court of Appeals could be affirmed."
1972.71-1585,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2841.179,2850.613,"Isn’t that true though with lots of chemical formulas that may have four or five ingredients that absent anyone of them, you wouldn’t get the end product?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2850.613,2856.956,"Not from the state -- that may will be, but I don’t think that that is true in this case just from the testimony of the chemist."
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2870.653,2883.269,"Well, suppose it was black carbonated soda that they needed to complete this process and they didn’t have any in the house that day and the stores were closed and the agents had supplied one for them."
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2890.189,2892.047,I find that as a different case Your Honor.
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2892.047,2896.352,Different case factually from this?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2896.352,2896.694,Yes it is.
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2896.694,2902.134,This substance was obtainable from other sources as Justice Marshall has pointed out --
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2902.134,2906.16,But it was -- the Government at least concedes it was difficult to obtain.
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2906.999,2916.568,"When the stores are closed, it’s difficult to get that black carbonated soda unless you some borrow some from the neighbor?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2916.568,2940.388,"That maybe, although I just -- to me, there’s a vast distinction between something which is available in every drug store and a chemical which one -- you can only get by having a license in the first place and two, which agents of the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs have gone around to the drug supply houses and say, please, don’t sell it at all even to very one with a license."
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2953.629,2965.583,"In other words, when the man goes around to five or six places and can’t give any, then, his appetite is whetted, he is an extreme situation."
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2965.583,2974.221,"No, but the other point might also be true, Your Honor and that is if can't get it perhaps he wouldn’t even have completed the manufacturing at all."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2974.221,2981.249,"And of course it also follows that you wouldn’t want it for something else, would you?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2981.249,2982.572,No.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2982.572,2985.084,It only wanted to make an illegal drug?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,2985.084,2986.526,That’s correct.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2986.526,2988.94,And so the Government makes you difficult.
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3006.836,3023.225,"There is a difference because the Government is not in fact -- the agent is not in fact providing, but I don’t see meaningful distinction between that because what they have made it only then from one source."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3030.679,3036.498,"I think your position is that the Government makes it possible in anyway for them to get it, they can’t prosecute."
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3036.498,3037.957,"No, that’s not true Your Honor."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3045.787,3046.251,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3046.251,3056.111,Absolutely Your Honor because what they are doing in this case is to provide something that without which for all the record shows.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3056.111,3062.802,Did they promote this first batch before Shapiro got that?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3062.802,3064.37,"No, Your Honor, but what did Richard Russell --"
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3064.37,3066.699,Did the Government promote that?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3066.699,3067.084,No.
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3067.084,3068.404,Was that a crime?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3068.404,3070.524,Not for which Richard Russell is charged and which this --
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3070.524,3076.977,"Would somebody guilty of that crime whoever made that Speed, Russell or somebody?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3076.977,3079.006,"Somebody, yes I would agree with that."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3079.006,3080.631,"The Government did promote that, did it?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3080.631,3087.904,"No, but that’s not the charge for which Richard Russell is here before this Court and when he was convicted out."
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3087.904,3092.086,Did the Government persuaded Russell to go in Speed business?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3092.086,3093.354,"For all, Your Honor?"
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3093.354,3096.293,For all intents and purposes that’s your position?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3096.293,3099.321,"Yes, because there is no evidence --"
1972.71-1585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3099.321,3101.651,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3101.651,3105.956,"Your Honor, Richard Russell had never been convicted of any crime before."
1972.71-1585,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3173.493,3176.187,You said it’s a factual error in the Government’s brief?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3176.187,3203.57,"Yes, it is Your Honor and Mr. Lacovara spoke actively this morning on page 4 of the reply brief in the second paragraph about 10 lines from the bottom talk about that he meaning Richard Russell, but obviously was one of the Connelly brothers and Mr. Lacovara so argued this morning."
1972.71-1585,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.57,3213.843,"As I recall Mr. Lacovara’s argument, he referred to some exchange where Richard Russell said, “After I get my half.”"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3213.843,3225.121,"Yes, that was after the -- that was under 10th of December 1969, that was after Shapiro had provided the chemical and the drug was produced."
1972.71-1585,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3225.121,3230.343,"Well, in the light of that, do you still say there’s nothing in the record that shows he was anything other than a law abiding citizen?"
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3230.343,3230.55,Oh!
1972.71-1585,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3232.403,3233.383,You’re talking about his prior record?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3233.383,3234.962,"Prior record, oh, absolutely."
1972.71-1585,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3234.962,3236.16,Contrasted with Sorrells?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3236.16,3236.391,Oh!
1972.71-1585,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3404.646,3411.946,These decisions been based on constitutional foundation?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3411.946,3418.657,"No, they have not Your Honor, but they have -- except this case."
1972.71-1585,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3418.657,3422.26,This case to extent it was (Voice Overlap) with the exception of this case have the others?
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3422.26,3443.765,"No, but what I'm saying is that the courts below have tortured their reasoning, tortured their opinions because they are outraged by what the Government does, but can’t find a handle on which to articulate what the basis is, what law they’re talking about is to why its bad."
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3564.415,3565.803,Thank you Mr. Brucker.
1972.71-1585,1,42434,thomas_h_s_brucker,,3574.674,3575.334,Thank you.
1972.71-1585,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.334,3576.182,Thank you gentlemen.
