2008.08-289,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-289, Horne v. Flores and the consolidated case."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,7.354,25.715,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In January of 2000 the district court in Arizona concluded that the Nogales school system had failed to provide an equal educational opportunity for its English language learners in that particular district."
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,25.715,37.506,I -- I thought the determination was that it had failed to provide funds that could reasonably accomplish the -- the -- the plan which the district itself had adopted.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,37.506,45.529,"Well, Your Honor, the specific finding was that there needed to be -- there were very elaborate findings here."
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,52.599,54.718,"But the district agreed on that, I take it."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,73.546,74.298,--You are correct.
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,74.298,74.781,Okay.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,74.781,75.814,It needs to be a rational plan.
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.4,110.321,"What was the year, Mr. Starr, the year of that change to the SEI from the bilingual education?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,111.204,124.481,"--The voters voted it in, in November of 2000, and it began feathering in very promptly as soon as the school districts could in fact respond, and Nogales--"
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.481,140.241,"And yet the district court kept renewing his instruction, provide funding that reasonably relates to the cost, many, many times after the SEI became effective."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,151.731,153.583,--That is true.
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,199.329,200.545,Nogales was doing great?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,247.962,253.33,"--Your Honor, first of all, the exam to which you are referring is given in English."
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,258.234,261.02,"Well, isn't the point of this to teach the children to learn English?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,261.02,266.839,--But the point is the -- the exam that you should look at is the AZELA exam.
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.839,267.356,Excuse me.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,280.516,283.885,Here is -- and I think we can cut to -- I'm sorry.
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.885,287.17,"If you can't answer that, I think Justice Breyer can."
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,289.539,291.705,He doesn't actually have the right to ask me questions.
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.491,292.924,--I don't.
2008.08-289,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,294.907,296.026,Very much true.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,297.543,298.478,Thank you.
2008.08-289,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,351.945,357.933,"Well, I still don't have an answer to Justice Breyer's -- I guess Justice Scalia's question following up on Justice Breyer's."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,363.67,364.27,Yes.
2008.08-289,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,400.593,406.664,So the answer is that Justice Breyer's figures are correct with respect to the appropriate bases of children.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,410.734,416.472,"--Well, again, my quarrel with his figures had to do with the nature of the test being exam."
2008.08-289,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,418.072,418.472,Right.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,420.507,425.411,That one shouldn't take too seriously a test that is--
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,425.411,425.861,All right.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,492.603,498.674,"--But not home yet, Your Honor, is, in fact, the key question."
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,500.69,501.626,Let's do another one.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,540.667,543.203,"--No, that is incorrect, Your Honor."
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.046,597.503,"Mr. Starr, can I take you back to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you seem to have shifted ground?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,643.882,652.638,"It is not detached, but our submission is, in fact, that we look to what the district court had before it in the 60(b)(5) hearing."
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.16,666.981,"But that was the basis for the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate funding."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,666.981,674.837,"--Your Honor, there were a variety of points made, and the 60(b) submission was not limited to this new bill."
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,698.369,707.391,Do we -- do we have the -- the intervention application in the papers before us and the 60(b) motion?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,707.391,710.593,"--Yes, you do -- you do have it before you."
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,748.968,750.418,"Well, I -- help me out then."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,817.862,819.481,As -- that is correct.
2008.08-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.974,870.545,"Mr. Starr, how do you explain the fact the State of Arizona and the board of education are troubled by the same two points?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,870.545,875.782,There is no question that there is disagreement within the house with respect to that.
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,887.272,891.808,"Well, what is it -- No Child Left Behind I thought has a specific saving clause,"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,903.432,904.634,--That is correct.
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,935.003,937.522,What is the one State funding?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,952.449,953.015,--Yes.
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,953.015,957.703,"--maintenance and operation budget, by 30 percent."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1008.201,1013.32,"The numbers are not wrong, Your Honor, but the numbers are in fact not the pivotal point."
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1040.554,1056.765,"That was the fault of the Arizona attorney general, who told the court: You cannot deal with Nogales alone because under the Arizona Constitution the -- all -- all the school districts have to be treated equally."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1066.038,1071.942,"And we are now seeking relief from that, because what we now know--"
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1071.942,1074.644,"Well, it should -- has the state law changed?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1074.644,1075.71,--What has changed--
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1075.71,1079.714,"I mean, the reason -- the reason for getting into this is that the State required it."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1080.848,1086.835,"--The State law does not require specific earmarked funding, district by district, and here's the key--"
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.835,1087.685,--I assume it's--
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1087.685,1089.954,"No, we are not talking about -- I'm sorry."
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.954,1100.493,--I also assume the State law does not require that any -- any judicial decree with respect to a particular district be expanded to the whole State.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1123.591,1125.543,--It's why the district court should have been on guard--
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1125.543,1127.627,What is the district court supposed to do?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1142.969,1145.421,"--Your Honor, we are not trying to relitigate the original judgment."
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.788,1149.873,"The fact is he wanted to be thrown into the briar patch, didn't he?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1149.873,1150.756,--It was--
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.756,1153.192,The State attorney general wanted the decree.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1153.192,1162.298,--There is -- there is no question that there was a division of the opinion within the State and that in fact the attorney general was essentially siding with the plaintiffs in their litigation.
2008.08-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1174.022,1187.663,Could you tell me what your submission is with respect to the error you see in the findings and the order made after the eight-day hearing?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1203.756,1210.093,"--No, it's not less onerous, but there is a different methodology and a different approach."
2008.08-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1210.093,1210.56,All right.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1218.516,1226.853,A funding remedy is in fact inappropriate presumptively statewide.
2008.08-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1231.638,1236.959,"If we could -- is it valid as to Nogales, if we focus just on Nogales?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1236.959,1241.862,"Not in terms of changed circumstances, because of what has in fact happened on the ground."
2008.08-289,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1245.064,1246.047,You lost me.
2008.08-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1246.047,1251.568,Are you saying -- are you saying that the order the district court gave with respect just to Nogales--
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1251.568,1252.001,--Yes.
2008.08-289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1252.001,1259.99,"--is inappropriate because it used a funding remedy or a funding measure of compliance when it should have used blank, and then fill in the blank?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1259.99,1260.424,Yes.
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1272.482,1276.334,But that isn't what it -- I don't understand that it has ever said that.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1315.292,1315.827,--And--
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1315.827,1316.877,Am I -- am I wrong?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1318.363,1321.315,--It did go beyond that in this sense.
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1330.254,1339.109,"In other words, it should have said: Before I decide whether your funding for plan A is good enough, I have got to decide whether plan A itself is worth anything?"
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1340.559,1341.309,--No.
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1350.298,1350.834,All right.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1372.931,1377.485,--The district court failed to note that plan A had changed.
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.388,1393.542,"But that came in in 2000 and this case was going on for, what, eight, nine years before there was ever an argument."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1404.6,1406.468,--Of -- of course.
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.391,1424.929,"Yes, but didn't -- didn't the court -- you say plan A is no longer in effect; they have a new plan under the No Child Left Behind Act."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1433.702,1445.443,"--Well, it said that -- here is what the court held: That it has developed a significantly improved infrastructure for ELL programming, but it has not complied with the original judgment."
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1474.16,1480.831,"I didn't think there was in the district judge's declaratory judgment, spend this much on teachers aides, that much on the other."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1504.097,1518.856,"You are precisely right, but the point I'm making is that the objects of that underlying decree shifted by virtue of the new methodology that was in fact adequately funded through a whole variety of funds."
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1524.693,1525.21,No.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1546.542,1547.758,We believe not.
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1553.296,1555.731,But those are the issues that the court focused on; are they not?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1555.731,1565.337,"Wrongly, because that's -- that's part of our quarrel, that the district court simply focused on these two elements of HB 2064, and blinded itself to the evidence--"
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1565.337,1572.407,There is a minor thing that I -- I think -- I'm not sure that Justice Ginsburg said.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1589.368,1591.102,"--That is correct, and that is--"
2008.08-289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1591.102,1591.585,All right.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1614.714,1615.783,--Three brief points.
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.133,1668.35,"Well, I -- I agree with that."
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1679.023,1680.29,But we should be able now to--
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.29,1682.225,But that's -- that's water over the dam.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1684.059,1689.963,"--No, Your Honor, not under 60(b), and this Court has warned about the ability of State officials--"
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.963,1694.617,What has 60(b) got to do with the question of whether the attorney general represents the State before the court?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1710.56,1712.428,--Not under Arizona law.
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1715.863,1721.517,So the district court is supposed to referee a fight between the governor and the attorney general at this point?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1721.767,1722.317,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.08-289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1730.539,1732.306,Doesn't the attorney general speak for the State?
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1732.306,1734.908,"--No, Your Honor, not in Arizona."
2008.08-289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1740.645,1751.619,"But he was speaking alone for years and years, and 60(b) -- and it has been said over and over again -- is not a substitute for appeal."
2008.08-289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.26,1766.343,Which would be good enough to fix Nogales.
2008.08-289,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1778.768,1782.636,And former officials shouldn't continue to be able to bind the State.
2008.08-289,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1784.12,1784.838,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1790.373,1800.431,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the district court issued its initial judgment in 2000, what the court found was that there was a systemic violation of the EEOA."
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.37,1821.845,Can I ask whether the requirements of the EEOA are at all affected by Congress's later enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act?
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1847.995,1854.649,"Justice Scalia, just one point of clarification on -- in our view on what the EEOA requires, and then I will address the No Child Left Behind point."
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.053,1862.636,Okay.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1864.605,1866.123,"With that -- With that clarification, thank you."
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.123,1866.657,That's fine.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1866.657,1877.514,"With that clarification on the question of whether No Child Left Behind sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA, which is, I think, what the petitioners' position is, we think the answer is no for two fundamental reasons."
2008.08-289,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1885.684,1887.886,"I don't think that's their argument, counsel."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1905.082,1917.155,"I think their argument at the end of the day, Justice Alito, is that if you comply with No Child Left Behind -- and I will get to in a moment what compliance with No Child Left Behind can mean -- then you have necessarily complied with the EEOA."
2008.08-289,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1927.261,1930.113,"Can I ask you this question about the Ninth Circuit's decision, which is what we are reviewing?"
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1971.774,1975.576,"Well, I -- I don't know that that is a correct interpretation of the EEOA."
2008.08-289,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1988.069,1990.186,"No, but isn't -- that isn't really my question."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2006.113,2011.601,"--The Ninth Circuit focused on funding, Justice Alito, because that is the way the case has been litigated from the outset."

2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2032.68,2039.418,"--Well, I think the Ninth Circuit was -- was required certainly to review the district court's inquiry into that."
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2082.161,2092.017,"But I guess, as I understand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order is based on funding a particular plan and the State comes back and says, this is a new approach."

2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2107.896,2108.679,What's wrong with that?
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2108.679,2111.515,"--There is nothing wrong with that, and it should be looked at."
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2123.838,2126.857,It's not a question of progress; it's a question of the plan and the approach.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2167.367,2169.469,"--Well, the district court didn't issue that sort of order."

2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2200.322,2201.455,--It's at 66a.
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2214.696,2218.534,"--Well, I don't think the State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree that there's still work to be done."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2235.544,2250.903,"Well, there's two fundamentally different assertions being made by Petitioners, if I understand it: One is what Justice Scalia alluded to earlier, which is that No Child Left Behind changed the legal landscape in a way such that compliance with No Child Left Behind, such as it is, sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA."
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.178,2287.778,What degree--
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2287.778,2288.278,--doubted that.
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.278,2290.13,--What degree of improvement do you think is necessary?

2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.209,2341.996,"--doesn't meet the -- a majority of ELL tenth graders fail to meet the standards, but the majority of native English speakers do."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2341.996,2360.726,"--Well, that's part of what it says, and I think what the Ninth Circuit is also alluding to with respect to the high school in particular that, if you look at State survey that Petitioners rely on in -- in touting the improvements in certain schools, it also with respect to the high school shows that the two high schools in Nogales was ranked -- were ranked at the very bottom of the survey for ELL students."

2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2387.46,2395.983,--I -- I think we would agree because that sets the charter for provision of programs to ELL students going forward from its enactment.
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2439.327,2439.929,Is there any--
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2439.929,2440.695,--of this new funding recipe.
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.695,2446.764,--Does -- then does that stay true without regard to what is happening economically to the State?

2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.12,2496.579,--I find it bizarre that we are sitting here talking about what the whole State has to do on the basis of one district which is concededly the district that has the most nonnative English speakers and has been a problem district all along.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2504.868,2505.518,Well--
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.518,2524.098,"And the mere fact that the State Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind of a system at the outset, does that force us to still accept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for Nogales is also necessary for the entire State?"
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2524.098,2538.156,"--Justice Scalia, I think that that issue becomes largely an academic one for the following reason: that the reason that the State Attorney General made the acknowledgment that he did is that, under the Arizona State Constitution, funding decisions don't vary from district to district."
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.56,2546.16,I'll let--

2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2564.022,2572.96,"--Well, it could be, but I don't think there's really much of a dispute that the statewide funding measure doesn't really affect what the State's going to do in this case, because--"
2008.08-289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2572.96,2580.149,"Well, it seems to me very odd that -- assume you have a constitutional provision which says funding must be equal in each district."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2604.099,2605.315,"--No, absolutely not."
2008.08-289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2607.05,2612.62,"But -- yes, but that seems to me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the answer you gave Justice Scalia."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2612.62,2615.006,"I don't think it's a necessary conclusion of my argument, Justice Kennedy."
2008.08-289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2625.912,2636.42,"But, again, what you're -- you're saying that any time a district court in a single district orders more money to remedy a constitutional problem, that because of that clause it has to apply to every other district."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2637.303,2638.07,"--Well, if the--"
2008.08-289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2638.07,2643.807,"And if -- and if it is, then that is a very good reason for the district court to cede its jurisdiction to the State authorities."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2643.807,2659.785,"--Well, if the litigation had come up in a different way, Justice Kennedy, such that it had always focused exclusively on what happened in Nogales, including the funding aspect of the case, but I think what would have been appropriate is that the district court would have inquired about what funding resources belong to Nogales in particular."
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2682.099,2692.156,"But I gather it's often the case in institutional litigation of this sort that the political figures, whether it's the Governor or the Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look, we should spend more money on this."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2716.605,2724.294,"--Well, two points, Mr. Chief Justice, and first -- and I don't mean to quibble, but the Attorney General did contest the litigation at the outset."
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2730.447,2739.47,"Well, it's hard for the Attorney General to get funding from the legislature for all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get it, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't have a choice."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2739.47,2755.313,"--Well, sure, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what the Court did in both Rufo and Frew is it accommodated those concerns, and it accommodated the interest in finality that comes from judgments, and the interests in allowing a different set of State officials to suggest new programs to make that suggestion to the district court."
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2762.134,2764.419,Can I ask just a question that was confusing to me?
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2769.239,2771.874,--The one that was outlined by this Court in Rufo.
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2771.874,2772.608,Which is?
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2772.608,2775.31,A significant change of facts or a significant change of law.
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2775.76,2782.397,"I am looking at page 72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they use there is radically changed, not significantly changed."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2782.397,2787.801,"--Well, on page 49a they invoke the precise wording of this Court, cite Rufo for that proposition, and also--"
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2787.801,2797.64,"So, if we have a -- if we are confused as to which standard they applied, because at one point they say significantly changed and at another point they say radically changed, what should we do?"
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2797.64,2804.294,"--Well, I -- I would give effect to the articulation of the standard in the standard review question section of the opinion."
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.114,2887.714,Right but--
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2887.714,2890.066,--simply because the State will have had an approved plan.
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.066,2890.583,--I understand that.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2908.644,2910.313,I -- I don't think so.
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.829,2914.281,"Well, then -- then it's not as simple as you made it."
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2937.881,2942.617,--The -- the No Child Left Behind Act doesn't -- it doesn't approve a particular program.
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.736,2947.869,It doesn't approve programs?
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2947.869,2948.438,--No--
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2948.438,2950.704,I thought the States had to submit a program.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2950.704,2959.16,--What the EEOA concerns are programs that are reasonably calculated to achieve overcoming language barriers.
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.16,2959.56,Right.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2959.56,2967.15,"What No Child Left Behind concerns is, is there a testing program in place that calls for certain improvements in testing over time."
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.576,2983.209,So you are saying you can't calculate costs.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2983.209,2984.125,--Right.
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.125,2987.661,You cannot calculate costs under the plan approved by the Secretary--
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2987.661,2988.444,I--
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.444,2990.113,--because all the plan is is testing.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2990.113,2990.729,--Right.
2008.08-289,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.763,2992.315,Okay.
2008.08-289,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2992.315,2995.35,"And even if you don't make the progress -- and if I could finish this one point, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-289,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3011.274,3011.86,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3026.702,3033.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's important to recognize what Petitioners asked for here at the rule 60(b)(5) stage."
2008.08-289,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3053.818,3061.857,But couldn't the district court give them the relief to which they were entitled even if it was less than what they sought?
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3061.857,3063.257,Certainly.
2008.08-289,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3110.052,3115.69,"Counsel, when you were starting out I heard you articulate a third standard, materially changed."
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3123.046,3128.097,"I understand it to be significant change, which, I don't see significant and material as being all that different."
2008.08-289,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3128.849,3132.067,"Well, I don't either but I see both of them being different from radically changed."
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3132.067,3143.209,"--Again, I think if you look at the Ninth Circuit's opinion, particularly where it starts out with the standard of review, it cites this Court's precedents in Rufo and Agostini; it talks about the need for significant changed circumstances."
2008.08-289,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3160.921,3177.18,Did the district court on the 8-day hearing on remand make a finding that its incremental funding determinations that it had made earlier were an accurate way to measure compliance and to insist on compliance under the new immersion program?
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3177.18,3185.452,"--If I understand your question correctly, and please correct me if I don't, but the district court considered two different arguments."
2008.08-289,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3213.805,3222.209,Why does it matter that there is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL programs exclusively?
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3229.665,3238.419,"--I think the reason the district court was focused on that because that was always the State's position that, in terms of the statewide scheme, that that is how they were going to fund ELL education."
2008.08-289,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3248.877,3265.171,"Well, that may have been their -- that may have been their position originally, but at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference does it make whether the money came from funds that were designated for ELL program, or from general State funds, or from county funds?"
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3288.703,3294.94,"--Well, the district court could have found that the plan had changed and that funding could come from -- from different places."
2008.08-289,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3348.492,3357.348,"But the fact that you keep talking about the district court emphasizes my concern about the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which is what we are reviewing."
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3369.672,3372.873,"With respect, I don't think that that was their exclusive focus."
2008.08-289,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3378.241,3379.11,"Well, they say."
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3403.809,3404.359,--That's right.
2008.08-289,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3441.165,3445.969,I still have trouble with the idea of district courts ordering State legislatures to fund it.
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3471.667,3475.786,And I think the district court was appropriately differential to the State throughout this litigation.
2008.08-289,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3517.613,3532.623,"Why does it order then -- why did its order specify and be linked to the termination of the legislative session, and say you have 12 days left in the session and that's how many days you have to enact this budget?"
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3532.623,3545.548,"--I think it's because the State kept coming back to the district court and saying that the legislature had asked for this cost study, there was an interim bill, House Bill 2010, where the legislature said we put in place another study that we are going to perform."
2008.08-289,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3601.719,3609.373,"But the district -- the district judge said that that 2064 did not have enough, it raised it to 450 or whatever."
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3630.536,3631.821,--Could I answer that?
2008.08-289,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3650.933,3654.085,"Ms. Saharsky, I have one late arriving question."
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3688.908,3690.36,"No, as I understand it--"
2008.08-289,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3690.36,3690.81,I doubt it.
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3690.81,3691.71,--when it's talking about a uniform--
2008.08-289,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3691.71,3692.41,Yeah.
2008.08-289,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3692.41,3696.431,"--and equal amount, it's talking about the amount that the State gives to the school districts."
2008.08-289,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3699.799,3708.838,"Well, if federal funding doesn't count, why would a federal decree applicable only to a particular school district count?"
