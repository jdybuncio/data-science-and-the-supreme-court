1976.75-1221,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.486,"We’ll hear arguments first this morning in number 75-1221, United States against Consumer Life Insurance Company and the two other cases consolidated with that case."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,19.005,21.997,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1221,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,179.065,182.611,That’s simply a matter of statutory definition of what is a life company.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,182.611,183.701,Exactly.
1976.75-1221,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.701,193.906,"And it’s a -- basically a life insurance company is an insurance company that more -- that does more than its half, more than half of whose business is life insurance measured by its reserves."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,193.906,194.848,That’s correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-1221,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,194.848,196.394,Is that it?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,196.394,207.337,"Now the question in this case, in these cases that is, focuses on the quantity of the denominator in fraction that is total reserves."
1976.75-1221,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,374.19,375.609,There is -- may I interrupt you.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,379.949,382.093,No Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-1221,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,392.437,395.458,"There is also a term accident and health insurance, single premium, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,395.458,397.268,Exactly; that’s what is involved here.
1976.75-1221,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.298,708.91,The way that you described that the initial or sometimes you referred to as the direct insurer is essentially like a general agent in the field who receives the commission for initiating the business whereas the risk taking is by the reinsure.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,708.91,747.046,"Essentially that’s our submission Mr. Chief Justice that for purposes of Treaty I the independent that insurer was really nothing more than a commission agent, because when the smoke clear it was all -- it only held its 9.5% of premiums everything -- it paid the claims out of this fund that was about to drop down and was -- and essentially that the taxpayers agreed by contract to assume the risk and everything that was left over, less its commission, was paid over back to the taxpayer -- to these taxpayer insurance companies."
1976.75-1221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.046,752.11,"Mr. Smith, I think you argued Foster Lumber here --"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,752.11,752.23,That’s correct.
1976.75-1221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.23,770.995,"-- a few weeks ago, don’t you, and you prevailed by a narrowly divided vote over a strong dissent, and it struck there that the Government’s position was that we read the statute as written and don’t make any allowance for equities or substance or that sort of thing."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,782.928,792.727,I don’t think so Mr. Justice Rehnquist and the reason I don’t think so is because I think that the statutory term as I will develop at greater length in a few minutes.
1976.75-1221,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,839.961,845.376,"Well, you have to take that position in view of your position in Foster Lumber."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,845.376,847.355,"Well, we try to be consistent Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1976.75-1221,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,847.355,854.508,"Well, the Internal Revenue Service has quite self inconsistency in their past."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,858.233,858.667,We try to --
1976.75-1221,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,858.667,861.825,I am not critical; the case is a case.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,861.825,866.977,Surely would be -- we would be consistent within a single term of this Court. [Laughter]
1976.75-1221,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,866.977,869.398,But you do consistently try to collect taxes.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,869.398,871.157,Absolutely. [Laughter Attempt]
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.157,875.084,Mr. Smith just to follow up on what Justice Rehnquist said.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,880.639,881.523,That is correct.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.523,886.802,Where is the -- and you acknowledge the unearned premiums are in a different place than the unearned premium reserve.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,886.802,889.078,The unearned premium dollars are in the different place.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.078,890.838,But you say unearned premiums doesn’t mean --
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,890.838,896.917,I think that -- I think as we point out in our brief and I’ll be happy to go into at a greater length during my argument.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.962,929.6,"The Congress omitted a word, it’s perfectly clear and intended to include where concern --"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,929.6,932.29,"I think that so, I think the structure, as I will point out --"
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.29,936.126,"So, you are, to a certain extent, asking as to change the language of the statute?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,936.126,943.706,"Well no, I am not asking to change language of the statute; I am asking you to be construed and consistent with what I think is the appropriate way."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,943.706,945.949,Sort of an equitable way?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,945.949,950.394,Well no and I think that the correct -- right.[Laughter]
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.838,965.786,"Mr. Smith, let me just cover one another thing with you before you get into Treaty II."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,982.93,988.003,"Well, they were -- they had the status of a direct insurer in that sense."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.077,990.33,But did they not have that?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,990.33,996.098,"But they were not involved -- but they were not -- I think for state purposes, you know, they were a direct insurer."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.701,1009.195,"But did they not, by qualifying as an insurance company, provide something that the transaction which a general agent or a bookkeeper or a client could not --"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1009.195,1010.316,I think that -- I think that’s right.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1010.469,1012.791,And if that were not true they wouldn’t have been in the picture at all.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1012.791,1014.623,I think that’s right.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.827,1067.602,"Mr. Smith is that quite fair because, didn’t state law have -- isn’t the purpose of the state law to be sure that a company of a certain capital structure is able to assume the risks that all the policy of holders rely on when they take out there insurance."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1074.139,1084.672,"It was performing; I suppose it was performing a function under state law because in this particular case, for example, in Consumer Life, Georgia had minimum capitalization requirements with Consumer Life --"
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.672,1092.975,And the purpose of a minimum capitalization -- the purpose of those requirements is to be sure there is a company there with efficient substance to assume these risks.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1092.975,1094.228,That’s right.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.351,1123.769,Before the risk in a way which would not have satisfied state law requirements without this other company in the picture.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1123.769,1135.358,"That’s right, because the state law requirements of Georgia would insist that a company issuing insurance in Georgia have a minimum capitalization and that was the direct insurer."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.115,1146.54,But the only purpose of my questioning was to test the importance of your point that they are nothing more than a bookkeeper.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1150.629,1153.152,I think that’s probably -- I think that’s right.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.232,1275.629,"Mr. Smith, let me just interject you, because I want to be sure you cover it."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1280.851,1281.61,Yes.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.61,1287.084,In Treaty II what is your conception of the contribution to the total arrangement which the independent company made?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1287.084,1288.554,It’s also a bookkeeping function.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.554,1290.644,"But why did they need them at all, if you are correct. that there really is a --"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1290.644,1293.173,"Oh, well they need it -- why did they need them at all."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.351,1307.606,Then if there were no reinsurance arrangement at all?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1316.699,1317.829,Well they could.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.615,1324.132,You must have a theory as to why they didn’t.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1324.132,1347.712,"Well, the theory has to be essentially that they did this in order to qualify as a life insurance company, because if they issued this A&H insurance directly, then the -- there would be no question, nobody would be here arguing that the reserves were not attributable to these taxpayers, and they would flunk the 50% test."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.4,1361.241,"Now, that would explain why they would reinsure the A&H, but why would they reinsure the Life?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1361.241,1361.939,They didn’t.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.939,1362.571,They did not reinsure the Life at all?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1362.571,1364.369,"They did not, no."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.369,1366.087,So the whole purpose of it is to qualify.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1366.087,1366.496,Right!
1976.75-1221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1384.033,1388.975,One legitimate purpose at any business is the avoidance of taxes.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1388.975,1405.362,"Absolutely Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would not quarrel with that proposition, but I think that a transaction has to have some independent substance, and here, where you have a situation where these premiums are just being held back and paid on a monthly dribble."
1976.75-1221,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1571.411,1581.148,What would be your view Mr. Smith on a contract of risk sharing where hypothetically half of the risk was reinsured?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1581.148,1586.704,"Well then, I suppose there would be, you know, half of the reserves would be allocable to one and half to the other."
1976.75-1221,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.086,1599.291,"But then the initial insurer, concerning which I inquired before, would be something more than a general agent, wouldn’t he?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1599.291,1608.97,"That’s correct, and to the extent that they bare the risk, the reserves corresponding to that risk ought to be included in their total reserves."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1625.261,1628.638,Did you say that the reinsuring company would pay the claim?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1631.811,1639.257,"Under type two, the way it seems to have worked although the record is not entirely clear that the independent company paid the claim."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1639.257,1641.583,By independent do you mean the company that issued the policy?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1641.583,1649.952,"Yes, but no that’s the range in Treaty II, in the Treaty II arrangement, the independent company is the purported reinsurer."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1670.731,1674.967,Taxpayer is the company that qualifies as a life -- as an insurance company?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1674.967,1680.438,"Right, these taxpayers here whose qualification is at issue, it would issue the insurance policy --"
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1680.438,1681.085,Right.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1681.085,1695.312,"-- and then it would pay out the premiums on a quarterly basis but take back a tentative 50% commission, and then the independent company would pay out all the claims out of the remainder."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1695.312,1698.155,You put me off a bit when you say independent.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1702.715,1712.339,"Well, we could Mr. Justice Powell but my only hesitance to adopt that nomenclatures that we don’t think that the Treaty II arrangement was reinsurance."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1712.339,1712.496,But you are not --
1976.75-1221,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1712.496,1713.909,Speak in terms of the taxpayers and the --
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1713.909,1715.54,Okay.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1718.397,1720.245,"Well, what is the other company, the reinsurer?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1720.245,1722.086,The other company is called the reinsurer.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1722.086,1724.228,"Well, we are not going to decide the case on the basis --"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1724.228,1725.427,Okay.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1725.427,1726.494,-- of your nomenclature.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1726.494,1727.116,Exactly.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1729.705,1729.995,Right.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1734.806,1741.735,"It’s reimbursed out of -- whether essentially is it’s reimbursed out of the claim, out the reimbursed it itself."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1776.879,1780.065,"So in that situation, the reimbursement would be delayed?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1780.065,1782.04,Yes.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1791.346,1794.281,In the event of that delay would interest be paid?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1794.281,1795.208,I don’t know.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1803.342,1806.25,"Well, you regard the whole thing as a sham as your brief states."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1806.25,1807.054,I think that’s right.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1809.091,1819.345,"Right, but is it also a sham were there is no parent subsidiary relationship and this is a contract of reinsurance negotiated at arms length?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1819.345,1851.161,"Well, when I use the word sham one tends to think that you know that it’s no substance and that is sort of a tax avoidance motive, which I think is the case here, but I don’t think it would matter whether it was negotiated at arms length, because when you examine the figures and what, you know, this elaborate arrangement, which is called reinsurance but actually when you strip away all the technical, you know, all the contract provisions, you know, I think for tax purposes this was not reinsurance."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1851.161,1852.279,But may I ask this question?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1852.279,1852.377,Sure.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1852.377,1863.484,"If it is a sham, what would be the business reason for an independent reinsurer to enter into a sham arrangement as to be nice?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1863.484,1866.256,Earn a 3% commission.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1926.101,1928.213,But the state agency do recognize the agreement?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1928.213,1937.744,The state agency recognized it but the state -- we don’t think that really matters for purposes of Section 801 (c) (2) as I think we pointed out in our reply brief.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.949,1964.555,But on that very point Mr. Smith.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1973.425,1973.62,Yes that is --
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1973.62,1975.707,-- you say as the practical matter its unlikely to happen.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1979.397,1982.091,That is correct and that is the only case that --
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.091,1984.423,"Well, isn’t there a second case."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1995.781,1997.018,That is also correct.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.018,2001.42,"So there are two risks that the reinsurer assumes that are both rarely unlikely, but yet our risk --"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2001.42,2006.324,Right and I think that the case has to be examined in terms of what is likely.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.661,2022.521,If we look at likelihoods and probabilities rather than the literal language of the contracts in the statute?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2022.521,2023.101,Yes.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2065.137,2067.92,It’s a -- a reserve is a liability.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2071.449,2072.21,I don’t think so.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.21,2073.59,Was this to be a liability to this case?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2073.59,2074.056,Right.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2153.754,2167.479,"In the case of health and accident insurance, do you also have a reserve for the unearned premium as distinguished from the reserve representing the risk on premium?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2167.479,2177.419,"Well, Mr. Justice Powell in the health and accident insurance, there is no accepted table the way there is in life insurance to sort measure the risk."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2187.685,2189.562,Is that they way it’s recorded on the books?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2189.562,2197.918,"That’s the way it would be recorded on the books, but that doesn’t mean as I think we’ve point that in our brief in greater detail, that the unearned premium dollars are the reserve."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2202.881,2216.933,"To take your $120.00 example, you started putting a $120.00 if you had the entire right to the premium on the reserve side of your balance sheet as a liability."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2216.933,2217.551,Yes.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2217.551,2219.054,Would you?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2219.054,2223.71,"It would be put -- it’s not really a balance sheet asset like a liability, but it would go in summary of operations, but yes."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2223.71,2229.062,"Well, a reserve is on the liability side of a balance sheet."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2229.062,2230.097,"Yes, that’s right."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2230.097,2235.999,At the end of the first month that reserve would be reduced by 1/12?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2235.999,2237.233,That’s right.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2237.233,2244.071,"Now, that would be taken into income at that point, the 1/12 of the premium?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2244.071,2247.066,"Well, it would be a sort of an unrestricted I suppose, you know, in that sense, yes."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2247.066,2248.854,"Yes, but it would be income?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2248.854,2249.44,Yes.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2249.44,2252.242,On which the taxpayer would pay a tax.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2261.573,2262.01,I don’t think so.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2268.841,2270.399,You put a claim --
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2270.399,2273.281,Its essentially has reduced liability.
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2273.281,2277.523,"What do you put on the asset side of the balance sheet at the beginning, a $120.00?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2277.523,2288.767,"At the beginning, I suppose it would be -- well, it would be put in as an asset of premiums received, I suppose and then --"
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2288.767,2291.856,And before it is collected?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2291.856,2294.819,"Well, let's put it -- oh I see your point."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2313.284,2314.608,"Well, carry on Mr. Smith."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2321.31,2322.392,Yes.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.958,2367.748,"Before you sit down, excuse me."
1976.75-1221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.748,2382.789,Your asking us to make two changes in the statute that one we had the word reserve to the word premium and then we attribute the reserve to the insurer?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2382.789,2384.507,I don’t think you have to change in statute Mr. Justice.
1976.75-1221,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.507,2387.052,Well additions to the language that Congress --
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2387.052,2402.622,"Well, I think when you look at the structure of the statute it talks about -- there are three kinds of reserves. One, life insurance reserves; Two, unearned premiums and unpaid losses not included in life insurance reserves; And three, all other insurance reserves required by law."
1976.75-1221,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2455.402,2468.665,"Mr. Smith, I do want to ask one other question because under your theory the unearned premium reserve on the accident and health business remains with the taxpayer because it only takes the risk as you analyze it."
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2483.377,2484.794,It possibly could be.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.786,2492.13,"No, for federal tax purposes assuming that the reinsurer was also a company that was in the --"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2492.13,2493.945,Oh no.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2494.067,2495.816,It will never be included in the reinsurer's --
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2495.816,2498.412,The Commission of Internal Revenue would never put the reserve in both places.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.058,2504.824,Even if it was of difference between qualifying as a life company and for the reinsurer?
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2504.824,2512.725,"Oh, I think that we would -- our rule that the reserves follow the risk, we would obviously, possibly lose some cases under this rule."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.075,2528.512,"Well, but the fact that you say the risk is in the taxpayer does not necessarily negate the possibility that it’s also in the reinsurer?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2528.512,2534.801,"There maybe a slight risk as you pointed out from insolvency and so forth and so on but, you know that’s a negligible --"
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.801,2535.237,You wouldn’t think --
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2535.237,2538.115,We don’t require attribution of the reserve.
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2538.115,2541.07,What if the risk were just a little more probable in the other company.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2547.791,2556.994,"Well that might be you know, that could be sort or a -- there is a type of reinsurance known as excess loss reinsurance and which probably could be calculated."
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.558,2584.092,"So, the issue really turns on a kind of a finding of fact as to which company realistically takes the greater share of the risk?"
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2584.092,2585.28,And we think at both cases --
1976.75-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.28,2585.803,Rather than the terms of the contract.
1976.75-1221,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2585.803,2601.238,"Right and we think in both cases, First Railroad and Consumer, the findings of fact, you know, even in the District Court in First Railroad which held against the Government acknowledged that it was almost remote and negligible that the other company had pour any risks."
1976.75-1221,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2607.943,2609.604,Mr. Jones.
1976.75-1221,1,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2609.604,2613.065,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1221,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2685.753,2701.861,"In your situation, Penn Security, is there any privity between the insured person policy holder and the beneficiary on the one hand and the reinsurer?"
1976.75-1221,1,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2701.861,2703.087,No.
1976.75-1221,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2703.087,2708.093,Privily is between the initial insurer and the insurer and stops there?
1976.75-1221,1,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2708.093,2712.477,That is correct and of course the initial insurer is also not related to the reinsurer in our case.
1976.75-1221,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.881,3514.552,Very well Mr. Jones.
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3516.904,3529.377,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1221,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.199,3799.579,Mr. Harper is it critical to your position that there be a difference in the predictability of the morbidity risk as opposed to the mortality risk?
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3799.579,3807.133,"No, I think not only insofar as the reasons which would justify the undertaking."
1976.75-1221,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3807.486,3815.447,Is the rate charge for the life insurance in this credit business different for depending on age or the borrower?
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3817.101,3820.119,It is all term insurance.
1976.75-1221,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3820.119,3821.12,The rates vary with the age of the borrower?
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3821.12,3825.78,"It does -- it does not vary with the age, however the --"
1976.75-1221,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3825.78,3829.662,Well then how does your argument about mortality and all play in with this for it will concern the age.--
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3829.662,3840.253,"Well, it plays in here very definitely because you cannot take any portion of this accident and health risk insurance into income."
1976.75-1221,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3851.643,3858.385,"After each of the months passes, it's earned, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3858.385,3860.008,It is earned in a pro rata amount.
1976.75-1221,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3860.008,3860.796,Pro rata amount.
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3861.825,3863.527,"Now, I’d like to --"
1976.75-1221,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3863.527,3871.513,Aren’t the morbidity tables just about as reliable as the mortality tables?
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3871.976,3875.396,"Oh, I think they are just -- I think this are different names for the same as I’ve understood it --"
1976.75-1221,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3875.396,3876.626,No.
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,3877.344,3889.792,"This is just the reciprocal one or the other, but that does not predict the risk of going to the hospital for example or being disabled, but I must point out another reason."
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4067.817,4071.961,Mr. Harper let me just interrupt because there is something running through my mind that I’m not sure I understand.
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4083.802,4084.855,We had some --
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4084.855,4085.013,Is that correct?
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4085.013,4089.078,Our company originally acted as a reinsurance business for life insurance at one point.
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4089.078,4090.4,"Well, with the respect to the years that --"
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4090.4,4091.844,And there were some --
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4091.844,4099.287,"With respect to the years in issue, is it correct that you re-insured the accident and health business and not the life business?"
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4099.287,4100.412,I think that’s correct.
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4102.479,4107.013,Is there a business reason for that other than the favorable tax consequences?
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4107.013,4107.817,There is a business reason --
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4107.817,4108.531,"And if, so what is it?"
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4108.531,4110.805,-- in that we need a broader base.
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4130.038,4136.254,"Now, what was that broadened your base, the reinsurance of the A & H business, did that broaden your base?"
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4136.254,4137.948,"It did broaden the base, but of course it also --"
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4137.948,4142.022,Why wouldn’t it broaden it even more to re-insure the life business as well?
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4142.022,4147.745,"Well of course, the life business is a little more profitable among other things."
1976.75-1221,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4173.193,4179.1,"In other words on the A & H business, your primary motivation was to broaden the base at the sacrifice of some profit?"
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4185.154,4204.985,"Well, this made it possible to broaden or to sell more insurance across the board, very definitely and it was very critical to broaden the base because you have to set premiums and it has to be a reliable standard."
1976.75-1221,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4415.545,4421.829,You are using -- you are now getting into your colleague's time Mr. Harper.
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4421.829,4426.166,"I’m not through, but I quit.[Laughter]"
1976.75-1221,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4426.166,4429.947,Unless he wants to deal his time to you which --
1976.75-1221,2,30881,james_r_harper,,4429.947,4446.65,I’m sure he does.[Laughter]
1976.75-1221,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4446.65,4449.054,Mr. Masinter.
1976.75-1221,3,22713,e_michael_masinter,,4449.054,4452.264,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1221,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4971.187,4974.787,"Counsel could I just interrupt on one question, factual question."
1976.75-1221,3,22713,e_michael_masinter,,4984.45,5004.259,"Your Honor, I believe under the terms of the contract, the claim would have -- actually be paid by the direct insurer because a contract provides that to reinsurer shall reimburse the direct insurer, but other than the contract I don’t think there is any specific evidence on that point."
1976.75-1221,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5336.987,5341.144,Mr. Smith you have about two minutes left.
1976.75-1221,4,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5341.144,5341.333,Yes.
1976.75-1221,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5475.75,5476.641,Thank you gentleman.
