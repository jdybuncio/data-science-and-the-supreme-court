1965.23,0,31607,james_b_lewis,,36.329,40.35,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?"
1965.23,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,269.684,271.283,How long did he own it?
1965.23,0,31607,james_b_lewis,,271.283,274.324,For two years.
1965.23,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.0,306.23,"The rule for which he contends limited to the -- that year, that the year in which the sale was made."
1965.23,0,31607,james_b_lewis,,306.23,306.639,Yes.
1965.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,402.792,420.041,We'll recess now.
1965.23,0,31607,james_b_lewis,,420.041,429.727,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1965.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,881.902,883.23,He really what?
1965.23,0,31607,james_b_lewis,,883.23,886.862,He did not focus on the issue for the first 47 years.
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1536.469,1540.434,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1769.163,1796.713,"Mr. Levin, just before you do that, as I understood most of the laws, his point is that the ship brought the less at the end of 1957 than it would have brought in the sale at the beginning of 1957, which to a layman sounds reasonably sensible, perhaps it isn't."
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1796.713,1796.941,"Well, Your Honor --"
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1796.941,1814.214,"If that is so, if that is so and you'll tell me if it is not; if that is so, how do you reconcile -- how do you explain your statement that the use of the (Inaudible) 1957 cost the petitioner nothing?"
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1814.214,1816.58,I will not take issue with the fact.
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1861.838,1865.159,"But that's not this case, is it?"
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1865.159,1868.164,"Well, let me take that case first."
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1918.858,1918.865,"Perhaps, I know --"
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1918.865,1920.336,If he doesn't hire anyone --
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1920.336,1920.374,"Perhaps, I know --"
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1920.374,1921.886,-- he is not entitled to a deduction.
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1921.886,1934.066,"Perhaps, I'm mistaken Mr. Levin, but the amount that this taxpayer were to depreciate, it was the amount that he actually paid for the ship, isn't that right?"
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1934.066,1948.824,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that the -- in deduction for depreciation was intended to permit a man to deduct the entire amount he originally pays for an asset, but only his net cost."
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1948.824,1949.572,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1953.872,1954.461,"Yes, of course --"
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1954.461,1954.474,That is --
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1954.474,1956.124,-- it was based on original cost
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1956.124,1956.59,Yes.
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1956.59,1966.026,"However, at the time the taxpayer petitioner here sought to take that deduction, it knew that it was not going to incur that cost."
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1974.047,1976.828,"Excuse me, and this will be my last question for you."
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1976.828,1978.884,"I'm happy to have your questions, Your Honor."
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1978.884,1999.428,"But, your ship -- what do mean by, during when I -- what seems to me to be shifting back and forth between two price figures or cost figures are the latest cost figures, I want to be sure that I'm following you, this taxpayer has taken its original cost as the basis for depreciation."
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1999.428,1999.557,That's right.
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1999.557,2001.001,Isn't that right?
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2003.715,2004.003,That's right.
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2004.003,2014.908,-- not changed the market so that the taxpayer at the -- sometime in 1957 was able to realize the problem.
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2033.299,2035.069,"Yes, Your Honor, it was bona fide."
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2181.392,2185.767,"Mr. Levin, excuse me."
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2241.175,2244.254,"Well, as I read both the Code and the regulation"
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2244.254,2247.585,"I want to know, I want to know what you said about that paragraph."
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2247.585,2248.674,"Which paragraph, Your Honor?"
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2248.674,2254.028,"On page 65 of the record, which is the paragraph that I assume is referred then in your brief."
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2254.028,2255.919,Yes.
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2266.342,2270.751,"Now, does the -- has anything in the letter that goes beyond the termination date?"
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2270.751,2271.0,No.
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2276.085,2276.662,So that in your brief --
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2276.662,2277.471,-- subsequent experience may warrant.
1965.23,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2277.471,2282.219,"-- in your brief, on pages 2 and 3, it has to be read with that --"
1965.23,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2282.219,2282.563,No.
1965.23,2,31607,james_b_lewis,,3682.323,3686.364,May it please the Court.
