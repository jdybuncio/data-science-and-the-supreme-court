1970.345,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.538,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 345, United States against Freed and Sutherland."
1970.345,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,11.919,14.813,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,1600.587,1604.473,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1697.167,1712.2,"How does the -- how would the possession or non-possession of this permit on the part of the police officer have anything to do whatever with the conduct of the purchaser, what's that got to do with him?"
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,1712.2,1717.355,"Well, but what we’re talking -- well, because the conduct of the police officer creates the crime without which there would be no crime."
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.355,1720.875,If he had a piece of paper would it be alright?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,1720.875,1725.836,"If he complied with the law the transferee would’ve not committed the crime, that's correct."
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.836,1728.267,What I'm – now tell me that --
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,1728.267,1734.938,"In other words, the police officer by violating the law and created the criminal that is the transferee."
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1745.932,1755.424,"Wasn’t that the purpose of Congress to put a burden on the purchasers, the receivers to find that out and did he make any effort to find out whether --"
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,1755.424,1769.103,"Well, I know of nothing in the statutory history, or one way or the other the appellants concede for example that it’s entirely silent and it doesn’t seem to be much discussion at all other than the fact that if you like, they like to get around the Haynes decision in passing the legislation."
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.264,1906.923,"I think you're losing me, how is this different from what you have to do with the passports and automobile driver’s license and great many other things?"
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,1906.923,1920.199,"Well, I don’t think that only goes a great deal of difference in terms of what you actually have to do, but if you take the raw activity of something let’s say we have no Fifth Amendment, nothing testimonial about say a fingerprint or the handwriting is similar."
1970.345,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.19,2050.462,I was talking only about count two of the indictment?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2050.462,2054.08,"We’re talking only about count two of the indictment at that point, yes sir."
1970.345,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2054.08,2057.059,Because count one does they contain those allegations?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2057.059,2063.94,"Yes it does just through the -- I have a quarrel with count one of the indictment or another for another reason but at that point, no."
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2514.656,2519.55,Do you mean exacted by the Constitution or by statute?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2519.55,2553.516,"That’s a tricky question and I suggest I have some thoughts on it but on either basis I think the Court might say as a matter of constitutional law but if it chooses not to put on that basis, I think it would be a reasonable statement to say that when we’re talking about this kind of crime with this kind of penalty that Congress should have the affirmative obligation of making a quite express as to whether they feel they want strict liability or whether they're going to eliminate the mens rea requirement rather than to rely upon the position of the appellant which is because it’s not spelled out in the statute that Congress never intended to be there."
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2595.976,2598.979,Can you not rely on your constitutional --
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2598.979,2601.442,On the constitutional level?
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2610.144,2611.805,What about the Dotterweich case?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2611.805,2612.626,Pardon me?
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2612.626,2615.524,What about the Dotterweich case written by Mr. Justice Frank?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2615.524,2618.832,"Yes, well the Dotterweich case of course involves only a misdemeanor really."
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2653.052,2656.292,"Well, would that make any difference of constitutionally speaking?"
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2656.292,2659.229,"It could, I think it will be for this Court to say one way or the other."
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2725.33,2738.55,"The implication of that argument would be that Congress is incapable constitutionally of making the possession of anything alone, the mere possession a felony?"
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2738.55,2744.765,"No, I would necessarily say that even though that's I think attainable proposition but what I'm saying is I think they would have to justify it."
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2777.223,2783.061,(Voice Overlap) constitutionally or construction to the statute?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2783.061,2788.761,"Well, of course the easiest thing would be make a construction of the statute because then the Congress has the option of making a change and the Court (Voice Overlaps) --"
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2788.761,2792.069,So what power would the Court have to hold it unconstitutional?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2792.069,2792.623,Pardon me?
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2792.623,2796.176,What power would the Court have to hold it unconstitutional?
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2800.659,2804.735,"Well, the Court would have to in that particular proposition Mr. Justice Black."
1970.345,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2816.034,2818.929,(Voice Overlap)
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2818.929,2825.203,I wouldn’t expect that we would get your vote on that kind of an analysis reaching that kind of a result.
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.13,2919.627,"No, we are just recessing."
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,2933.528,2935.204,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3245.182,3254.234,"Well, would you make the same argument about people who wanted to possess fissionable material under the Atomic Energy Act?"
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,3275.243,3283.613,"Well, if there are other statutes they would make the possession a fissionable material unlawful per se then I would think that we would have a Marchetti, Grosso, Haynes situation."
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3295.347,3299.614,"Well, on your face, does the Atomic Energy Act has an infirmity on it then?"
1970.345,1,34783,luke_mckissack,,3299.614,3300.789,"Well, I’ll be quite honest with you."
1970.345,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3352.017,3359.13,Thank you Mr. McKissack.
1970.345,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3359.699,3362.971,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.345,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3404.622,3409.404,"Well, what are you suggesting then that either one or the other of these arguments is perfectly good?"
1970.345,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3409.404,3414.353,I'm suggesting that they’re both incorrect Mr. Justice that the due process --
1970.345,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.353,3416.742,As announced in the --
1970.345,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3416.742,3419.523,I think they are internally inconsistent but looking at each one separately --
1970.345,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.523,3420.174,Both are bad?
1970.345,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3420.174,3422.319,"Yes, I think both are bad."
1970.345,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3604.091,3615.007,"If the judge had undertaken to pass on the entrapment issue as suggested perhaps, could that have reached here?"
1970.345,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3619.946,3621.699,It seems to me if the --
1970.345,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3621.699,3623.272,Wouldn’t it be a case of the Court Of Appeals?
1970.345,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,3623.272,3646.894,"Usually, it would be but it seems to me if the Court adhered to the views expressed by the majority in the Sorrels and Sherman case that the question of entrapment is one of -- going to the statutory interpretation -- going to statutory interpretation rather than the supervisory power of the Court."
1970.345,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3676.548,3680.146,Thank you.
