1999.99-830,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.748,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-830, Don Stenberg v. Leroy Carhart."
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,9.715,13.089,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,55.291,57.947,"General Stenberg, I just would like to clarify one thing."
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,67.254,80.061,"Well, that... the statute would cover both pre-viability and post viability, Your Honor, but I believe it was the legislature's observation that, whether viable or not, that it's important--"
1999.99-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.061,84.607,"This case concerns only the pre-viable stage, is that not so?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,84.607,85.06,--Yes.
1999.99-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,97.946,98.492,I take it--
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,98.492,100.289,"--Covers both, Your Honor."
1999.99-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,100.289,110.58,"--I take it that save with respect to a... an exception to save the woman's life, and so on, that post viability abortions are generally precluded, by the State."
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,110.58,111.643,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1999.99-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,111.643,116.672,"Post viability abortions are generally prohibited, I assume, by separate statute."
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,116.672,117.031,Yes.
1999.99-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,148.487,153.407,"But General, isn't the bright line between infanticide and abortion at the... a claim of viability?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,155.656,158.89,--I think that 30 States--
1999.99-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,158.89,160.437,"It does draw that bright line, doesn't it?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,160.437,162.153,"--Well, that would be a line."
1999.99-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,166.653,174.822,"No, but that is a bright line that separates post viability from pre-viability abortions, since one is legal and the other is illegal, under Nebraska law?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,174.822,185.74,"Well, that is under one Nebraska statute, that's correct, Your Honor, but the legislature has also been concerned about the partial birth abortion procedure which led to the passage of this particular statute."
1999.99-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.74,196.578,"General Stenberg, I took it that what you meant when you said it bordered on infanticide had nothing to do with the viability of the fetus, but that the procedure looks more like infanticide--"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,196.578,197.578,Yes.
1999.99-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.578,211.916,"--when the child is killed outside the womb than when it is killed inside the womb, and therefore it can coarsen public perception to other forms of killing fetuses or children outside the womb."
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,214.728,221.21,"That is precisely the point, Your Honor, and that is precisely what motivated the legislature of the State of Nebraska in this case."
1999.99-830,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.594,357.047,"Was this a facial challenge, General Stenberg?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,357.047,359.859,This was pled as a facial challenge.
1999.99-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,373.462,378.709,"But General Stenberg, in the very first paragraph of the Judge's opinion it says, I do not reach the question of whether the law is facially invalid."
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,378.709,381.24,"Well, I understand... and I mention--"
1999.99-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,381.24,382.551,He held it invalid as to this doctor.
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,382.551,388.471,"--And frankly I think, Your Honor, that the district court was simply wrong in its characterization of this case."
1999.99-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,393.392,396.937,"Well, the injunction is just limited to against this doctor and his patients, isn't it?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,396.937,400.077,--I think what the district court may have had in mind--
1999.99-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,400.077,402.06,"Well, am I correct in that?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,402.06,402.685,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1999.99-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.685,406.371,Am I correct that the injunction only applies to this doctor and his patients?
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,406.371,412.476,"And similarly situated individuals, is the way I believe the court's order read, Your Honor."
1999.99-830,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,412.476,419.755,"How did the court of appeals... did the court of appeals say whether it was treating this as a facial challenge, or an as-applied challenge?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,419.755,427.018,"It seems... my reading of the circuit court was that they viewed it as an applied... or, excuse me, as a facial challenge."
1999.99-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.326,458.209,"Mr. Stenberg, do you take the position that the State of Nebraska could also prohibit the dilation and evacuation procedure for pre-viability abortions?"
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,458.209,462.223,"Well, under... under Danforth, Your Honor, that was still--"
1999.99-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,462.223,464.238,"Well, I just wanted your position."
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,465.487,482.635,"--For purposes of this case, the State's position would be that the State could not prohibit the D&E procedure, but also the State has not attempted to prohibit the D&E procedure."
1999.99-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,482.635,489.617,"I know that's the position you take, but it is difficult to read the statute and be certain that that is so."
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,498.848,499.801,I think--
1999.99-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,499.801,511.092,--and I'm not certain whether the statute might not prohibit the D&E procedure as well.
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,511.092,525.415,"--It's our position, Your Honor, that it does not prohibit the D&E procedure, and I'd like to address that question first from a, kind of an institutional standpoint and then turn specifically to the language of the statute."
1999.99-830,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.865,577.067,Does the Attorney General in the State of Nebraska issue rulings or opinion letters?
1999.99-830,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,577.067,579.035,"We do, Your Honor."
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1636.976,1641.349,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-830,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.331,1690.031,"Well, but are... are you defending the court of appeals' construction of the statute here?"
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1690.031,1691.0,Yes.
1999.99-830,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1691.0,1705.229,"Do you think the court of appeals followed our admonition that when you have two plausible constructions available and one would avoid constitutional difficulty, you should follow that, even though it's a State statute?"
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1705.229,1706.885,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1999.99-830,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.941,1768.875,Do we ordinarily go into the testimony of witnesses?
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1770.922,1772.047,--That's correct.
1999.99-830,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.047,1776.482,And what... what authority do they have to speak to the construction of a statute?
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1776.482,1790.148,"No, I'm not talking about their authority to speak to the construction of the statute, but describing how abortion procedures actually occur and how they are performed and then comparing that to the language of the statute to see if the steps that occur in abortion--"
1999.99-830,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.148,1792.304,These witnesses compared it to the language of the statute?
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1792.304,1792.663,--No.
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.833,1802.893,"Well, I... I must say I don't understand... I don't understand that conclusion."
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1848.814,1869.336,"The factual findings of the district court are quite clear that the way the D&E typically occurs is that the physician partially delivers the intact, living fetus into the vagina while it... before fetal demise has occurred, so that there is a living, unborn child partially in the uterus and partially outside the uterus."
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.336,1885.752,"But in order to... for the purpose of killing it, partially delivers... the term partially delivers a living... the unborn child means deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living, unborn child."
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1899.607,1901.762,Yes.
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.762,1902.199,Yes?
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1902.199,1904.369,In every pre-viability--
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.369,1905.728,That's not my understanding of the D&E at all.
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1910.899,1913.116,--That's not what the district court found.
1999.99-830,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.154,1940.605,"You mean that some of the time D&E could be that, or all the time?"
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1950.382,1951.1,That's right.
1999.99-830,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1953.053,1953.646,The majority?
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1953.646,1954.599,--That's right.
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.562,1976.077,"No, but it has to be more than just bringing it."
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,1985.963,2000.098,"--Actually Dr. Carhart, in each second trimester abortion by D&E that he performs, sets out to bring as much of the fetus out of the uterus at once as possible because it reduces risks to... to the women."
1999.99-830,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2003.736,2004.127,Well--
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,2004.127,2006.531,"So, his intention is always to do that, if possible."
1999.99-830,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.531,2019.729,"--As you describe these two procedures, which in your view seem to come close together, the American Medical Association and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons are just confused on this point?"
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,2019.729,2025.915,"Well, the American Medical Association described the D&X technique as a form of D&E."
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.371,2053.263,Where... where is that?
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,2057.572,2058.822,Certainly.
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.07,2111.598,"Well, they... they describe it as a form of DE... D&E not in that, like D&E, it involves partial birth of the child."
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,2115.207,2125.235,"Well, the factual findings of the district court established that in all D&E's the fetus is brought through the vagina and out of the woman's body."
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.171,2129.389,"Ultimately, yes, but not... not always intact and not always alive."
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,2129.389,2130.842,--Typically intact and alive.
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.541,2155.457,"Why... why would you be able to do a D&E and... as I understand it, the... the D&X is only possible 90 to 95 percent of the time that he attempts it."
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,2156.254,2160.128,"Well, it's possible about... he is able to do it about 10 percent of the time."
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.128,2160.643,Yes.
1999.99-830,1,41464,simon_heller,,2164.251,2165.235,Right.
1999.99-830,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.235,2167.188,What makes it impossible?
1999.99-830,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3440.995,3443.636,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.99-830,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3465.611,3468.282,"Why didn't they just say that, General Stenberg?"
1999.99-830,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3479.449,3489.118,Because the Nebraska legislature was relying on the American Medical Association and the Congress of the United States and patterned their legislation on that.
1999.99-830,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3501.239,3510.392,"Did the medical... American Medical Association recommend this text or did they simply say, in our judgment, it's okay to ban D&X?"
1999.99-830,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3510.392,3510.767,No.
1999.99-830,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3522.543,3533.835,"Well, is there any question that they would have supported a ban that simply said what you tell me the legislature meant, that is, we ban D&X and nothing else?"
1999.99-830,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3533.835,3537.334,"There's... of course, there's more than one way to achieve the same result, Your Honor."
1999.99-830,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3538.85,3541.817,You would just be saying that the AMA liked this other text.
1999.99-830,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3549.079,3560.076,"--Well, of course, viewed from, I think, the standpoint of a State Senator in... in the State of Nebraska, they're not really in a position to go to the AMA and say, well, is there some other language that might be just as good?"
1999.99-830,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3561.809,3562.668,But there was a medical term.
1999.99-830,2,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3581.566,3593.593,"Well, there was some doubt because in 1997 there were several terms used to describe this procedure, the D&X, the intact D&E, the intact D&X, and the Haskell D&X."
1999.99-830,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3614.849,3617.662,"Thank you, General Stenberg."
