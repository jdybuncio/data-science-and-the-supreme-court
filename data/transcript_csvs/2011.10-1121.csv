2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1121, Knox v. the Service Employees International Union."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,10.172,13.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1121,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,68.06,72.346,"Mr. Young, could I ask you to speak to the mootness question first?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,72.346,73.881,I was just addressing that.
2011.10-1121,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,73.881,81.785,"As -- as I understand your brief, you're -- you're essentially saying that it's impossible to moot a claim for nominal damages."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,84.904,89.141,"I'm not sure I would go that far, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1121,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,111.971,114.606,"So that's a different point, right, which is that the notice was inadequate--"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,114.606,115.791,That would be correct.
2011.10-1121,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,115.791,120.843,"--And when you say ""inadequate"", I read you to be saying sort of not apologetic enough."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,141.157,143.776,"Not in this case, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1121,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,169.426,171.212,And how is that?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,178.866,187.137,The -- the district court had ordered -- described the type of notice that it anticipated.
2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,249.545,254.866,"And the reason that's important in terms of the content of the notice, the inadequacy, is what?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,254.866,268.423,"The reason that is important, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, excuse me -- is that the SEIU is asserting that the case has become moot because it has now complied with the district court's judgment."
2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,268.423,281.783,"I thought -- I thought your argument was that the -- a different type of notice would have resulted in more members electing to opt out, to demand the refund of their assessments?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,281.783,283.968,And that's certainly one of the possible consequences.
2011.10-1121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,307.083,316.539,"If the special assessment requires a different kind of notice, and possibly a different kind of opt-in or opt-out regime, would the case be moot?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,316.539,321.574,"If the notice -- I'm sorry, I didn't understand."
2011.10-1121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,321.574,328.33,"Well, we're not dealing here with the kind of notice -- with the typical Hudson notice given at the beginning of the year, when the annual dues are collected."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,336.686,339.236,"No, it would not."
2011.10-1121,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,347.292,361.735,"My question is whether the -- the different requirements, which presumably were not met here in the context of the special assessment, if there are different requirements in that context, would that be enough to preserve this case as a live controversy?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,361.735,375.228,"--So long as the union failed to provide them, and at least in this case, the district court's judgment, we believe, provides an adequate respect for Hudson's underlying requirement, Justice Alito."
2011.10-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,375.228,376.078,Mr. -- Mr. Young--
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,376.078,376.745,"Yes, Justice--"
2011.10-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,376.745,388.719,"--as I understand, the union recognizes that a consequence of mootness would be that the Ninth Circuit judgment is vacated."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,409.966,424.892,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, and this is why: The union would remain free to return to its old ways -- the very type of reason that this Court declined to find mootness in W.T. Grant."
2011.10-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.193,456.113,But it wasn't -- this case is about a completed episode.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,460.584,463.703,"That is true, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,482.83,483.614,Does it have--
2011.10-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.614,487.234,"Well, are you saying that it's capable of repetition, yet aiding review?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,488.018,490.686,"It would certainly be so in this case, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,503.678,505.863,Does the injunction have future -- future terms?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,511.449,517.753,"Just -- just to be clear, there is -- I'm talking about something that's tantamount to an injunction, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-1121,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,524.591,540.203,"But isn't that important, Mr. Young, because usually where we've talked about capable repetition, or where we've talked about the same thing could happen again, it's where an injunction has been before us rather than a suit for damages as to a past act."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,540.203,543.405,"Yes, Justice Kagan, I think that has been generally the case."
2011.10-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,623.023,624.907,Do you make that argument in your opposition?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,624.907,644.62,"It -- it seems to me, Justice Kennedy, it is implicit in our argument, although clearly our main point in that argument is that this is a -- a paradigm case of voluntary cessation of allegedly unlawful activity."
2011.10-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,657.428,672.92,"--But that's another -- something quite different than the capable of returning to old ways, because here we do have a discrete episode that's over."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,696.136,699.005,"That's -- that's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1121,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,710.813,719.734,"Well, they said that it had become moot because they gave you all the relief you requested, so there was nothing left to the case."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,719.734,724.305,"--Well, ""all the relief"", Justice Ginsburg, implies that they had complied with the district court's judgment."
2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,738.232,740.265,Maybe it's a good point for you to move to the merits.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,740.265,741.7,"--Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,741.7,744.386,Could I ask you a question about the merits?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,744.386,746.838,"Yes, certainly, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,746.838,762.78,"Are you attacking the normal system of basing assessments moving forward, based on past accounting and chargeability and non-chargeability?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,766.549,768.834,"I -- I appreciate the question, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,774.388,774.988,All right.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,815.748,818.116,"--Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,833.376,835.06,Articulate that again?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,837.577,844.767,"--A material increase -- or increase in general terms, in the obligation imposed upon the nonmembers."
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.421,853.623,A material new assessment?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,853.623,856.741,"--A material new assessment, yes, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.741,857.141,Okay.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,858.041,858.725,"Yes, we are."
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.175,859.443,Okay.
2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,859.443,864.662,But without regard to the reason for the assessment?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,864.662,868.966,"--I think as a matter of principle I would have to say yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,871.335,903.989,"Well, I'm not sure that -- that -- this may just simply be repeating Justice Sotomayor's question, but if they say we have to raise the assessment 10 percent because, as she said, you know, we estimated the printing costs for the union newsletter, whatever, was going to be this and it turns out they raised it, it's going to be that, so we know we are going to have to get additional money for things that are indisputably chargeable, why do you need special procedures in that case?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,903.989,910.543,"--Well, it wouldn't be so much a special procedure as a new opportunity to object and challenge the amount of the fee, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.268,974.902,"It's -- it's peculiar, because in the circumstance where the extra assessment is all going to go to chargeable activities, in fact that means economically speaking the following year the objector will be better off, not worse off, because there is a higher percentage of the total fee that's being paid to chargeable activities."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,993.547,997.899,"Justice Breyer, the reason for the notice is these people may not trust the union."
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1001.052,1002.219,I see that point.
2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.039,1007.456,Go ahead.
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1007.456,1007.823,--All right.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1009.573,1010.325,Sure.
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1010.325,1014.693,And now I -- but I think I see what your answer is.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1028.887,1029.787,"Yes, sir."
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1029.787,1037.993,"And normally under Hudson that means in year 2 the deal is, the objectors pay 70 percent, right?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1037.993,1039.225,Yes.
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.225,1047.181,"In the middle of year 2, surprisingly, something comes up."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1061.274,1063.876,"That would be correct, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1066.412,1069.53,--Can they take the money that they collected?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1069.53,1070.43,--I'm sorry?
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1070.43,1095.079,"Can they take the money that they collected under the first notice and, instead of doing a special assessment, in the middle of it this campaign gets announced by the governor, and can they then divert the chargeable amount that they have predicted and spend it on the non-chargeable amount?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1100.466,1102.085,"I understand, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.168,1109.655,"All right, so this is a peculiar rule that you have asked us to adopt."
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.643,1143.928,Do you concede that it is going to make them better off?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1155.919,1156.769,That's--
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.769,1161.188,--whether -- whether it's all going to be used for -- for assessable activities or not.
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.722,1163.239,Right.
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.922,1171.495,"--At the very least, they have to make a -- an interest-free loan to the -- to the union until such time as they can challenge it."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1171.495,1173.328,"--Well, that's exactly correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1173.328,1190.29,"--Yes, but the hypothetical, if I could continue with it, is -- is perhaps unrealistic, but they have 20 bishops and the 14 most honest people in the United States, and they have all absolutely guaranteed and everybody agrees that this goes to chargeable activity."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1194.527,1194.861,Yes.
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.311,1196.244,And combine the two.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1229.95,1233.402,"Well, I recall the bishops from the last time I was here, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.702,1235.954,They are useful to me.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1237.038,1237.704,"They are, I'm sure."
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.704,1244.293,"I assume we wouldn't need a Hudson notice at all, if -- if bishops affirmed all of these things, right?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1245.343,1247.159,"You anticipate my next point, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1263.271,1280.3,"The problem is in this system, going back to Justice Breyer's practicality, they will get a chance to object; it just won't be at the moment of the special assessment; it will be the following year."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1318.925,1323.042,"--Then the problem is, Justice Sotomayor, understanding the practice--"
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1323.042,1323.977,Is there an answer to that?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1325.578,1329.363,--They will get a chance to object after they have already paid the interest-free loan.
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1329.363,1332.665,But that's true of the first example I gave you.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1347.258,1353.579,"And the nonmembers would have the chance to challenge that, but it would be within the normal system of ordinary union dues."
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.369,1373.392,"Isn't -- isn't the premise of Hudson that you give the notice before, before you -- you receive the notice before you have to cough up the money?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1373.392,1374.192,Yes.
2011.10-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.192,1382.181,"And what's now proposed is, well, for -- if there is an additional assessment, you cough up the money first and then later you straighten it out."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1384.8,1386.217,"That seems to me to be the problem, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1421.223,1426.277,Does your Hudson notice tell you about what is going to happen next year?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1439.252,1444.989,"--The Hudson notice provides you with an opportunity to object and some assurance, because of the audit requirement--"
2011.10-1121,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.989,1446.19,But am I right in my description of it?
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1446.19,1448.809,"--I think that would be a fair description, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1448.809,1455.563,"Do they carry over from 1 year to the next, or do you have to refile your objection to the union expenditures every year?"
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1455.563,1460.617,"Most unions, Mr. Chief Justice, require an annual objection."
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1478.26,1480.579,But going back to the -- forget about special assessments.
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1514.335,1516.787,"--Correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1121,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1522.822,1568.434,"So I guess my problem is I don't see how that, given your argument, is any less alone than this special assessment where the labor -- where the objecting members at the end of the year will get notice of what has happened that year, will have an opportunity to place their Lehnert challenges and get them ruled upon, and will, as Justice Breyer said, have a benefit because they are going to either pay more if the Lehnert -- pay less if the Lehnert challenges are upheld or pay more if -- if they're not."
2011.10-1121,0,46657,william_j_young,,1571.386,1577.974,"--Well, we disagree with the union's characterization of its supposed benefit."
2011.10-1121,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1587.062,1587.897,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,1594.585,1597.287,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1610.111,1612.88,Why did you give up once the case was granted here?
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,1616.599,1632.043,"That's correct, Your Honor, and the reason for that is when the events in this matter were new and the then union officers' actions were being challenged, the instinct was: We are going to defend the case."
2011.10-1121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1678.589,1686.611,"What is this local, and what will the other locals do in the future when special assessments are made?"
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,1691.165,1700.705,"This local -- and I won't belabor the term ""special assessment"" at the moment, but when we get to the merits I think there is a misunderstanding around that, Justice Alito."
2011.10-1121,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1749.001,1771.951,"Mr. Collins, as I understand Mr. Young's argument, there is a serious dispute about the adequacy of this notice, and it might be a dispute about whether it was clear enough, about that it was satisfying claims, or it might be a dispute about whether it allowed refunds easily enough, but that Mr. Young is contesting whether the notice complied with the district court's order."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,1789.828,1791.964,"No, it doesn't, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1851.253,1853.855,But this is not -- this is not an incidental matter.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,1891.896,1895.615,"I think that's incorrect, Mr. Chief Justice, for two reasons."
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1920.713,1922.932,"I'm sorry, I don't see how that -- I don't see how that works."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,1938.461,1940.494,"No, I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2106.166,2108.535,I want you to move to the merits.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2111.07,2111.703,All right.
2011.10-1121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2114.522,2116.557,Can I clarify a point?
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2129.464,2138.137,"--No, it has a provision that it can't be repealed without a 180-day notice."
2011.10-1121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2140.672,2141.422,--I see.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2141.422,2151.98,"But I do want to make clear, we think nothing -- our position on mootness is not dependent on the Court determining that the new procedure will be in effect forever."
2011.10-1121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2152.664,2161.586,Could you tell me what the burden is on the union to give a second Hudson notice whenever there is a special assessment?
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2174.845,2182.083,"--That requires a fairly extensive answer, I believe, Justice Sotomayor, partly because--"
2011.10-1121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2182.083,2183.349,Try to summarize it.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2184.835,2192.489,"--I believe -- I believe the word ""special assessment"" is being used here with a meaning that doesn't correspond to what this union did."
2011.10-1121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2307.98,2312.95,"Is it incorrect that this was for what was termed a ""Political Fight-Back Fund""?"
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2312.95,2322.573,--It was -- some union communications described it as having that sole -- that purpose.
2011.10-1121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2359.246,2366.085,"Well, let me give you this example and maybe you will say that this is different from your case and the rules should be different in these two cases."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2429.341,2446.453,"--If I understand the hypothetical, there could be a problem there if the assumption is then that the union really is beginning a kind of spending that's really foreign to the way it's spent money in the past."
2011.10-1121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2477.139,2485.245,"Well, as I said, my hypothetical may be very different from what happened here, and maybe it's an unrealistic hypothetical and you can answer that."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2489.297,2502.873,"Well, the problem -- it would be a closer question, but I think not, because again it would be caught up in the subsequent year."
2011.10-1121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2502.873,2507.491,But what if the money is going to be used for an election campaign?
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2528.005,2528.821,It would depend--
2011.10-1121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2528.821,2538.11,--and given the opportunity not to give what would be at a minimum an interest-free loan for the purposes of influencing an election campaign?
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2538.11,2539.878,"--It would depend, Justice Alito."
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2589.145,2592.097,"I thought your point, though, was this was a very special ballot initiative."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2600.703,2615.879,"--Well, I don't -- I wouldn't call it a special assessment if one uses that term as it is usually used, to mean a very short-term assessment apart from general union functions for a new kind of function."
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2615.879,2617.963,That's not short-term; it's just until November 7th or whatever.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2617.963,2620.347,"But it's nothing new under the sun, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.034,2651.136,Can you think for a second to go back to Justice Sotomayor.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2765.225,2766.142,--I -- I--
2011.10-1121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2766.142,2766.861,And a footnote.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2770.063,2771.996,"--I will get to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2818.71,2820.496,Could you please answer my question?
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2820.496,2821.061,--The burden.
2011.10-1121,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2821.061,2821.512,All right.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2822.061,2826.649,"The burden consists of two things, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2866.207,2875.063,One reason -- I mean we are dealing with a situation where the union is compelling nonunion members to give them money for political activities.
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,2929.217,2953.598,"The reason, Mr. Chief Justice, that it isn't that straight forward is quite simply that all of these questions about it's a special assessment, we can figure out what it is, we can treat it separately, flounder when one realizes that so-called special assessment is simply a dues increase."
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3032.7,3035.902,"But, I mean -- I'm reading from the district court opinion."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,3062.569,3064.752,"But two points, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3100.492,3124.976,"Suppose -- suppose that the proponents of Propositions 75 and 76 had come to the union and said, would you please give us an interest-free loan for money, because we want to use this money to -- to persuade the -- the electorate to enact these, but don't worry, because we're going to pay it back right after the election, when we've achieved our electoral ends."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,3128.845,3136.933,I -- I really can't answer that question.
2011.10-1121,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3137.483,3141.052,"Well, I -- gee, I really doubt that you -- that they would."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,3164.285,3165.953,"That's not the situation here, Justice Alito."
2011.10-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3234.161,3245.468,"It -- it seems to me that this answer is, it's so confusing that the Court probably should consider whether or not an opt-in requirement is -- is preferable."
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,3281.042,3284.695,"--I won't avoid the -- I don't believe -- I was not meaning to avoid it, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3315.565,3332.676,"Let me ask you this, just in the way of background: In collective bargaining negotiations, do the unions consider the -- as one factor the importance of ensuring that the government or employer has fiscal stability?"
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,3332.676,3335.478,"--That's generally considered, yes."
2011.10-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3335.478,3343.282,"Isn't that ultimately a political judgment, so that even collective bargaining involves a core political judgment?"
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,3343.282,3345.668,And that's exactly what the Court said in Abood.
2011.10-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3367.183,3381.091,"But you -- you concede then in ordinary collective bargaining, there are critical and important significant political judgments that are being made by the union in the course of collective bargaining with chargeable expenses?"
2011.10-1121,1,29535,jeremiah_collins,,3381.091,3381.841,Absolutely.
2011.10-1121,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.52,3424.286,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3424.286,3429.424,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.424,3436.078,"Mr. Young, I hope this won't use up much of your time, but I do have a pressing question to make sure that we're just not spinning our wheels here."
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3475.703,3477.905,"It would be free to do so, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3477.905,3478.955,So why are we wasting our time?
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3487.443,3491.414,"Because the nonmembers still have that right to challenge, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1121,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3491.414,3494.782,But they don't lose it; they're going to do it the following September.
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3527.17,3533.407,"And money is fungible to a degree, Justice Sotomayor -- Sotomayor -- excuse me."
2011.10-1121,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3544.965,3545.615,Okay.
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3552.586,3555.571,"--I lose, Justice Scalia, and it will happen all the time, I'm afraid."
2011.10-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3555.571,3571.866,"Well, but the -- the problem if you win in this case, and then there is this other way of getting to the same -- the same result -- is that the other way of getting to the same -- same result, while permissible, is far less transparent."
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3604.171,3605.121,But--
2011.10-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3605.121,3606.622,So that's -- go ahead.
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3606.622,3607.772,"--And I thank you, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1121,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3624.751,3633.69,"The problem is that I am being told by your adversary, and since we don't know, I'm always afraid of writing a decision in a vacuum, okay?"
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3633.69,3634.157,Sure.
2011.10-1121,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3634.157,3648.449,"That union structure, their business in a myriad number of ways, that some have a very small due each year, and a larger special assessment for special projects."
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3673.415,3675.034,"Well, the issue -- I'm sorry."
2011.10-1121,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3675.034,3676.267,"Briefly, counsel."
2011.10-1121,2,46657,william_j_young,,3676.267,3677.902,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1121,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3696.547,3697.18,"Thank you, counsel."
