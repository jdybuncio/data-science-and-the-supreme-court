2012.12-398,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-398, Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.--"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,11.239,13.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-398,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,50.183,66.942,"Mr. Hansen, Respondents say that isolating or extracting natural products, that has long been considered patentable, and give -- examples were aspirin and whooping cough vaccine."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,73.262,76.833,"Well, in -- in essence, Your Honor, everything starts with a natural product."
2012.12-398,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,101.116,108.519,"Do you dispute that you can patent, however, a process for extracting naturally-occurring things?"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,108.519,109.221,--Of course.
2012.12-398,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,123.329,128.616,So isn't that -- why isn't that a way to in effect have patent protection for the product?
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,139.157,143.942,"Well, the -- the process by which it's extracted is now very routine."
2012.12-398,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,143.942,144.81,"Oh, no -- yes, I know."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,159.035,172.562,"I think they have to find a different way of extracting it, in the same way that finding a method of extracting gold does entitle you to a patent on the method of extracting gold, it may also entitle you to a patent on the use of gold."
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,180.901,183.602,Can you tell me why their test wasn't given a patent?
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,191.106,199.362,"--The tests are also routine and conventional science, but in this particular case, there were some method claims that we challenged."
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.407,224.929,"Well, I'm curious as to why the methodology of extracting the gene has not been patented."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,227.631,232.5,"--The original -- the original methodology was patented, and is -- is patentable."
2012.12-398,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,242.474,250.395,"Can I take you back to -- to Justice Ginsburg's question, because I'm -- I don't -- I'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,290.205,298.561,"If there is no alteration, if we simply pick the leaf off of the tree and swallow it and it has some additional value, then I think it is not patentable."
2012.12-398,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,304.881,308.916,But you're making -- you keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're intended to be.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,324.342,330.246,"--No, that may well be eligible, because you have now taken what was in nature and you've transformed it in two ways."
2012.12-398,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,347.475,353.361,"Well, when you concede that, then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA here, because it has a different function."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,369.407,373.025,"--Well, I don't think it has a new function, Your Honor, with respect."
2012.12-398,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,424.458,434.349,"From what you know and from what the record shows, would the process of tagging the isolated DNA be patentable?"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,438.217,447.407,The very patents in this case include claims on -- on DNA that is tagged so that it can be used as a probe.
2012.12-398,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,451.442,461.583,"Under our -- our law, is a patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the part?"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,461.583,468.504,"No, it is not permissible under patent law to do essentially a narrowing -- narrowing construction of the -- of the claim."
2012.12-398,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,468.504,472.122,"But if you haven't challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect to the tagging?"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,479.044,479.878,"Oh, I'm sorry, no."
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,497.84,500.475,Then -- then explain when you said you can't narrow.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,502.175,503.194,--Yes.
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,511.599,513.465,"All right, that individual claim is invalid."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,513.465,514.051,That individual claim.
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,514.051,518.253,But the patent with respect to claims that are not invalid would still stand.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,518.253,518.903,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,518.903,520.538,The primers and probes stand.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,520.538,522.221,Would -- would still remain.
2012.12-398,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,528.192,535.381,"Mr. Hansen, could you tell me what you think the incentives are for a company to do what Myriad did?"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,564.984,568.702,"Well, we know that would not have happened in this particular case, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.096,612.065,But you still haven't answered her question.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,620.571,624.706,"Well, taxpayers paid for much of the investment in Myriad's work, but--"
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.706,626.023,You're still not answering the question.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,626.023,627.575,--But -- yeah.
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.496,637.346,Curiosity is your answer.
2012.12-398,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,637.346,638.032,I thought you were going to--
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,638.032,639.315,"--Sometimes, because they want a Nobel Prize."
2012.12-398,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,639.948,660.279,"--I thought you were going to say something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped you were going to say something else, which is that, notwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this gene, that -- that there are still, you know, various things that you could get a patent on that would make this kind of investment worthwhile in the usual case."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,678.923,683.744,--Let me give a specific example that may be helpful in doing a better job of answering the question.
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.308,731.942,Yes.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,748.087,749.237,Well--
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.237,753.658,"I mean, sure, yes, I can do stuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,762.596,766.048,"--No, I think you get enormous recognition, but I don't think--"
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.048,766.748,"Well, that's lovely."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,766.748,768.583,--But I think that we know that that's sufficient.
2012.12-398,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.719,777.356,"Well, I'm not sure the Court can decide the case on -- on that basis."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,799.852,801.888,And that's certainly true.
2012.12-398,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,801.888,806.106,"But I -- I just don't think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't worry about investment, it'll come."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,815.648,821.885,"And it is certainly true, as Your Honor suggests, that one of the incentives here is a process patent or a development patent."
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,826.587,827.306,"That's the whole point, isn't it?"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,832.86,833.876,That's exactly correct.
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,834.776,838.661,"And so, that is the answer, which is in isolation it has no value."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,840.563,842.965,"Interestingly, it has one value."
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,859.51,861.943,That's a failure of the patent law.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,863.545,870.533,"And it shouldn't patent ideas, and -- but it also makes the point that isolated gene and the gene in the body are the same."
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,870.533,872.835,Can we go to -- can we go to cDNA a moment?
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,872.835,873.368,Sure.
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,873.368,878.804,"That is artificially created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,904.872,909.776,There are two big differences between cDNA and DNA.
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.301,961.125,"I know, but I don't see the answer, because I gather, if I -- if I've read it correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA does not have the same base pairs."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,965.677,966.212,--Yes.
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,966.212,978.754,"So when you actually look, if you could get a super-microscope and look at what they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would discover something with an A, not a U."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,980.706,981.889,Yes.
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,981.889,982.206,Okay.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1012.625,1018.395,"Well, but I would suggest, Your Honor, that the question is not whether it is identical to something in nature."
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1024.366,1025.485,But that goes to obviousness.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1041.494,1044.696,The sequence of the nucleotides is dictated by nature.
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1047.664,1048.933,"Well, that's a separate question--"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1048.933,1049.466,It is true--
2012.12-398,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1049.466,1059.122,--about whether this claim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15 nucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1075.001,1090.343,"--It is not -- the -- the exons with the exact same composition and in the exact same order are found in nature, and the question is whether when the body removes the introns, has the body made something markedly different than what is in nature, and it is our view--"
2012.12-398,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1090.343,1099.699,"When I first looked at this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1114.043,1123.481,"--It is somewhat easier to work with cDNA to make recombinant DNA, and it's recombinant DNA that is the place where all of the innovation and all the efforts are taking place."
2012.12-398,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1124.414,1127.1,Is all the tagging done on recombinant DNA?
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1127.1,1134.872,--All of the change -- all of the useful things that we are inventing is done -- is done through the process of recombinant DNA.
2012.12-398,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1147.514,1161.689,"Mr. Hansen, you answered my initial question by saying they start -- everything starts with a national -- natural product, but these others, the examples that I gave, you said they involve manipulation."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1168.427,1176.799,"It certainly -- there's -- there is some manipulation, although it's -- it's letting nature manipulate, not doing -- not the scientist manipulating."
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.661,1203.283,Do you -- you've really lost me when you say that it's nature that does the alteration rather than the scientist.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1209.504,1210.037,No--
2012.12-398,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.037,1213.139,"I mean, he doesn't do it unnaturally, does he?"
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1214.158,1217.293,"--Well, let me try an analogy, Your Honor, that might be helpful."
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.226,1244.26,"Can I ask a question, which I don't think will be taken from your time."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1244.26,1245.21,"Sure, of course."
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1245.21,1247.045,But I have to ask you this.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1283.602,1284.504,No--
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1284.504,1286.22,Because of the word “ wherein ”.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1301.514,1302.08,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1302.08,1305.334,Is there any support for that other than the treatise that you cited?
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1305.334,1306.434,There--
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1306.434,1311.322,"I mean, I looked at that and it said read the “ wherein ” depending on context."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1311.322,1312.338,"--Well, that certainly--"
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.338,1313.855,And then depending on -- okay.
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1316.807,1317.242,--Yes.
2012.12-398,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1323.712,1324.296,"Yes, I saw that."
2012.12-398,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1324.662,1325.112,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-398,0,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,1325.112,1325.914,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1325.914,1337.805,General Verrilli?
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1337.805,1339.955,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-398,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1363.455,1364.539,Are we fighting over nothing?
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1381.299,1385.136,--I actually think that -- I think we're -- we're fighting about something of importance.
2012.12-398,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1428.947,1438.005,"Mr. Hansen -- Mr. Hansen just said that to do recombinant technology, you have to use the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated DNA."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1439.305,1442.473,"That's not my understanding, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-398,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.799,1457.016,"Well, suppose his understanding is correct."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1460.418,1474.428,"--Our position, though, is that cDNA is patent eligible because we think, unlike the isolated DNA which is just taken from your body, cDNA is an artificial creation in the laboratory that doesn't correspond to anything in your body."
2012.12-398,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1474.428,1489.453,"But Mister -- General Verrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief that your view was that, although the cDNA may be patentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1489.453,1499.459,"That's true now, Justice Ginsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that the patent is issued, so what may be true now might not have been true at the time the patents were initially issued."
2012.12-398,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1500.745,1502.445,I understand--
2012.12-398,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1502.445,1512.303,But I -- I thought the basic general approach here was we have a very expansive view of what is patent eligible and then we narrow things through things -- issues like obviousness and so on.
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1520.29,1521.659,--That's a little--
2012.12-398,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.659,1532.966,"If you got something that's big, it seems to me pretty obvious that you could take a smaller part of it; that the idea -- a smaller part of something that's bigger is obvious."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1546.44,1595.587,"--Well, I think my answer to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the threshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty test and a specification test do not do; and the work that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly, because if it can be deemed to be a human invention solely as a result of the change that occurs when you extract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a practical matter that you have granted a patent on the gene itself because no one else can extract it because extracting it is isolating it; isolating it violates the patent."
2012.12-398,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.71,1604.66,I'm -- I'm not sure that's responsive to my concern.
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1616.767,1632.712,"Well, the Court identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the eligibility stage, because the -- because getting the balance right is of critical importance."
2012.12-398,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1632.712,1634.862,"Well, the issue here is a very difficult one."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1639.133,1640.033,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1640.033,1643.402,It seems that there is disagreement within the Executive Branch about it.
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1692.25,1703.242,"Well, I would -- again, I would point the Court to what the Court said last term in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent eligibility really is a double-edged sword."
2012.12-398,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.774,1735.529,"General Verrilli, there's an assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United States would be in a singular position."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1747.587,1749.687,"Yes, and that--"
2012.12-398,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1749.687,1750.373,Is that so?
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1750.373,1751.139,--No.
2012.12-398,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1804.791,1809.162,--I understand why you are saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter.
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1842.383,1846.251,"--Your Honor, as a -- I am going to invoke my privilege as an amicus in this situation."
2012.12-398,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.69,1856.475,So you are not taking the position that this claim as written is patentable?
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1856.475,1856.958,"That's right, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1864.296,1869.533,"Because as I understand it, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1873.068,1874.937,"That -- that may well be right, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1931.254,1936.325,"General Verrilli, could I understand what you said, because I think it might be a little bit different from Mr. Hansen and I just want to understand your position."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1956.972,1958.421,"May I answer briefly, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2012.12-398,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1958.421,1959.09,"Briefly, please."
2012.12-398,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1959.09,1962.792,"Yes, you certainly can, and that illustrates the difference."
2012.12-398,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1968.412,1968.946,"Thank you, General."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,1977.635,1979.754,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2000.417,2003.369,Is that on the basis of a new extraction process?
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2003.369,2005.252,"On a -- a new extraction process, no."
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2023.347,2029.318,I -- I have a sort of analytical problem.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2069.395,2071.014,"Well, I guess I'll--"
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2071.014,2073.73,How do you add to it besides process or use?
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2073.73,2074.216,--Sure.
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2114.941,2115.626,"Look, I can bake--"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2115.626,2116.509,--is what was defined.
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2116.509,2127.516,"--I can bake a chocolate chip cookie using natural ingredients -- salt, flour, eggs, butter -- and I create my chocolate chip cookie."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2149.197,2149.83,And that's--
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2149.83,2150.966,Explain to me--
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2150.966,2151.582,--Sure.
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2151.582,2162.773,"--why gene sequences, whether in the actual numbers, why gene sequences are not those basic products that you can't patent."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2162.773,2163.273,Okay.
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2171.962,2172.445,That's the cDNA.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2172.445,2173.712,"--No, no, no."
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2185.12,2186.07,"So I put salt and flour, and that's different?"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2186.07,2192.876,"Well, that is -- that is the combination, yes, of two different things, and that's sort of like -- that's sort of like--"
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2192.876,2197.947,"So if I take them apart, now you can get a patent on the salt and now you can get a patent on the flour?"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2197.947,2200.563,"--Well, they were apart before, but they were both old."
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2208.052,2208.902,"Well, I guess--"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2208.902,2210.17,--like leaves and that sort of thing.
2012.12-398,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2210.17,2212.237,Why is the chemical composition in the isolated DNA different?
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2213.706,2216.758,"Yes, thank you, Justice Alito."
2012.12-398,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.462,2252.581,"Well, well, well, well, this is something I was going to ask you."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2270.209,2276.363,--But we've -- I'll -- I'll use my own simplistic analogy which we offered in our brief and which we offered to the lower court.
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.635,2301.93,"Well, that's true, but then you were saying something that I just didn't understand, because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and it's attached to two ends."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2333.818,2335.001,"Well, I will tell you that--"
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.001,2336.418,I probably misread it.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2338.37,2340.989,"--Well, no, I think -- I think you may have read some of the submissions correctly, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.591,2344.174,"Well, which one have I not read--"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2344.174,2345.374,--I think that's a question of some dispute in this record.
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2345.374,2349.078,"--So, in other words, you're saying that the Lander brief is wrong."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2349.078,2350.911,"Well, what I will tell you--"
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.911,2358.184,"I want to know, because I have to admit that I read it and I did assume that as a matter of science it was correct."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2369.241,2372.276,--What I will tell you is that what are called pseudogenes--
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.276,2373.36,I'd like a yes or no answer.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2373.36,2373.943,--Yes.
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2377.395,2379.014,"Was the answer no, you do not disagree with it?"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2381.382,2383.918,--I do disagree with it with the following--
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2383.918,2385.101,As a matter of science.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2385.101,2386.953,--As a matter of science with the following -- okay.
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.953,2387.52,Okay.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2399.444,2404.046,You want me to tell you something from a scientist that you should read that tells you that it is wrong?
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2404.046,2404.914,"No, I need to know--"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2404.914,2409.699,"I think you could look at the declaration in the -- the Joint Appendix for Dr. Kay, for example."
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2443.457,2444.14,Can I--
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2444.14,2446.408,--mutations that are likely to result in cancer.
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2447.324,2449.526,--Can I get back to your baseball bat example?
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2449.526,2449.926,Sure.
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2449.926,2457.799,"My understanding -- my understanding is that here, what's involved, obviously through scientific processes, but we're not talking about process."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2481.665,2492.353,"Well, I -- I guess I'll even take issue with that, because the -- the story of how the SEQ ID number 2, the genomic DNA segment came about is exactly the opposite of that."
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2520.707,2521.273,Okay.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2522.24,2538.751,And then what the -- what the Myriad inventors then did to create what is called SEQ ID number 2 and what is claimed in claim 1 of the '282 patent is to take -- actually manipulate that further to add in the introns.
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2553.311,2561.467,I still don't understand what -- in what sense it's different than just snipping along -- along the line.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2561.467,2564.569,"--Well, first of all, you wouldn't even know where to snip until the Myriad invention."
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2565.902,2566.619,Okay.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2571.389,2572.439,Right.
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2572.439,2573.341,--after you've snipped it.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2573.341,2578.293,And -- and that is indeed a product of human ingenuity and that has substantial new uses.
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2580.078,2596.873,"Mr. Castanias, go back to Justice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right, because it takes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually find that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on the genetic material."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2605.896,2613.982,"--The plant itself, I think not, Justice Kagan, but I think the question that was -- that was posed was whether I could take an extract from that plant."
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2613.982,2617.953,"Well, but can you patent the thing itself?"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2617.953,2622.505,"The thing itself I would -- in that hypothetical, I would say the answer is no."
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2622.505,2625.024,Even though you know you have to extract the plant itself--
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2625.024,2625.69,It's a lot of--
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2625.69,2626.309,--from the Amazon forest.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2626.309,2627.859,"--Ah, but you see, now you're adding the manipulation--"
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2627.859,2630.428,"I'm not -- I mean, I don't know what manipulation means."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2632.963,2633.663,--Okay.
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2633.663,2636.165,And carry it away and isolate it.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2643.236,2646.121,"Well, what I -- what I haven't done is isolated a new thing."
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2677.742,2681.111,"Well, the plant in the forest can't be used for any purpose either."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2698.422,2700.607,"Well, I think there are two ways -- two ways to look at that."
2012.12-398,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2771.87,2787.63,"But when you -- when you isolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as a probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals that make it a probe."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2787.63,2788.665,"--As a probe, that's true."
2012.12-398,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2790.182,2798.021,"So it seemed to me your -- your answer was not quite accurate when you said, well, it can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2800.806,2802.04,"Well, since this Court -- I'm sorry."
2012.12-398,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2802.04,2805.675,"Now, if it's -- if it's the process or the additions that make it patentable, fine."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2812.613,2815.899,"Well, I -- I will say that that is the final inventive act."
2012.12-398,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2821.1,2821.7,Do you concede--
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2821.7,2822.469,--I'm sorry.
2012.12-398,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2822.469,2837.912,"--Do you concede at least that the decision in the Federal Circuit, that Judge Lourie did make an incorrect assumption, or is the Lander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too?"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2849.869,2860.611,"No, what -- I think Justice -- Judge Lourie was exactly correct to say that there is nothing in this record that says that isolated DNA fragments of BRCA1 exist in the body."
2012.12-398,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2876.787,2878.223,But isn't this just a question of probability?
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,2907.54,2911.86,"--That's pretty much the same as what he's talking about, is that there might be something that was out there somewhere."
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.417,2924.251,--All right.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3031.973,3032.556,Well--
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.556,3037.627,"And I would like you to express your view on that, because that's the framework that I am bringing to the case."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3037.627,3039.293,"--I -- I will offer the view, Justice Breyer:"
2012.12-398,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3159.239,3164.976,"--Even though -- even though the Government has disavowed it, even though the Government, representing the United States--"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3164.976,3167.927,"--Even so, and -- and the reason for that is--"
2012.12-398,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3167.927,3173.765,--At least that the strength of the presumption would be diluted.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3173.765,3189.425,"--I think you can dilute it a little bit, but you can't take away the fact that it is a 30-plus year practice that the Patent Office, despite the executive's position in this Court and in the Federal Circuit, continues to follow."
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3189.425,3196.762,"Mr. Castanias, could I take you away from the deference point and just ask again about the -- the kind of law that you would have us make."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3202.833,3216.758,"I think in theory that is possible, but I should say this: Because this case is about Section 101, I'm trying -- I'm answering your question as though it's about 101, patent eligibility."
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3216.758,3217.208,Yes.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3217.208,3219.694,"Would it be obvious, would it be novel?"
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3222.829,3223.262,Right.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3223.262,3227.05,"But would it -- and I think really, the -- the statute does the work here."
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3230.085,3230.852,But the first--
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3230.852,3231.835,--if it had use.
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3235.204,3243.076,"--I'm sorry, because -- because -- because, like Justice Breyer, I consider uses -- patents on uses in a different category."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3247.463,3252.681,"Again, I -- I perhaps am not making myself as clear as I should."
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3262.139,3262.623,Yes.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3263.639,3264.373,--in any case.
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3265.258,3271.329,"The first person who found a chromosome and isolated it, I think we can all say that that was a very useful discovery."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3281.268,3281.951,If they -- if--
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3281.951,3290.123,"And the PTO seems very patent happy, so could, you know, would -- would they have had a good patentability argument?"
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3290.123,3300.848,"--I think if -- to get through the Section 101 gateway, if that chromosome had a specific substantial and credible utility, in other words, it could be used in some--"
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3300.848,3301.814,"Yes, of course it does."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3301.814,3306.668,"--diagnostic way in the way that we're talking about here, then yes, it would pass through the Section 101 gate."
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3311.287,3311.904,Would -- would -- okay.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3311.904,3312.656,And then there's the further--
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3312.656,3313.122,And that's interesting--
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3313.122,3313.606,--Sure.
2012.12-398,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3313.606,3319.143,"--because then it's not a question about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds or whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3340.139,3353.483,"I -- I think -- I think, Justice Kagan, you're really putting your finger on the problem with this, again, I -- I keep wanting to refer to as the so-called Product of Nature Doctrine because I don't believe that as a separate doctrine it really exists."
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3374.146,3376.746,You are saying it gets past 101.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3376.746,3377.931,--Even if it gets through the 101--
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3377.931,3379.748,"Well, that's -- that's the problem."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3385.954,3386.77,--No.
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3386.77,3388.504,And it gets through 101?
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3393.708,3394.158,Okay.
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3413.687,3419.758,--But you're not suggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a piece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece patentable.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3419.758,3420.125,--No.
2012.12-398,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3421.543,3422.077,So what's the difference?
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3432.149,3462.335,"I would say that -- I would say that under -- under your existing decisions in Chakrabarty, J.E.M., that set forth a broad understanding of Section 101 and an understanding of what is within the limited exception, then what -- I -- I would -- I mean, honestly, I think that Section 103 does this work better than Section 101, but to the point of Section 101, there's -- there is nothing different about that piece in the body."
2012.12-398,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3462.335,3462.704,Ah.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3505.114,3511.701,"And I think, Justice Breyer, there is where I've -- I've tried to explain to you about the different functions, the different values."
2012.12-398,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3528.08,3541.62,"Well, we could have said that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the patent was that we have a uniform rule for all industries."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3541.62,3542.237,"Right, but in--"
2012.12-398,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3542.237,3548.31,"And -- and that avoids giving special industries special subsidies, which is very important it seems to me."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3572.675,3580.512,--The -- the problem of making that decision now is that so much has happened since these gene patents issued and since the utility guidelines.
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3754.826,3760.48,"Well, I don't understand how this is at all like that, because there you're obviously combining things and getting something new."
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3769.871,3779.476,"Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I -- the discussion we had earlier, the -- in -- in fact, the sequence that's claimed in Claim 1 of the '282 patent was not created by snipping."
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3781.845,3782.312,Sure.
2012.12-398,2,25131,gregory_a_castanias,,3782.312,3791.701,Only once it was created can a scientist ever know how and where to make the decision to snip.
2012.12-398,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3792.418,3792.984,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3795.153,3797.772,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3797.772,3808.58,Is there some value to us striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA?
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3815.65,3829.743,"Of -- of course there would be value in that in the sense that -- that, A, it reinforces the Product of Nature Doctrine, but more importantly, the effect of the patents in this case allows Myriad to stop all research on a part of the human body."
2012.12-398,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3841.901,3849.288,"Now, how do you understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA?"
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3871.486,3879.759,"Well, and yes, I -- I agree, Your Honor, that he was focusing on Claims 5 and 6, which are the ones that include 15 nucleotides or -- or longer."
2012.12-398,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3879.759,3881.492,"Now, I'm making your job harder."
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3886.846,3888.448,"Well, all--"
2012.12-398,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3888.448,3897.138,"So assuming we believe that there is some human invention in this process; whether it's obvious or not, separate question."
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3910.628,3911.397,--Well--
2012.12-398,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3911.397,3915.782,I know you are helping your adversary by answering this question.
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3915.782,3916.849,"--That's fine, Your Honor."
2012.12-398,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3927.823,3929.192,I am putting that aside.
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3929.192,3938.964,I think by saying that when genes are transformed in such a way that the scientist decides their sequence rather than the nature deciding their sequence--
2012.12-398,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3938.964,3942.666,"Only if they do a recombinant DNA, that's what you are saying."
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3942.666,3943.132,"--Right, right."
2012.12-398,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3990.48,3992.515,Why don't you take another minute.
2012.12-398,3,19169,christopher_a_hansen,,3995.817,4004.323,"Well, I guess the only other thing I would say, Your Honor, is to respond to what I may have left a misimpression with Justice Kagan's questions."
2012.12-398,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4019.183,4020.533,"Thank you, counsel."
