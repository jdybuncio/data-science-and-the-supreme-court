1977.77-285,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.394,We will hear arguments next in California against the United States.
1977.77-285,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,37.093,40.374,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1977.77-285,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.899,323.077,Was the phrase “Congressional authorized purpose of the project” one gotten out of the legal literature or used by the State of California or by the United States?
1977.77-285,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,323.077,326.477,"It reflects the position of the United States, Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-285,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.607,370.653,"Well, what if Congress said “we want to have the New Melones Project and we are going to appropriate all vested water rights in the State of California that are inconsistent with the operation of that.”"
1977.77-285,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,375.959,377.388,"Yes, very definitely."
1977.77-285,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.388,380.497,Consistently with the Gerlach Live Stock case?
1977.77-285,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,380.497,381.28,Yes.
1977.77-285,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.222,398.982,What power do you suppose it would be exercising if it did that?
1977.77-285,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,398.982,404.511,I think that it would have that power under either the commerce clause or the property clause of the United States Constitution.
1977.77-285,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.139,421.213,What subsequent cases have suggested that it does have that power?
1977.77-285,0,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,421.213,436.862,"We think that a fair analysis of this Court’s decisions in Ivanhoe and Fresno would support the concept that Congress has that its constitutional power because, in those cases, the Court essentially held that Congress could override state water laws in specific areas."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,2483.017,2486.56,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2676.801,2682.79,"The Court of Appeals came out about 100% opposite from this Court in Hancock v. Train, did it not?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,2692.991,2703.153,"There is an apparent anomaly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but in any event, we do not think it makes any difference here since we did in this case apply to the State Board for our permits."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2798.186,2809.637,"Mr. Barnett, in the District Court or in the Court of Appeal, did you take the position as you do here that one must study the 25 conditions to decide whether the state can impose any conditions or not?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,2809.637,2817.192,We took the position in both courts that the state had no right to impose any conditions.
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.031,2836.821,"But if you still maintain that they have no power to impose any conditions, why do we have to study the 25 conditions?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,2836.821,2842.393,"For two reasons, one is that the Court might not agree with us and we might therefore --"
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2842.393,2846.528,"But you are going to the conditions without even arguing the first point, that is why I was puzzled about it."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,2846.528,2853.86,The other reason is that I think you have to look at the conditions to show why the state should have no power to impose any of them.
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2928.432,2936.814,"Mr. Barnett, is it the government’s position that it will own the 2.5 million square-feet of water that is stored behind the dam?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,2936.814,2941.742,"That it will own the water, no that is not our position."
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2952.951,2953.911,It is never answered.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,2953.911,2957.585,It has never answered the question of who owns unappropriated water.
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.194,2993.438,"But you could, for instance, decide that that water should be used for irrigation and sell it to people who wanted to use it for irrigation even though, under California law, domestic use took higher priority and if that law prevailed, they could not use it here?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,2993.438,2997.055,"That would be our position, but that is not because we own the water."
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3005.779,3012.744,"Yet, it is appropriated, you say, it is not bought, it is not condemned?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3012.744,3014.568,"No, because it was not owned."
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.568,3032.084,"Because it was not owned and, yet, it is simply somehow transmogrified by the existence of this project into something that is made available to people in California under a system of law that is not consistent with California’s?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3032.084,3041.21,"That is true and that system of law arises, the law of this project arises from the Acts of Congress authorizing the project."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.21,3065.726,"I take it then you would think that Congress could constitutionally pass an Act that says “we know the western states have been managing the appropriation of waters, but we are going to have a national system to appropriate the waters from all of the unappropriated water that exist in western streams."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3073.429,3077.241,Congress would pay just compensation for those?
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3077.241,3078.231,Unappropriated water.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3078.231,3079.942,Unappropriated waters?
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.338,3084.771,"In a sense, that is what you are saying."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3090.792,3094.037,"Yes, I think that is correct."
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.037,3096.689,What power is it acting under when it does that?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3096.689,3104.433,I think it is clear from cases like Ivanhoe that the power to spend for the general welfare and the property clause are two powers.
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.433,3107.827,It has not spent any money buying these water rights though.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3107.827,3112.077,"It is not buying the water rights, but it is buying the dam."
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3115.521,3119.08,Take the example of California Homesteading project.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3133.821,3138.429,"It may have to pay for it, but here we have got unappropriated water which is not owned."
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3193.277,3199.194,Which you will enter with third parties for their actual use?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3199.194,3203.505,"Yes, depending on the purposes of the particular authorizing Act."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3493.537,3495.803,What do you understand to be their reason for that?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3495.803,3499.823,"They give their reasons, Mr. Justice White, in their opinion."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.134,3525.954,"Yes, but what about the project?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3531.419,3535.965,"That, in fact, is a reason that petitioners come up within their briefs."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3552.618,3554.087,That is what I thought.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3554.087,3575.642,"And it was on that basis that they say “since he does not have a plan for consumptive use of the water, we will not allow any water for consumptive use especially since if we allow the water for consumptive use that would fill the reservoir and that would wipe out the white water rafting.”"
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3575.642,3577.804,What is wrong with that reason for denying the permit?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3577.804,3579.762,There are several things wrong with that reason.
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3586.324,3589.328,"Well, suppose he did not?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3589.328,3598.319,"Even if he did not, we would submit that it is not up to the State Board to trench on the authority that Congress has given the Secretary."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3610.933,3618.247,"That may be the remedy, but what is wrong with the Board saying “you have exceeded your authority."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3625.431,3634.135,"Perhaps it would not be, but the Board here has not taken the position that the Secretary was acting beyond his Congressional authority."
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3668.754,3670.706,"Why is that, because of Congress?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3670.706,3673.747,"That is what the Act says, the 1962 Act, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3691.118,3695.498,How did he even know how much to ask for?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3695.498,3708.498,"Congress authorized, on the basis of the project document, a reservoir of 2.4 million acre-feet on the basis of projected needs, both within the Basin and outside of it on the basis of projected needs."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3708.498,3714.224,A part of that projected need is something that Congress has not appropriated the money for?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3714.224,3721.048,"No, Congress has appropriated the money for the dam."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3721.048,3725.372,What is the project that your colleagues have referred to that has washed out?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3725.372,3729.226,That is the east side division that they refer to in their brief.
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3751.028,3753.041,Is that outside the watershed?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3753.698,3773.017,"That would bring water outside the Stanislaus River Basin, that is true, but that was only one contemplated way of bringing water outside the Stanislaus River Basin to the service areas of the Central Valley Project."
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3877.963,3882.013,Or around its consumptive purposes which have not been decided upon?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3882.013,3886.724,But the Secretary is in the process of deciding them after he defines the need --
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3886.724,3890.29,He just trying to (Inaudible)
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3890.29,3913.464,"Further, the condition one by limiting the size of the reservoir because the water cannot be stored for consumptive purposes, the size of the reservoir would be only 1.1 million acre-feet, not 2.4 million, there is a tremendous impact on the power that can be generated by the project and power is also one of the admitted purposes of the Act."
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3913.464,3922.731,"I know it would never happen, but if you did build a reservoir and dam that was too big, you could make it smaller."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3922.731,3930.143,"That is true, but it seems unlikely in California or in the country that there will be a lack --"
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3930.143,3939.35,But do you not think California was right to say “what are you going to do with this water?”
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3939.35,3949.485,The Act says that the Secretary is to determine the needs of the Basin and then to determine where to sell the water.
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3972.933,3973.445,Mr. Barnett?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3973.445,3974.31,Yes?
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3974.31,3980.306,"I think you said, in substance, that the conditions are the heart of this case."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3989.765,4003.1,"As I said before, I think what these conditions provide is relevant to see why it should be the law that California has no authority to impose any conditions."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4013.434,4020.341,Do you think the United States government is required to seek a permit from California?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4020.341,4023.178,"As I said at the outset, we do not contest that in this case."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4023.978,4025.429,Why not?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4025.429,4035.709,"Because the Court of Appeals so ruled, because we make it a practice to seek such a permit because it serves legitimate federalism functions of informing the state of what we are doing."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4035.709,4039.634,"As a matter of power, what would your answer be?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4039.634,4043.895,"As a matter of power, for purposes of this case, we concede that we are compelled to."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4056.958,4063.042,I suppose the California Board determines whether or not there is sufficient unappropriated water?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4063.042,4068.272,"Yes and the Board so determined here, as I read, that there is sufficient unappropriated water."
1977.77-285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4100.971,4104.886,That takes us back to when I suggested in a question at the outset.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4126.916,4128.109,I think that is correct.
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4146.618,4165.752,What if the California legislature were to next week to pass a law declaring that all unappropriated water in the state is hereby appropriated to beneficial users who will be determined by a commission appointed by the governor on the basis of existing California water law?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4165.752,4179.635,"That sounds as though that might pose the question that this Court has avoided deciding since the Dessert Land Act of 1877, that is, whether by that Act the federal government did give ownership of all unappropriated water to the states or not."
1977.77-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4179.635,4186.84,"There is no question that Massachusetts owns the unappropriated waters in its streams, is there?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4186.84,4193.457,"Massachusetts has a Riparian Rights Doctrine and I do not know the answer to that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4193.457,4216.991,"Mr. Barnett, could you put a finger on a second or two on what you think it is that gives California or any of the other appropriation states the right to have a system of water law under which people can have their appropriations validated and acquire property rights?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4216.991,4226.802,"I think it is a stream of federal legislation beginning with the Mining Act of 1966, including the Dessert Land Act of 1877 and including the Reclamation Act of 1902."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4245.016,4250.397,Those Acts depended for their effect on the existence of public land in those states.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4265.141,4272.764,"I suppose not, and I simply cannot answer the question as to who owns the flowing water in Massachusetts, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4353.097,4357.187,"I think petitioner would say if your facts are right, you would agree the condition is improper?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4357.187,4359.031,"No, they certainly do not take that position."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4359.031,4366.529,"I thought he said that if the condition would interfere with the Congressional determination of what the statute is supposed to accomplish, the state had no power to hold it?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4366.529,4381.23,"No, I think we could ask him, but I think they would take the position that since Congress did not specifically say “we want $5 million worth of power a year” that this does not conflict with the specific Congressional purpose, but that is the kind of argument that the courts would be in."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4383.638,4401.123,"Turning it around just a moment, I understood part of their reasoning to be that while you have got a lot of other water in this overall project and so you do not need this specific source for the time being at least for consumptive purposes, if they were right factually, would they not be right legally also?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4401.123,4417.033,"I do not think so because Congress, one of the specific provisions of the 1962 authorizing Act written into the Act is that the New Melones Project shall become an integral part of the Central Valley Project and shall be operated as such by the Secretary of the Interior."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4460.564,4468.569,"But if it is an integrated project and if the total project has enough water for those four counties, why is this condition an objection?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4468.569,4474.615,"If Congress thought that the total project had enough water available, it would not authorize this project."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4474.615,4479.448,"I think it is a temporary thing, was it not? Did they not say, for the time being?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4479.448,4482.601,What the 1962 Act says --
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4482.601,4485.361,I meant that some of the conditions were temporary?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4485.361,4490.376,They are all temporary in that they are subject to further order of the Board.
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4656.003,4662.977,"Mr. Barnett, would this only apply to California, this dam?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4662.977,4665.482,This dam is only in California.
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4668.1,4674.725,Where does a federal government get the right to build a dam in the middle of a state without the state’s cooperation?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4674.725,4679.45,"First of all, it gets the right from the constitution, as has been held in Ivanhoe and other cases."
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4690.932,4702.934,"Could Congress, I would assume your answer would be yes, cut off the water for three other states and leave it all in one state?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4705.063,4719.042,"No, I think Section 8 of the 1902 Act would prevent that where it provides that nothing in the Act can impair the rights of another state or an interstate river."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4719.042,4726.384,"I take it you think that this Court has already, two or three times, construed Section 8 the way you think it should be construed."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4726.384,4727.112,I do.
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4765.393,4771.142,"To get back to my other question, and take out the two states."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4786.545,4792.837,"The reality of these things, Mr. Justice Marshall, is these projects do not get constructed by Congress unless the state supports them."
1977.77-285,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4798.855,4810.282,"Waht I am -- All I am trying to get to is we have gotten along fine up to now by cooperating, state and federal. Do we not have to get back to that?"
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4810.282,4816.396,We contend that that is where we are and that it is California that is trying to upset the balance.
1977.77-285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4816.396,4818.512,Does it not come down to this?
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,4828.512,4839.769,"When we disagree about the operation or the uses of a federal reclamation project, under the present federal reclamation law, yes, that is our position."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4988.257,4990.02,"Mr. Barnett, can I ask one other question."
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,5000.316,5002.022,I think there was an amendment to the compliant.
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5002.022,5007.442,I am sorry.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,5012.233,5014.639,"Yes, which are not specifically authorized."
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5020.915,5021.872,I see
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,5029.331,5033.061,We would submit that that is a terrible burden to impose on Trial Judges.
1977.77-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5035.178,5039.722,But you told us to study all 25 conditions in order to decide what the law is.
1977.77-285,1,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,5041.787,5047.232,It might be easier here in a sense that we have tried to take the burden that the Trial Judge did not take.
1977.77-285,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5108.812,5109.316,Very well.
1977.77-285,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,5118.612,5123.832,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5229.467,5237.63,To hold for you that we have to disembowel Arizona v. California to some extent and Ivanhoe?
1977.77-285,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,5237.63,5239.444,"No, not at all, Justice White."
1977.77-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5273.286,5274.719,What about Ivanhoe?
1977.77-285,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,5274.719,5287.834,"In Ivanhoe and Fresno, the Court, as we view the Court’s decisions, merely held that states could not override specific Congressional policies that had been established by Congress either in the Reclamation Act of 1902 or in later Acts."
1977.77-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5287.834,5290.68,But they did say something about Section 8 specifically.
1977.77-285,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,5292.41,5296.861,"There was some certain language that appeared in those decisions that was strictly dictum, Justice White."
1977.77-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5296.861,5298.689,"I know, but do you disagree with them?"
1977.77-285,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,5298.689,5304.268,"If that dictum is construed against the position we are advocating, we certainly disagree with it."
1977.77-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5323.506,5329.008,Was the 160-acre limitation written in by Congress under the 1902 Reclamation Act?
1977.77-285,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,5329.008,5332.55,"Yes, it was."
1977.77-285,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5458.905,5466.571,"With respect to the interstate problem, I want to be sure I understand your position. That does not exist in this case. This is all in the intrastate, I presume it, but many would be --"
1977.77-285,2,40828,roderick_eugene_walston,,5466.571,5467.568,That is correct.
1977.77-285,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5484.049,5484.691,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
