1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,66.745,"Mr. Lazarus, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,66.745,69.836,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,260.666,262.136,What did they indicate?
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,262.136,264.549,That they declined to initially process the charge.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.549,265.439,Is that all they said?
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,265.439,268.501,That's all it said on that form.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,268.501,273.485,"But didn't they simultaneously say they postponed, or might consider it later, or something like that?"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,278.3,280.901,"Well, pursuant to the work-sharing agreement, they reserved the jurisdiction--"
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,280.901,282.641,They reserved jurisdiction; that was their language?
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,288.568,288.915,--Precisely.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,316.445,317.434,And there had been no termination.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,317.434,322.64,They both rejected our contention that there had been a termination prior to that.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.64,327.762,"And you say that there is a termination, even though the case is going to go back to that State Commission?"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,327.762,337.008,"We say there is a termination even though the state agency has nominally reserved jurisdiction, if it wants, to act after the EEOC has acted."
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.839,340.001,And it happens sometimes that that occurs.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,340.001,350.359,"--The state agency has informed us, and I believe it's also reflected in their amicus brief filed, that four or five times a year they reactivate a charge."
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.922,354.512,Even though it's been terminated?
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,354.512,360.426,"--Because the termination does not require, we believe, a complete surrender, and there is really no reason that it should."
1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.426,365.91,"Well, ordinarily, ""termination"" means ""end"", doesn't it?"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,365.91,373.216,"Well, the word ""termination""... and that's where we disagree with Respondent... we don't believe that ""end"" must be a permanent--"
1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.216,375.888,"""Terminus"" is a Latin word that means ""end""."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,375.888,380.713,"--It means the end, but it does not necessarily mean that it be irrevocable, and it be final."
1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.004,384.696,Something can have many ends.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,384.696,387.258,"Well, it depends on what is being terminated."
1987.86-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.258,390.199,I know a lot of terminal patients who will be delighted to hear this.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,390.8,391.15,Precisely that.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.949,408.821,"Well, like a play, it can come on the next night."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,408.821,410.203,"Well, that's right."
1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.203,415.877,"But when something ceases temporarily, you ordinarily would say it's ""suspended""."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,418.007,418.238,That is right.
1987.86-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.992,433.684,It sounds like it didn't even terminate.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,435.505,436.917,"--Well, it did commence."
1987.86-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.917,438.275,How did it commence?
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,440.596,443.408,But they declined to initially process the charge.
1987.86-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.408,444.68,They didn't even process it.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,446.951,447.713,But it was filed with them.
1987.86-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.109,554.168,"Well, what the Respondents say to that, I think, is that you can read the legislative history to suggest that Congress was worried about the federal government doing too much of these things."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,561.584,564.498,"Well, we think there is no question that Congress hoped to--"
1987.86-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.498,570.879,"You say this is very harmonious, but under it the federal government's doing an awful lot of the processing rather than the states."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,570.879,578.546,"--To the extent that the federal government is doing some of the processing, it is pursuant to the agreement that the states have the upper hand in voluntarily entering into these agreements."
1987.86-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.287,586.721,"But Congress may have been worried about that, about the states themselves wanting to push as much of the work as possible onto the federal government."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,594.457,601.132,"--The statute really reflects that Congress chose to encourage the states by a carrot, and not by a stick."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.028,701.592,"But Mr. Lazarus, wasn't there another policy consideration that was quite important in this whole scheme of timing?"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,707.907,714.962,"--They wanted them to process promptly, but in this case they extended the limitations period in order to--"
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.962,716.164,--give them an opportunity to--
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,716.164,717.854,--give the state agencies their chance.
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,717.854,718.004,--Yes.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,726.63,727.281,That's right.
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,727.281,733.504,"It was referred by the EEOC, and after the state's statute of limitations had expired."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,733.504,734.005,That's right.
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,738.469,739.39,It sure does.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,741.19,742.032,"--Yes, I will."
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.661,759.826,Do all fifty states have state agencies that qualify?
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,759.826,763.048,--I believe there are a handful... four or five that do not.
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,763.048,763.749,That still do not?
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,763.749,764.57,"Right, that still do not."
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,764.57,777.009,"Well, the effect of your position is for all the states that do to convert the 180-day time limit, plus the sixty days, into a 300-day time limit."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,778.671,785.646,"Well, unless the state agency terminates the proceedings prior to the 270 days, in which case it would be the thirty days--"
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,785.646,788.177,But that's what you're really asking us to do.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,794.354,798.257,"--No, Congress has gotten exactly what they wanted."
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,812.039,819.342,"It depends on how you interpret the language of a state agency... what do they say... ""with the authority""?"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,819.342,819.472,--Right.
1987.86-1696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,828.329,829.419,Authorized to remedy.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,833.212,835.443,"Well, yes, there was."
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.443,839.807,You mean that the agency can just waive the time limit if it wants to?
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,839.807,850.384,"Well, as the Court of Appeals concluded, and we don't resist that conclusion here, the state limitations period is not self-executing, and it is subject to waiver."
1987.86-1696,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,871.219,873.791,"Well, it certainly isn't always black and white, either, is it?"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,873.791,875.123,As it isn't in this case.
1987.86-1696,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,885.789,891.764,There is certainly something to be said for your argument that you don't want a federal agency to be deciding these state-law questions.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,891.764,891.954,--That's right.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.332,940.47,"Do you think Congress really anticipated that the state agency could, just in any case that was referred to it or filed with it, say,"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,947.512,951.656,Congress did not purport to dictate what states decided to do.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.478,964.075,I thought that Congress really wanted to really refer the states to process these cases first.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,964.075,967.067,They wanted two things.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.614,1040.738,"But if that's such a rare case, why don't they simply terminate the proceeding?"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1040.738,1044.662,Because they believe it is important to take care of that rare case.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.009,1061.511,"And they're protecting their jurisdiction by saying,"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1067.796,1070.137,--You investigate it first when you receive it first.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.579,1073.65,That's not the scheme Congress created.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1073.65,1075.83,"--Well, it gives the states the option."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.512,1090.882,"No, but it said,"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1095.946,1098.236,"--Well, that's where we disagree."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.236,1099.598,"Thats the issue, I suppose, in the case."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1099.598,1106.674,We said that you were given the opportunity to act first and to process the charge first.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.167,1114.751,"Not only an opportunity, but it's an opportunity that makes the federal government wait until after they have terminated what they're doing."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1114.751,1115.131,"--Right, but--"
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.131,1117.303,"And what you're saying is that they really meant to say,"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1121.046,1124.859,--If the states... and the states have the authority... and that's what Congress gave them.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.293,1143.581,"But then you're saying that all of that extra time that was being given in order for the state to do whatever it thought was necessary in order to terminate the proceeding in the way the statute literally reads, you're going to get that time anyway."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1143.581,1144.573,"Well, that's not--"
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.573,1149.605,Even though the state is doing nothing but receiving the form and sending it back after checking off a box.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1149.605,1149.986,--That's not precisely true.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.187,1174.688,But you're saying--
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1174.688,1182.405,The 300-day limitation period does not apply in every case.
1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.964,1206.09,"--It seems to me if Congress meant what you say it meant, it would have said that the state agency relinquishes jurisdiction over the proceedings."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1215.088,1228.608,"Well, simply, if we think the word ""terminate"" means ""to cease"", and whether a cessation necessarily is permanent and irrevocable depends on the nature of the activity being ceased."
1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.97,1258.438,"Well, when you ordinarily think of someone describing a law suit as having been terminated, you think it may just have been temporarily suspended, maybe a little continuance or a recess?"
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1259.447,1264.182,"--It could be that the District Court proceedings have been terminated, but there might be more going on in the process."
1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1279.382,1285.697,We know the result Congress was aiming for is to read the language that Congress used.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1286.939,1293.945,"--Right, but we believe that word includes an ambiguity, particularly with respect to what is being terminated."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.757,1356.358,I don't follow that.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1358.281,1364.057,--But to take advantage of what they believe is an efficient work-sharing arrangement--
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.057,1364.726,"Well, yes."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1368.81,1372.333,"--But Congress didn't, we think, preclude the states--"
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.333,1379.606,But you don't need a work-sharing agreement like this in order to give the state agency an opportunity to process the claim when it's referred to it.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1379.606,1388.622,"--That's true, but the question is whether Congress intended to preclude them from setting up this kind of arrangement, which is a very sensible and efficient way to have these things work."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1398.6,1404.253,"Again, it all boils down to what meaning one puts on the word ""terminated""."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1404.253,1418.374,"And whether one is willing, as we believe one should be to agree that there is sufficient ambiguity in the provision, particularly with respect to what it applies to... to look at the purposes in the legislative history underlying the deferral requirement."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.311,1445.836,"But the way in which it works well is that the federal agency is much busier than Congress thought it would be, and the states are much less busy."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1445.836,1449.389,--The states have tremendous back logs as well.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.807,1462.13,I'm not asking who has the longest back log.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1469.443,1470.695,"Well, they're sharing work."
1987.86-1696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.031,1484.476,"This cooperative arrangement would work just as efficiently if we interpreted ""terminate"" to mean ""terminate"" the way it means ""terminate"" normally."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1517.407,1525.903,"--It's really just a game of words with the state, as a matter of state law: whether they call it a relinquishment of jurisdiction or whether they call it a reopening."
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.619,1542.776,This is just an argument that the statute of limitations should be extended.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1548.38,1560.707,The issue that we're really talking about is whether on Section 706(c) the state has to completely abdicate authority in order to terminate.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.81,1572.686,"The only reason is that there's a filing, there's a reference to the state after 240 days."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1572.686,1579.021,"--The implications in this case, given the facts, is that the charge would in fact be rendered untimely and not meet the 300 days."
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.765,1617.068,The result couldn't have happened if Plaintiff had filed with the EEOC soon enough.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1617.068,1618.791,That is always true.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.791,1620.23,"Well, exactly."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1620.891,1623.062,"If they filed it after the second day, there would be no problem."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.062,1623.743,Of course.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1626.284,1628.616,"Not under Respondent's view, of course."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.262,1640.185,"Well, under the Court of Appeals rationale."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1640.185,1640.723,--That's right.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.723,1643.007,"If they had filed under 240 days, they would have been okay."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1643.007,1643.956,But then we wouldn't be here.
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1643.956,1645.188,Exactly.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1645.188,1645.399,"The question, though--"
1987.86-1696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.399,1646.581,That's right.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1646.581,1647.623,--is what if they don't?
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.623,1652.077,"The whole point, in other words, is to be sure they have it at a period longer than 240 days."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1652.077,1655.66,"And when the Congress provides for 300 days, as we believe they have done--"
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.66,1657.523,Subject to the 60-day condition.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1657.523,1661.243,--Congress didn't write a statute which said that everything after 240 is untimely.
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.606,1669.32,"But they have a limited exception, and that is when the proceeding is earlier terminated by the states."
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1672.162,1673.952,"--Well, we don't think."
1987.86-1696,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.952,1677.605,The first general rule is 180 days.
1987.86-1696,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1685.672,1692.057,"If the Court permits, I would like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal."
1987.86-1696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.057,1694.088,"Thank you, Mr. Lazarus."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1696.509,1707.047,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1794.353,1797.435,"Well, you had a dissent on the Tenth Circuit, didn't you?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1797.435,1797.976,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1797.976,1801.278,"Which would be indicative of ambiguity, wouldn't it?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1801.278,1803.088,Justice--
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1803.088,1805.932,Judge McKay.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1805.932,1811.075,--Judge McKay did believe that the statute might have been ambiguous.
1987.86-1696,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1901.286,1908.76,"Counsel, strictly on words, could you reopen something that had been terminated?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1908.76,1910.082,"I don't believe you can, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1910.082,1914.005,"Well, isn't that why you say ""reopen""?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1914.005,1915.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1915.886,1917.425,It's because it has been terminated.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1917.425,1918.046,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1918.046,1920.908,So the two can happen together.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1920.908,1922.049,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1922.049,1925.052,Let me give you an example right here in this Court.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1948.711,1950.271,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1950.271,1954.175,Does that mean that the case did not terminate before?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1954.175,1958.228,I think the case terminated before.
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1958.228,1961.497,So do I.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1972.428,1973.398,"No, no Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1974.619,1975.791,You can't recommence something that's been terminated?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1975.791,1983.055,"--I think when something is terminated, it comes to a completion or an ending."
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.055,1985.118,And you can't start it up again?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,1985.118,1986.828,I don't believe you can.
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.367,2028.339,Then I guess none of these states ever terminate any of their proceedings.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2039.699,2040.109,"Well, Your Honor--"
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.109,2045.174,"So if that's the case, then none of these proceedings is ever terminated in these states."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2045.174,2066.188,"--In those rare situations, for example, where the termination itself might have been procured by fraud, and the state agency a year or two later realizes that, because these statues are equitable in nature, the agency can go back in and reopen that type of situation."
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.188,2067.867,So you can reopen a terminated proceeding?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2067.867,2068.748,But it's--
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.748,2074.042,Why does it make so much difference to you whether you can reopen a terminated proceeding or not?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2081.828,2091.915,"--But we view it as being a different proceeding, and Petitioner claims that the state agency was going to act further."
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.573,2189.549,How could the state have done it if the charge was outside its time limits?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2189.549,2202.289,"Justice White, under our statute, the statute of limitations will not bar the processing of a charge until the respondent raises it as an affirmative defense."
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.289,2209.012,"Well, do you give up on you 180-day argument?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2209.012,2209.773,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.773,2212.015,"How do you make it, then?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2212.015,2214.987,"Well, it is an alternative argument."
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.901,2233.81,"Well, there is an agency."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2233.81,2237.904,But it doesn't have authority to grant or seek relief with respect to this charge.
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.904,2238.295,Why not?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2238.295,2240.057,Because this charge was not timely.
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.057,2248.653,"Well, you just told me that unless the defendant raises it, the state can go right ahead and the agency can't."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2256.667,2257.048,Yes.
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.142,2403.209,Where is this?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2404.419,2408.663,"That is at page 27(a), Appendix H, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.663,2409.013,Appendix H.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2411.664,2414.025,It's the last box on the bottom of the form.
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.025,2417.109,"To dismiss, close."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2417.368,2448.099,"Here the Petitioner contends that the concept of initial waiver of processing, which results in a temporary cessation or suspension state proceedings, is the equivalent of termination, and relies on a First Circuit opinion, Isaac v. Harvard University."
1987.86-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.916,2530.552,"Well, it doesn't seem to me that the government's position here denies to the State of Colorado anything it wanted in this situation."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2548.334,2562.424,"Well, they were concerned, Your Honor, with the fact that the state agency would be free to act without federal intervention, and that the federal government would be prohibited from acting during this deferral period."
1987.86-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2573.625,2578.537,"Unless, in your view, the state actually dismisses it, or resolves it on the merits."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2578.537,2579.559,"Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.503,2602.074,"Well, that isn't quite right."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2610.582,2616.115,"--Well, I'm speaking, Your Honor, where the state initially waives processing."
1987.86-1696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.115,2617.105,"Oh, sure."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2617.105,2623.919,"Because in these situations, there is an advance waiver."
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.505,2652.531,"You mean, here this charge was filed with the EEOC 290 days after the event."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2657.822,2658.814,--That's what they say.
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.814,2659.335,How did they do it?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2659.335,2659.734,Pardon me?
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.734,2660.525,How did they do it?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2660.525,2666.729,They sent a copy of the charge with the charge transmittal form to the state agency.
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.131,2674.015,"Prior to that time, the state hadn't waived anything."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2674.015,2677.618,"--Well, under the work-sharing agreement, the state said it had waived."
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.618,2680.051,"Well, it waives as soon as it sends it back."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2680.051,2681.752,"I don't believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.203,2689.57,"Well, you mean the state couldn't have kept this proceeding and investigated it itself?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2689.57,2699.267,--They could have by notifying the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that they did not desire to go forward under their previously-agreed-to arrangement.
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2699.267,2712.804,You mean every single thing that is filed with the EEOC and referred to the state... it is assumed that the state is going to waive?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2712.804,2713.645,That's correct.
1987.86-1696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.951,2733.077,"So the only cases that the EEOC isn't going to go forward with itself, initially, is when they get a notice back that"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2735.46,2744.375,"Or if the complainant would happen to walk into the state agency as opposed to the federal agency, just by happenstance."
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2744.375,2754.282,Why does it have to be happenstance?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2757.265,2760.487,"Well, yes, I'm sure they could."
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2886.802,2889.383,"Yes, but who is going to determine that?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2889.383,2893.938,Who's going to determine if the charge is timely under state law?
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2893.938,2894.088,Yes.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2894.088,2897.4,"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can, or the state agency can."
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2897.4,2905.375,So you want a federal agency to determine timeliness under state law on every one of these claims?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2905.375,2910.2,In the situation where the extended filing period is to be allowed--
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2910.2,2912.011,It doesn't sound quite right to me.
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2925.51,2933.236,"--Well, in those situations, there might be a little more work involved."
1987.86-1696,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2937.848,2938.91,"You're going to bring him in now, too."
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2938.91,2945.923,"--I'm not thinking of your home state, Your Honor, when I mentioned it."
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.69,2981.998,"Is the effect of the sharing agreement here not only to lengthen the federal period, as you suggest, but also to lengthen the period within which the state can act?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2981.998,2983.26,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.26,2987.654,What are the limitations upon the state acting after the federal government has acted?
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,2989.366,2995.922,I guess it would depend on the situation.
1987.86-1696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.221,3017.734,"Can a state agency routinely wait for the federal government to process the charge, and then conduct its proceeding after that?"
1987.86-1696,1,33017,james_l_stone,,3017.734,3020.476,"--Not routinely, Your Honor."
1987.86-1696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.347,3082.118,"Thank you, Mr. Stone."
1987.86-1696,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3085.161,3088.421,I just have a few points on rebuttal.
1987.86-1696,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3242.08,3243.402,"Thank you, Mr. Lazarus."
