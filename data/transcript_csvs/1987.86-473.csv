1987.86-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"Cause Number 86-473, Gwaltney of Smithfield v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc.--"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,65.591,68.543,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,210.318,211.587,It had no prior knowledge?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,211.587,216.491,They did have knowledge that ITT had had problems.
1987.86-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,328.747,331.949,Is that a coined word or something?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,331.949,333.416,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.936,342.322,Is it coined for this industry or something?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,342.322,342.805,--Pardon?
1987.86-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,343.424,344.74,Was it coined for this statute?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,344.74,349.142,"No, It is my understanding it is regularly used in the industry."
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,435.184,445.139,"Mr. Prettyman, did the District Court have an alternative holding below that there were continuing violations?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,445.139,448.157,"What it had, Justice O'Connor, was--"
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.157,453.061,"I was under the impression that it did, and that that holding was just not reviewed by the Court of Appeals."
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,453.061,466.869,"--That alternative holding, which was in a footnote, was that even if you couldn't sue for past violations, that there was a good faith allegation of on-going violations."
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.123,475.142,"So, even if you were right, what, at best, what would happen?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,480.295,485.513,"--Well, if you reach that question because you don't have to reach it, of course, if you reach that question."
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.48,523.205,"Well, unless the trier of fact thought that there was, indeed, a likelihood of some continuing problem, for example, with the TKN-type discharge."
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,523.205,540.166,"In that regard, Justice O'Connor, I wonder if I could call your attention to Footnotes, I think they are, 25 and 26 of the District Court's opinion because he very well addressed those particular matters."
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.142,587.497,"Mr. Prettyman, can the EPA Administrator bring a civil penalty action for purely past violations?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,587.497,594.068,"--That is an interesting question, and we really don't know the answer to that yet."
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.853,598.872,The language is the same.
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,598.872,603.74,"--No, With great respect, Your Honor, it is not the same."
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,621.987,627.539,The Government relies on statutes outside because of the similarity of the language perhaps.
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,627.539,627.891,Right.
1987.86-473,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.516,678.574,"Mr. Prettyman, the language governing private civil actions doesn't say has violated, but it doesn't say is violating either."
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,681.876,682.809,Yes.
1987.86-473,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.809,688.696,"Now, that, it seems to me, means something quite different from is now violating."
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,709.276,717.946,"That would be very fair, Your Honor, if that's all the further we went, but the fact is that this statute, two things go to that."
1987.86-473,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.369,731.356,"But the present tense speaking of a status, the status of being in violation."
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,751.436,785.59,"You may then be engaged in an on-going violation and, in fact, under our definition, you may be able to xx because an on-going xx present non-compliance because of a failure to correct an underlying difficulty, and if you have in fact, violated for several times, you have done nothing about it, and the suit is brought, that may be an on-going violation, may be perfectly proper to sue."
1987.86-473,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.484,829.186,Is had knowledge clear?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,843.01,853.384,I don't think there's any question about xx An the District Court ultimately held and the xx pointed out to you and where he said we were xx compliance and also.
1987.86-473,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.384,861.121,I didn't ask whether you were; I asked was it clear at the time that the suit was filed that the new equipment was effective to do the job.
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,861.121,864.34,"I think so, and this is the reason that I say so, Your Honor."
1987.86-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.496,903.484,But the fact it's unavoidable doesn't get you off the hook.
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,907.019,911.221,"Well, let me say two things to that, Your Honor."
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1032.765,1040.954,"Well, Mr. Prettyman, what's the test for violation and to get into court in this citizens suit?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1050.393,1050.826,Correct.
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1119.62,1129.928,"And if there's any question about the efficacy of the so-called correction, is that something that would xx the citizen to sue and litigate about?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1129.928,1131.795,Might well.
1987.86-473,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.973,1155.893,"So, possibly, the Plaintiffs below had at least that much of a complaint with regard to the TKN problem."
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1155.893,1168.47,"With great respect, Justice O'Connor, that just isn't possible in this case because they knew that we had installed a system."
1987.86-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1178.043,1205.743,"Mr. Prettyman, didn't the District Court find, I think this is the word they used, that the attempt to correct was lackadaisical and exceedingly unconcerned attitude toward correcting anything, and in the thirty-one months prior to the suit, the plant was in compliance with permit conditions only four months?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1205.743,1218.236,"--That, Your Honor, related to the prior period, when we were still wrestling with getting this whole thing into place, and we may well have been in violation, in an on-going violation at that time."
1987.86-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1258.361,1259.813,Mr. Prettyman?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1259.813,1260.263,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1260.263,1267.083,"If they put it in twelve months ahead of time, they wouldn't have had that problem, would they?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1267.083,1273.087,"If they had put the new system in before they did, it would have stopped sooner?"
1987.86-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1273.087,1273.787,Yes.
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1273.787,1276.456,"There's no question about that, Your Honor, and I'm not--"
1987.86-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1276.456,1280.475,There would have been no possibility of filing a suit.
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1280.475,1283.176,--That's--
1987.86-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1283.176,1283.709,But they didn't.
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1283.709,1304.542,"--Well, I wouldn't say that there's no possibility of filing a suit, depending upon how quickly they did it and what xx but this suit is not about, and even Respondents do not say it is about, whether the penalties were correct, assuming that penalties should be issued because we didn't move quickly enough."
1987.86-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.398,1338.029,"Mr. Prettyman, suppose there is an on-going violation under your own definition at the time the suit is filed, but within two or three months, the whole matter is cleared up, now, you would say the suit was proper at the outset, but does it then... should it then be dismissed when there is compliance?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1338.029,1348.635,"--If there was jurisdiction at the time that the suit was brought because there was an on-going violation at that time, the District Court got jurisdiction."
1987.86-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.635,1351.856,Got jurisdiction and the citizens suit was proper at that time.
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1351.856,1352.589,Correct.
1987.86-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.589,1355.725,What happens then when there is compliance?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1355.725,1363.663,"Well, first of all, I assume if he was satisfied with the compliance, he would not issue an injunction, but he may well issue penalties."
1987.86-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.663,1364.346,For what?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1364.346,1371.817,For the period up until the time that they stopped.
1987.86-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.817,1381.875,"Why could he... well, why should he be able to issue penalties for violations prior to the filing of the suit?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1381.875,1398.552,"Because, Your Honor, at the time the suit was filed, there was jurisdiction and the reason that there was jurisdiction was that this statute required an on-going violation at the time suit was filed and in your hypothetical, there was an on-going violation."
1987.86-473,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.552,1401.187,"So, you essentially agreed with the Government in that regard?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1401.187,1401.956,Absolutely.
1987.86-473,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1416.798,1433.575,"Mr. Prettyman, I take it your answer to one of Justice White's questions, however, is, or is it, that under those circumstances, the District Court should dismiss the complaint?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1433.575,1434.375,No.
1987.86-473,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1434.375,1440.581,"Jurisdiction and then there was compliance, what happens to the lawsuit?"
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1440.581,1440.964,No.
1987.86-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.948,1686.935,Isn't the Government's position that it should apply something like Rule 11 of good faith belief?
1987.86-473,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1686.935,1689.887,"Yes, but look what that does, Your Honor."
1987.86-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.39,1745.356,"Very well, Mr. Prettyman."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1747.508,1749.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-473,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.45,1814.486,"Is that in Footnote 8, on page 38(a)?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1814.486,1821.223,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.833,1936.681,"Well, Mr. Claiborne, what about the Footnotes 25 and 26 that Mr. Prettyman referred to in the District Court Opinion, which basically say the District Court believes that to conclude there were continuing violations would be too speculative on the present record?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1936.681,1943.251,"I think those, Justice O'Connor, those two statements can be reconciled."
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1975.52,1981.959,You don't think the District Court Opinion reflects the situation as of the conclusion of the trial?
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1981.959,1983.659,"I do, Your Honor."
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1983.659,1992.832,And that these footnotes indicate that the Court found that too speculative to find an on-going violation at that time?
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1992.832,1996.636,"That is exactly... Justice O'Connor, I may have mis-spoken."
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.463,2048.818,"Once the trial was over, how does the Court know what's happened between the time the record is closed and he writes the opinion?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2048.818,2061.828,"I don't know, Your Honor, I, frankly, don't know whether the Court was made aware of the absence of violations between December and June."
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.828,2065.112,"Well, I would suppose that he was reflecting in these footnotes what was true at the termination of the trial."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2065.112,2069.831,"Well, I'm attempting to tax the District Judge with--"
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.831,2074.219,That would be the normal... wouldn't that be the normal assumption?
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2074.219,2075.686,"--Well, Your Honor,--"
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.686,2078.353,That he'd be writing his opinion based on the record that was made.
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2078.353,2096.215,"--the footnote to which I have referred, Footnote 8, very clearly indicates that not only in the Court's view, but in view of the expert for the Defendant there is ground to fear that the problem had not been solved as of the date of trial in December 1984."
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.215,2111.242,"Well, why shouldn't the rule be for this jurisdictional argument or the citizen bringing suit, at the time of filing the suit, which in a lot of courts will be an awful long time before the trial."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2111.242,2158.306,"Your Honor, xx is only a preamble to xx is Your Honor has indicated, xx is perhaps a little logic in focusing on the state of mind of the Plaintiff and the grounds for objective belief at the time of filing as opposed to the time of judgment, and, yet, my learned friend, seem to indicate that he would condone the assessment of penalties entirely for the past provided that at the time of filing there were an on-going violation, even though it had been demonstrated that the problem was cured before judgment was entered."
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.953,2211.774,"So, you want us to take the case as it comes to us and decide whether the Court of Appeals is right or wrong?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2211.774,2212.541,Indeed.
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.541,2213.241,On its theory?
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2213.241,2214.291,On its theory.
1987.86-473,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.291,2226.783,"On your construction of the statute, what do you make of the purpose of the sixty-day notice provision, which your opponent says doesn't make sense unless it's given opportunity to abate?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2226.783,2231.235,I'm grateful to the Chief Justice for having focused my attention on that question.
1987.86-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.373,2272.209,But the notice doesn't just go to the Government; it's notice both to the Government and to the violator.
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2273.409,2281.548,"--I suppose, Justice Scalia, that there are two reasons for the notice going to the violator."
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2348.424,2349.707,"Well, Mr. Claiborne,--"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2349.707,2351.542,--and ever bearing on the--
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2351.542,2373.79,"--I'm troubled by suppose we have a situation of two or three isolated violations, five years before the suit is filed, and the citizen files the suit seeking only civil penalties for those prior violations."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2377.944,2383.847,"--I would say, Justice O'Connor, there may be a question about whether five years is beyond--"
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2383.847,2384.68,"Well, there's no statute of limitations."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2384.68,2386.547,"--Well, that's not entirely clear."
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2388.632,2389.834,"Well, let's not go off on that."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2391.617,2396.485,--It so happens the statute of limitations would be applicable as a five-year one which is the only reason I mentioned it.
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2408.893,2412.595,"Well, now, the penalties go only to the Government, is that right?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2412.595,2413.645,That is so.
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2413.645,2420.766,And how does the citizen have standing in a constitutional sense to come in and get those?
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2420.766,2426.254,"Well, let me say, first, that the question of standing had not been taken to this Court."
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2426.254,2432.824,"Well, I know, but doesn't that form an interpretation of the statute?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2432.824,2447.768,"Well, it may be that because the standing in strict sense is jurisdictional, it's before this Court in any event, and I'm not trying to avoid the question; I'm just giving a preparatory explanation."
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2538.408,2539.824,"Well, it seems to me--"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2539.824,2540.224,"But, thirdly,--"
1987.86-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2540.224,2545.562,--that really is stretching any traditional notice of standing.
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2545.562,2547.847,"--Your Honor, I think not."
1987.86-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.651,2594.143,"On that analysis, you would say that Congress would have the power to confer standing upon any citizen to prosecute violations of crimes within his community, right?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2606.117,2621.976,"Justice Scalia, there are, I assume, independent reasons not related to standing why an individual ought not be permitted to prosecute criminally."
1987.86-473,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2635.184,2657.78,"But I thought your answer to Justice O'Connor's question was that you had to be affected by the particular pollution in question before you could sue as a citizen and, therefore, it seems to me your answer to Justice Scalia ought to be the logical counterpart would be to allow victims to bring a prosecution for crime but not just anyone in the community."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2657.78,2695.389,"--Well, I suppose that Justice Scalia was really asking me, and I shouldn't be making such assumptions, whether this same citizen who lives on or near the river would have equal standing to bring a criminal prosecution as he does in my submission to bring an action for civil penalties, and put that way, my answer is yes, he's got equal standing, but the privilege of prosecution is one that, for other constitutional reasons, not standing, are not available to the ordinary citizen."
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.389,2707.095,"You never got to your third reason, the third way that a citizen... that this person is affected."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2707.095,2710.963,"Justice White, the third way is in deterring others--"
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.963,2711.913,I see.
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2711.913,2728.424,"--on the same river who would otherwise feel sanguine about polluting the river, and I must say that we are talking here about the imposition of civil penalties, not a marginal peripheral unimportant sanction."
1987.86-473,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.047,2791.749,Are attorneys' fees available in these suits?
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2791.749,2795.117,"They're available in both directions, Your Honor."
1987.86-473,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.268,2830.04,"Mr. Claiborne, what is the status of the civil plaintiff who's a property owner along the river who says his property was damaged by the pollution?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2831.492,2854.155,"--Under this Court's holding that there is no action for damages in federal law, he would not be able to invoke either the Clean Water Act or the Federal Common Law in order to make himself whole, but he would be free to invoke state damage remedies."
1987.86-473,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.155,2856.023,Isn't that sort of anomalous?
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2856.023,2857.757,It would be state law to obtain damages.
1987.86-473,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.757,2865.229,"Isn't it sort of anomalous that there's no federal remedy for the direct injury, but there's standing to sue on behalf of the Government for penalties?"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2865.229,2869.348,"Well, it isn't--"
1987.86-473,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.348,2870.367,"Not really on behalf of, but--"
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2870.367,2930.756,"--It would be extraordinary if the solution to the standing problem were to have a Treetom action, which the Court has more than once indicated presents no constitutional problem, which Congress only last year reaffirmed and widened with respect to the False Claims Act, thereby if we had a Treetom action in which the informer had a pecuniary interest because he got a share of the assessment and, yet, he would widen the class of potential plaintiffs to include any citizen, as is true under the False Claims Act, now that simply cannot be a way one solves a constitutional standing problem and, yet, it would seem to be, if this Court were to hold that there is such a problem, a simple remedy for Congress at the next session."
1987.86-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3215.321,3228.229,"--Mr. Claiborne, that section may bring the realization of the question I asked you because it permits the citizen to intervene as a matter of right in the criminal action apparently."
1987.86-473,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3228.229,3233.533,"--Again, Justice Scalia, I wonder whether they really meant it."
1987.86-473,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3445.015,3446.534,"Thank you, Mr. Claiborne."
1987.86-473,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3449.569,3454.188,"Just a few very quick point, Your Honor."
1987.86-473,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3545.663,3547.78,"Thank you, Mr. Prettyman."
