1978.77-388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.493,"The first case on for argument this morning is Number 77-388, Washington and others against the Confederated Bands and Tribes of the Yakima Indian Nation."
1978.77-388,0,41407,slade_gorton,,42.246,46.039,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2285.092,2288.192,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.856,2309.866,On what grounds do you present this issue of?
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2309.866,2326.567,"Mr. Justice White, we take view I hope correctly that an appellee is entitled to defend the judgment in his favor under Section 1254 (2) of the judicial code on any federal ground."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.567,2337.395,"But what if the success of your -- what if your ground, if you succeeded, if it were sustained, would that give considerably different relief?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2337.395,2340.532,"There -- Mr. Justice White, there might be a problem."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.13,2356.511,"Oh, I thought this -- if you invalidate it on the ground that you are about to urge, it would invalidate the entire law, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2360.335,2364.634,"But Mr. Justice White, so did the panel decision in this case find --"
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.634,2365.805,On equal protection ground?
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2365.805,2378.359,"Finding impossible to sever the permissible and impermissible portions, the Ninth Circuit struck down the entire Washington laws."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.952,2383.844,That's the way you interpret it?
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2383.844,2386.574,"That is so, Mr. Justice White."
1978.77-388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.951,2515.109,"Don't you have some problem with the equal footing clause and the distinction between the five states you're talking about and the other states of which you were -- so that Washington was not given equal footing when it was admitted to the union, if you're construction is correct."
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2536.713,2553.889,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I take it that there would have been no constitutional difficulty in Congress' including Washington with the other five, making it six, just as they did in the case of Alaska, a disclaimer state."
1978.77-388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2553.889,2559.136,"Well, there would have been some difficulty in treating Oregon and Washington differently, wouldn't they?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2559.136,2560.911,But they did.
1978.77-388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.028,2578.084,But how about the constitutionality of the Enabling Act?
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2578.084,2581.425,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I'm obviously missing the thrust of your question."
1978.77-388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.339,2632.985,"My question -- my question goes further back in that and what I'm referring to is the doctrine of the Coyle case which is 221 US 559 where the Court said that even though Congress puts -- insists that a state put something in its constitution as a condition for coming into the union, the state may later repudiate that if the result of not repudiating would be to give it less of an equal footing than the other states that were admitted without it."
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2632.985,2639.091,"Well, I'm not in the least attempting to take on the Coyle case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.131,2819.016,"Do you think in view of the language of Section 6 that even though only a statutory amendment had required -- had been required under state law, that would nonetheless have to have been “by the people” rather than by the legislature?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2819.016,2825.581,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, had the obstacle only been statutory, the legislative history is ambiguous."
1978.77-388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.859,2840.496,And yet the language is exactly the same in the law as written.
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2840.496,2853.49,"But do -- when Mr. -- I suggest Mr. Justice Rehnquist, look at it in this way, the words where necessary or introduced for one of two reasons, we suggest."
1978.77-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.934,2926.605,"Mr. Claiborne, I'm not sure that completely answers Justice Rehnquist's question because both in the proviso and in the introductory portion of 6 is a reference to the people amending the constitution or statute as the case may be."
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2932.724,2948.465,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I think the choice of the word people was because of the recognition that it a Constitution, in the case of Washington and as everywhere else, has to be by popular referendum, but that would -- does do doubles service."
1978.77-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.845,2962.077,And you in your view of the word people as used in both parts of Section 6 can refer to acts by the legislature without a popular referendum?
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2962.077,2967.353,Insofar as it addresses statutory -- only statutory impediments.
1978.77-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.235,2981.967,I agree it's the best you can do.
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2981.967,2999.419,"Now, set me the question whether Congress acted on its understanding, right or wrong, that the Washington Constitution was an impediment that only popular referendum could erase is a federal question."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.672,3049.756,"Do you think if after Congress acted on that assumption, Washington amended its constitution so as to make amendments adoptable just by the legislature?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3049.756,3059.753,"I'm not -- Mr. Justice White, that's an interesting in-between situation which fortunately, we don't have to face but --"
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.753,3071.511,"Oh, I don't know the -- since that time, the Supreme Court of Washington has interpreted its constitution to not to require a referendum."
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3071.511,3076.758,"Had they amended their constitution to so provide, we might have a closer question."
1978.77-388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3110.437,3114.132,If the language had been simply by law?
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3114.132,3114.773,"Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3114.773,3115.972,"And there'd be no problem, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3115.972,3126.049,And we say that -- construed in the light of its legislative history that is what the court is confronted with in Section 6.
1978.77-388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3151.704,3159.335,"But -- or whether or not -- but your contention that Congress was correct in its understanding is not really a necessary part of your argument, is it?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3159.335,3160.277,Indeed.
1978.77-388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3163.322,3172.975,"Because your basic argument is that right or whether Congress was right or wrong about the necessity of providing what it did, it did in fact so provide."
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3172.975,3174.518,"Indeed, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.77-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.253,3220.753,"Mr. Claiborne, before you sit down, I'd like to ask you one further question on the jurisdictional problem that Justice White identified."
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3238.237,3257.946,"Mr. Justice Stevens, it is certainly correct that our submission would, though perhaps not in this case, but the logic of our submission would invalidate those assumptions with respect to tribes between 1957 and 1963 who took on full jurisdiction."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.018,3284.687,"The opinion on the Ninth Circuit just dealt with one section, its equal protection clause, Subsection 10 -- of the -- how about the --"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3284.687,3289.315,I think I stand corrected and withdraw the answer.
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.315,3290.246,And how about the --
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3301.132,3301.651,Insofar as --
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.651,3306.62,What about whites against Indians?
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3306.62,3311.477,"Well, there I think the Ninth Circuit did hold that one couldn't pass it out."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3311.477,3321.589,"Well, it dealt with only one Section and that Section dealt only with Indian defendants."
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3321.589,3332.118,"Well, I had thought, and I may be wrong Mr. Justice White, that what the Ninth Circuit has held was the 63 Act is unconstitutional, is violative of equal protection."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.309,3361.084,"Well, it said we invalidate Section 37.12.010 and 37.12.010 cited in its footnote, just deals with in Indian defendants, doesn't it?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3361.084,3365.063,But if one looks at the jurisdictional statement at page 35 --
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.063,3366.808,Yes.
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3366.808,3380.517,"Mr. Justice White, on the right hand column, we are -- can the invalidated portion of Section so forth be separated from the remainder of the statute or does the whole statute fall?"
1978.77-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3427.792,3429.435,That's just the 1963 Act (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3429.435,3430.925,That's only the 1963 Act.
1978.77-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.925,3434.056,-- 1957 Act with your present submission would.
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3434.056,3445.437,"Mr. Justice Stevens, as I think I indicated, I must withdraw the answer I gave to Mr. Justice White and agree that -- to that extent, the results appeared to be different, that is to say that the question there --"
1978.77-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3445.437,3451.851,Then the question they had raised is and I don't know the answer to the question that raises -- does that affect our jurisdiction to entertain this particular argument.
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3451.851,3473.44,"The result may be, Mr. Justice Stevens, that while the successful appellee can hardly be deprived of his judgment when he had no standing to bring the case here and is therefore entitled to defend it on any federal ground, perhaps the judgment cannot go further than we would have gone than it was in his favor below."
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.794,3481.636,"In any event, it's a sort of a housekeeping rule, isn't it?"
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3481.636,3484.721,Indeed Mr. Justice White because this Court itself indicated its willingness to entertain --
1978.77-388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.721,3489.53,In reaching -- in reaching statutory questions first is also a housekeeping rule.
1978.77-388,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3489.53,3509.506,And it is the reason of course without intending to disparage any other argument that we put the statutory questions first and foremost.
1978.77-388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3509.506,3511.355,Mr. Hovis.
1978.77-388,2,30760,james_b_hovis,,3511.355,3516.032,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it pleases the Court."
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5247.617,5249.893,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1978.77-388,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5293.172,5293.63,Right.
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5293.63,5296.681,Precisely every prosecuting attorney in the state knows that.
1978.77-388,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5296.681,5306.51,"Well, your opponents suggest that Washington has never assumed jurisdiction over crime by non-whites."
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5306.51,5308.819,That's simply nonsense.
1978.77-388,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5327.164,5330.095,"Oh, I picked this up from your brief."
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5342.065,5343.484,Non-Indians.
1978.77-388,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5343.484,5344.136,And that the Federal Government will assume that.
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5344.136,5345.701,It will --
1978.77-388,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5347.667,5356.308,But that would not -- that would not expand their -- that would not expand the relief to the other side.
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5358.99,5359.979,The Ninth Circuit --
1978.77-388,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5370.8,5373.112,"Mr. Gorton, you said except something and I'm --"
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5373.112,5375.061,Except for the McBratney exception.
1978.77-388,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5375.061,5375.435,"Oh, yes."
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5375.435,5376.094,The state would still --
1978.77-388,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5376.094,5377.482,A non-Indian against a non-Indian.
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5377.482,5378.41,A non-Indian.
1978.77-388,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5405.701,5411.538,What about Indians committing crimes on fee lands within the reservation?
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5411.538,5416.428,On fee lands within the reservations are totally subject to state jurisdiction.
1978.77-388,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5416.428,5425.252,And so there does -- there is a difference as to who prosecutes misdemeanors.
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5426.528,5428.095,Yes.
1978.77-388,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5489.674,5498.232,"But what if the tribal policeman is acting as a county deputy sheriff, wouldn't the arrest figures show that the arrest was made by a deputy sheriff?"
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5498.232,5503.722,"No, the arrest figures that were given there were arrest figures by the county sheriff."
1978.77-388,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5503.722,5504.344,Not by the deputy?
1978.77-388,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5504.344,5517.368,"Not -- not by anyone else, not by the state patrol, which among other things have four times as many arrests as the county sheriff did, and which is also cross-deputized by the tribal police."
