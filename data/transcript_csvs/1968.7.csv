1968.7,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,48.592,"Number 7, Susan Epperson Et Al, Dallas versus Arkansas."
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,52.054,56.445,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,295.077,296.662,Mr. Warren may I ask?
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,296.662,297.279,Yes sir.
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,297.279,301.989,Would you be taking the same position under the First Amendment if these statute --
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,301.989,302.972,Yes.--
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,302.972,311.223,"Which as I -- as I read it, it says that it's unlawful to teach in any University college, normal public schools and so forth."
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,322.596,326.097,I would take the same position but not quite as strongly.
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,326.097,326.853,I don't understand.
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,326.853,345.036,"Well, I think that the case of the Bartels, an Iowa case where the -- that was the Iowa case and the Nebraska case, Meyer case that those statute prohibiting the teaching of German only applied to the elementary schools and this Court in those two cases struck down those axe under the Due Process Clause."
1968.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,345.036,346.986,But those were private schools?
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,346.986,349.164,The -- in Meyer case was a public school.
1968.7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.164,352.77,"Well, that's right, my --"
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,352.77,365.956,"But you're familiar, I don't know that you cited it with -- old decisions in the obscenity area, for example in the Ginsburg case of last term and the --"
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,365.956,366.034,Yeah.
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,366.034,368.775,Buffer and Michigan and those cases.
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,381.354,382.648,"Yes Mr. Justice Brennan, I would think --"
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,382.648,384.661,You don't take that same kind of line could be drawn?
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,384.661,395.183,No sir I take the position that the curriculum of the public schools even the elementary grade is not a matter for the ballot but is a matter of for the proper educational officers.
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,395.183,416.832,"Well, I suppose you had a statute that just said that it shall be unlawful to teach in Grades one through six depending on the color of the skin, one race is inferior to another race."
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,416.832,417.005,"Well, I think --"
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,417.005,418.43,Do you think that would be unconstitutional?
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,418.43,421.943,"Yes I think that clearly be unconstitutional, I certainly do."
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,421.943,430.142,So you don't think any lines can be drawn at all depending upon the level of --
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,430.142,431.078,Of the age.
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,431.078,435.197,"--of the education, primary versus high school and so on."
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,435.197,465.885,"I must say that I believe that these are matters for educators and not for the ballot but as I have to go back when the Supreme -- when this case was decided by the Supreme Court of Arkansas, it made the statement in the second line that the Court -- that we do not decide whether the Act forbids the discussion or explanation of the theory are forbids whether the theory was true."
1968.7,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,486.77,489.043,"But there's also a fine, isn't there?"
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,489.043,491.042,"A $500.00 fine, yes sir."
1968.7,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,491.042,496.491,"Has there been any prosecution under this statute that is -- was it, 1923?"
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,496.491,497.243,26.
1968.7,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,497.243,497.815,26.
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,497.834,500.743,"Mr. Justice Fortas, to my knowledge there has not been."
1968.7,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,513.682,514.923,0833
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,514.923,515.26,Sir?
1968.7,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,515.26,521.261,Maybe there's enough 0837
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,521.261,531.266,"I don't know Mr. Justice Black, I just really hate to say whether there was any danger or not, there was a lot -- there's a lot of uncertainty and a lot of fright."
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,643.05,648.677,"Well, did you say -- has the statute been constituted to which you're referring, the teachers referring to --"
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,648.677,653.171,"Well, the statute has not been -- has not been -- at school those --"
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,653.171,664.559,On its face it seems -- on its face it seems that we generally makes it unlawful for any teacher to adapt or use in the institution.
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,664.559,668.95,"To use, a teacher to use or a textbook commissioned to adapt."
1968.7,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,668.95,678.204,"Well, does not mean like, ordinarily our textbooks formally adapted for use in the given class or by -- in the teaching of a given course?"
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,678.204,685.368,"Well, the dictionary in Arkansas has been adapted as a textbook and is furnished under the textbook law."
1968.7,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,715.236,725.014,"Do you see any different before you sit down Mr. Warren, do you see any difference between -- is it a matter of law between this case Meyer against Nebraska?"
1968.7,0,23405,eugene_r_warren,,725.014,728.14,"I see no difference, not much was."
1968.7,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,729.826,732.774,Mr. Langston.
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,732.774,736.614,May it please the Court.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.678,769.459,What was the significance with that?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,769.459,775.0,I was just -- just background Your Honor.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,775.0,779.05,"Oh, I just thought you were telling us your administration doesn't like the statute either."
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,779.05,783.888,"No Your Honor, I'm not here prepared to say that."
1968.7,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,783.888,790.167,It might not be too late you know.
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,790.167,802.729,"The reason -- the reason the State of Arkansas is involved in this lawsuit as you would recall from the record, the plaintiff sued the Little Rock School District and its superintendent."
1968.7,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,850.126,854.808,Indefinitely even the class this year?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,854.808,863.605,"Yes, we have always interpreted that domain that we are to defend the constitutionality of this statute Your Honor."
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,924.635,927.022,Maybe they couldn't Mr. Langston.
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,927.022,939.06,I have heard rumors to that effect but I did not think it's true.
1968.7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,985.703,996.368,Should be interpreted to the effect that there is a criminal offense for a teacher to make students aware that there is such a theory?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,996.368,999.777,That is correct Your Honor.
1968.7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.714,1010.923,So you think we should take the Arkansas statute as meaning that --
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1010.923,1013.366,Yes Your Honor.
1968.7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.611,1025.698,And as meaning that it does really -- it does -- it does reach the teaching about as well as affirmatively teaching the rightness of something?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1025.698,1027.73,If I get your question correct --
1968.7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.73,1033.237,I mean it would cover a teacher telling about -- telling about Darwin --
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1033.237,1033.377,Yes.
1968.7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.377,1036.43,-- as well as -- as well as teaching that Darwin was right?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1036.43,1038.085,That's correct.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1053.959,1063.724,"Well, I have some trouble with that and the same as to my -- you mean you get that out of the second sentence, the Court expresses no opinion on the question."
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1063.724,1090.078,"I am saying that I think that the lower Courts of Arkansas would interpret, would hold that Senate's irrelevant Your Honor and say that, although the Supreme Court of Arkansas did not and I think if the Supreme Court of Arkansas would present it with the prosecution under this case that they would disobey that second sentence in the per curiam opinion."
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.078,1103.476,"Well, I mean, this has only been suggested to you on problem I take it is to decide the constitutional question on the basis of the authoritative interpretation of the statute by the highest state court, isn't it?"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1103.476,1103.908,Yes Your Honor.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.918,1111.962,"Now, what are we to take to be the authoritative interpretation of this statute for the Supreme Court of Arkansas?"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1111.962,1115.574,I take the first sentence of the per curiam opinion Your Honor.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1115.574,1120.77,And that is that it's a valid exercise or the state's power to specify the quick 1839 public schools?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1120.77,1122.308,Yes Your Honor and they have not --
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1122.308,1122.733,"Well, --"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1122.733,1128.029,And they have not decided the question that I have said.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1128.029,1152.431,"No, but what concerns me, going back to the question I asked your adversary earlier, are we to take this to mean that as much as I have said is this statute is valid as regarding -- as regards to quick limit at public schools meaning primary schools or does this mean that if valid as regards to teaching and in the University College, Normal Public School or other institutions?"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1152.431,1155.634,I think any text supported school in Arkansas will be covered.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1155.634,1159.015,"So public schools here include University College, Normal --"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1159.015,1160.745,That's correct.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1162.137,1167.471,"Well then, may I ask you the question I asked your adversary earlier."
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1189.525,1190.79,No sir I do not.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1190.79,1191.618,See none.
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1207.757,1214.307,"Of course, I guess what you're getting at is the impression of modern -- of younger children --"
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1214.307,1214.442,Yeah.
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1214.442,1217.755,--and the children in this but I do not see any distinction in this.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1232.202,1241.737,"Well, I know what you're defending it on the ground that it's constitutional do deny any teachers the right to teach this even the Normal School of College, don't you?"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1241.737,1248.112,Yes sir.
1968.7,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1294.159,1302.634,What is the State interest that you're protecting through the statute?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1302.634,1334.691,"Well, we feel that that the state has a right to set the curriculum in its schools and that's the -- that's our main point Your Honor that the state can prescribe it's curriculum in schools and don't have chaos and explains to that nature whenever in the teaching of this courses there."
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1362.464,1377.182,Would you in the same ground defend the statute to prohibit the teaching of the theory that some races are inferior to others?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1377.182,1380.438,"I would think that that should be prohibited, yes sir."
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1380.438,1390.928,That that could constitutionally be done?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1390.928,1404.25,"To be consistent with my argument, I would have to say that I, of course, I think that the state in prescribing the courses in the schools could say what theories can and cannot be taught there."
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1404.25,1404.546,And I suppose --
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1426.291,1443.029,Of course I've -- there's -- don't have to be a line drawn here somewhere but -- of course I wouldn't move the children of Arkansas to --
1968.7,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1443.029,1446.864,That's our problem too.
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1446.864,1454.272,I might say that I'm glad that your problem and my --[Laughs]
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1454.272,1459.237,Apparently the Supreme Court of Arkansas felt the same way.[Laughs]
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1459.237,1465.279,That could be another rumor Your Honor.
1968.7,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1506.015,1506.375,What do you say about the rest of the --
1968.7,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.375,1523.959,"Mr. Langston, since the -- your Supreme Court dispose of the lower court's opinion in two sentences, would you object as disposing of that one in one strength?"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1523.959,1547.43,"According to how did -- I say Your Honor that it does not establish or this establish it that as I stated in my brief that it is a Neutrality Act and keeps from discussing the Darwin theory and its opposing theories in the law, in the schools."
1968.7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1547.43,1553.584,"It says anything about its opposing theory, does it?"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1553.584,1555.622,No it does not Your Honor.
1968.7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1555.622,1564.31,"It simply forbids the teaching of -- to say the Darwinian Theory, doesn't it?"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1581.446,1593.706,"Well, I would first of all hope that the Courts would -- our people would think that that would be an unreasonable encroachment upon --"
1968.7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1593.706,1596.705,But why?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1603.904,1623.365,"Well, of course our position is that the Courts should restrain from doing so as much as possible because it should be left up to the local school boards and the local people as to how their schools should be run and to what curriculum should be taught yesterday."
1968.7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1623.365,1628.179,"Well, this isn't a kind of a case that would be presented."
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1647.821,1649.968,That's correct.
1968.7,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1649.968,1656.5,"How about the subject sex, does Arkansas have any prohibitions on teaching in the field of sex?"
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1656.5,1660.192,"I have heard none Your Honor, I do not know."
1968.7,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1660.192,1664.742,Mr. Langston I appreciate your problem here.
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1682.027,1683.364,Is that the --
1968.7,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1683.364,1684.558,German Language?
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1684.558,1685.658,English Language?
1968.7,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1685.658,1689.785,Yeah.
1968.7,1,21143,don_langston,,1689.785,1696.144,The only way I could do it Your Honor would be the reason at least and unreasonable aspect of it.
1968.7,2,23405,eugene_r_warren,,1843.879,1848.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, with your permission may we submit the case as is."
1968.7,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1848.158,1848.727,Alright.
