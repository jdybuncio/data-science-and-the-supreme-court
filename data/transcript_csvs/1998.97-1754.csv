1998.97-1754,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.479,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-1754, Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Juan Anibal Aguirre."
1998.97-1754,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,17.574,18.185,Yes.
1998.97-1754,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,67.118,76.605,"What, by the way, if you have a chance, are we supposed to do about the fact that the individual now says that isn't a correct translation; he didn't stone any individuals."
1998.97-1754,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,85.71,106.614,"First of all, we disagree it is important, but even if the Court considered that it was, the respondent has filed a motion to remand with the Board of Immigration Appeals and, I think consistent with this Court's decision in Stone v. INS, this Court can go ahead and proceed to review the judgment that's before it and allow that motion to proceed on its own track."
1998.97-1754,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.614,110.418,"Well, this tape question is a very late-in-the-day thing, is it not?"
1998.97-1754,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,110.418,111.74,It most certainly is.
1998.97-1754,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.292,117.185,It wasn't presented to the Ninth Circuit at all.
1998.97-1754,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,117.185,125.861,"--Not at all, even though the same counsel represented Mr. Aguirre there, but that... again, the motion is pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals."
1998.97-1754,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.737,155.143,"Now, it is suggested by the respondent that somehow the board's and the Government's interpretation of the statutory standard differs in some way from that recommended pursuant to the convention and the protocol that bind other nations generally."
1998.97-1754,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,155.143,155.852,Uh-huh.
1998.97-1754,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.852,167.391,"The language in the convention and protocol looks about the same, but they say the Handbook somehow establishes a more egregious standard."
1998.97-1754,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,176.294,181.95,"In this particular regard, on the question of balancing the risk of persecution there are a couple of other things--"
1998.97-1754,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.95,182.259,"Uh-huh, yes."
1998.97-1754,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,182.259,185.163,"--the Ninth Circuit required that haven't, as far as we know, been addressed by other countries."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1526.939,1531.431,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.114,1563.584,"Well, the issue before us is whether the court of appeals correctly decided this case, isn't it, and there are... the question presented is whether the court of appeals erred in reversing the decision of the BIA."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1566.874,1568.116,"Well, Your Honor--"
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.116,1575.742,"If the Ninth Circuit was wrong, even if the BIA was wrong, that does not mean that we would simply say, go back to the BIA."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1575.742,1596.145,"--Your Honor, the BIA... rather, the court of appeals gave three reasons for reversing the BIA, and two of those three reasons were that the board did not correctly apply its own test set out in the Matter of McMullen, which is a BIA decision setting forth the standards for determining serious nonpolitical crime."
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1639.643,1651.562,"I really find that difficult to follow, because the McMullen test was a test that was said on the way to saying that the applicant there did not qualify for any dispensation."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1684.232,1697.532,"Your Honor, McMullen mirrors and incorporates the Handbook standard, paragraph 152 of the Handbook, which sets out five tests, and when you apply those tests in this case--"
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1697.532,1705.928,"I thought the board has always said, up until the other case, that it isn't taking any position on this balancing."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1716.613,1719.976,"--Well, Your Honor, there are two different kinds of balancing here."
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.592,1747.065,Isn't it agreed that the Attorney General and the United States are not bound by the Handbook?
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1747.065,1757.893,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's certainly agreed, but the board has adopted the paragraph 152 in the matter of McMullen, so it wouldn't necessarily be bound otherwise, but--"
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.893,1760.444,That balancing is a balancing of what?
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1760.444,1764.315,"--It's a balancing of the political-nonpolitical question, Your Honor."
1998.97-1754,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.917,1780.577,"Do you mean, it's out of proportion to the political objections--"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1780.577,1781.078,--That's right.
1998.97-1754,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.078,1784.26,"--objectives, or out of proportion to the common law character of the crime?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1784.26,1788.08,Whether the act is out of proportion to the goals.
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.778,1825.557,"Is there in the Handbook or, more particularly, are there in previous board opinions... think of previous board opinions."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1863.133,1868.879,"Well, McMullen, Your Honor, is the chief board decision about this."
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.656,1905.972,"Why isn't the test not whether the board has followed an earlier precedent of its own, but whether the board's action conforms to the statute?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1920.871,1926.364,"--No, Your Honor, but McMullen is the board's own decision deciding what the statute means, and--"
1998.97-1754,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.364,1932.469,"Well, to whom do we owe deference here, to the Attorney General, or to board precedent, or what?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1932.469,1938.804,"--Well, Your Honor, to return to the Chief Justice's question earlier, the question is, was the court of appeals correct."
1998.97-1754,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.53,1960.756,"Well, is there any room for interpretation of the statute here, and if so, do we look to the Attorney General's interpretation and give it deference, or what do we do?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1960.756,1962.028,"Well, you certainly can do that, Your Honor."
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.05,1980.672,"The board is a creature of the Attorney General, is it not?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1980.672,1981.152,--That's correct.
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.152,1984.274,"I mean, she can overrule anything it does."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,1984.274,1986.525,"Right, but she has not done that here."
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2007.429,2020.228,"Well, doesn't it apply here... to go back to the Chief Justice's question, is there some reason that the most basic rule of administrative law wouldn't apply, namely, an agency cannot change its decision without focusing on it?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2032.206,2032.386,Right.
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.386,2039.792,"--of the BIA's decision that purports to change anything, I would have thought the question would be whether it's consistent with its prior rules."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2042.994,2044.175,That's correct.
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.175,2046.276,"And that's why I asked you, what is the prior rule."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2063.429,2070.603,"Well, yes, Your Honor, I think the Government would agree that the prior rule is Matter of McMullen, and there has been no other decision by the Attorney General."
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.603,2079.63,"Well, are... do you agree with Justice Breyer that an agency could not come out differently in a particular case from the way it had before without some sort of an elaborate procedure?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2079.63,2087.793,"Well, Your Honor, since McMullen is... was the precedent decision here, I think if the board--"
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.793,2102.703,"Well, supposing this were just the Attorney General, you know, not a BIA or something like that, the Attorney General under the... and last year she says, well, I think McMullen is right, then this year she says, well, no, I'm not... I'm going to back away from McMullen some."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2102.703,2104.115,--She certainly could do that.
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.115,2106.046,Is there some administrative law rule that says she can't do that?
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2106.046,2111.069,"Well, Your Honor, she has, in fact, done that in a case where--"
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.069,2114.851,"Aren't you going to answer yes to that, that an agency does have to focus on it?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2114.851,2121.136,"--Well, the Attorney General, Your Honor, is... has authority over the Board of Immigration Appeals."
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.273,2133.043,"Without focusing on it, even."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2136.034,2137.076,Without focusing on it.
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.076,2138.586,--Does Arizona Grocery apply--
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2148.394,2149.155,Well--
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.155,2154.097,"Now, if you say that you agree with Justice Breyer, I'm going to ask you what case you have in mind that says--"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2158.261,2159.012,--Arizona Grocery.
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.002,2161.784,"It's, an agency has to follow its own rules."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2161.784,2163.945,"Well, we don't even have to reach that here, of course."
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.945,2165.343,The agency does have to follow its own rules--
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2165.533,2165.743,Right.
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.743,2166.865,--in the sense of regulations.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2169.476,2173.42,"Well, I don't think we even have to reach that here, because the board did not purport to change its policy."
1998.97-1754,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2173.42,2186.857,"Well, I thought here the board had taken the position in McMullen and in this case that the question of whether a crime is a political offense is primarily one of fact."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2201.898,2205.741,"Uh-huh, that it was... the criminal nature outweighed the political nature."
1998.97-1754,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2205.741,2205.991,Right.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2205.991,2206.86,"But Your Honor, that's all they said."
1998.97-1754,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2228.385,2241.725,"Well, have we applied some special rule in the area of fact determination that says they have to explain it, or can they just determine the facts, and do we owe some deference to that factual determination?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2241.725,2248.379,"--Well, Your Honor, in this case, certainly if they had properly applied the tests they would have reached a separate... a different result."
1998.97-1754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2272.475,2275.366,"Well, advert if you will for a minute to what the Ninth Circuit said."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2291.185,2291.606,That's right.
1998.97-1754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2291.606,2302.953,"And quite obviously the board did not in this case think that whatever the relevance of that factor might be, if relevant at all, would have been in favor of your client."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2325.098,2325.779,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1998.97-1754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.779,2326.049,Did they use that term?
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2326.049,2326.48,That's right.
1998.97-1754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2326.48,2327.201,They used that term?
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2327.201,2330.033,"It applied the gross, and it also applied the atrociousness test."
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.56,2345.951,"Did they say that that was a condition, that that condition always had to exist in order for the crime to be nonpolitical?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2345.951,2351.828,"--No, Your Honor, they didn't say it was a condition, but it does... those were the tests that they applied, and that again mirrors--"
1998.97-1754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.828,2354.492,"They considered it a relevant factor, is that... would that be a fair way to--"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2354.492,2354.82,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1998.97-1754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2354.82,2360.226,"--In McMullen did they say, look, it's just one of the things that ought to be considered, is there gross disproportionality or isn't there?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2360.226,2361.495,Yes.
1998.97-1754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2361.495,2365.168,Without saying that if you satisfy that test a particular result necessarily follows.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2365.168,2365.588,That's right.
1998.97-1754,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2365.588,2365.839,Okay.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2365.839,2372.034,"They did not say, this is an absolute condition, but they said, here is what we consider, and what they consider mirrors the Handbook--"
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.034,2378.267,But they found it nonpolitical here even without finding it to be atrocious.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2397.811,2398.561,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.561,2399.822,I don't even have to consider whether it's atrocious.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2401.545,2402.025,--Uh-huh.
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2402.025,2404.727,It's nonpolitical because of these other reasons.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2404.727,2406.237,"Your Honor, I don't want to mischaracterize what I said."
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.582,2415.303,"Well, then--"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2415.303,2416.655,--so it may be that's a necessary factor.
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.655,2423.27,"--But then it seems to me the agency could have done just exactly what I've said, and certainly we give the agency the benefit of the doubt."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2439.468,2443.853,"Well, Your Honor, it isn't so much a factual determination here as a procedural determination."
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2452.26,2495.918,"I... let's concentrate on what the BIA did, because it seems to me that in characterizing what went on here, it did even what the Handbook says, and it says, in determining whether this is political or nonpolitical, its closest to the political camp when you're acting against the Government or Government personnel, much more iffy if your target, the person you're actually hitting on, is a private individual, or a private company, and then weakest of all when you're hitting on private individuals and you're trying to produce general chaos."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2526.557,2534.133,"Well, Your Honor, the statute does not say, and the Government seems to be trying to read into the statute, the word civilians, or noncivilians."
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.518,2552.296,"Do you agree with the statement that's made in that U.N. brief that the political link is strongest when the target of the activity is Government personnel and property, or is that wrong?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2552.296,2563.693,"I would agree with that, Your Honor, but that does not mean that actions that by necessity are diffused, and not as they were in Guatemala... it wasn't as if you had an armed insurrection against--"
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2563.693,2567.837,But we're talking about what the applicant's acts were.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2583.588,2584.429,--Mm-hmm.
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2584.429,2588.644,"And the... whatever... the bus was privately owned, was it not?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2588.644,2594.434,"Yes, Your Honor, but as in one of the other amicus briefs, the buses were not just simply privately owned."
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2597.456,2601.84,The individuals who were on the bus were just ordinary individuals.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2602.38,2604.763,"--That's true, Your Honor, but of course--"
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2604.763,2604.953,--Government servants.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2604.953,2609.956,"--the goal here was to prevent harm to the passengers, not to hurt the passengers."
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2611.268,2611.458,So that's why they burned them?
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2611.458,2612.139,I'm sorry?
1998.97-1754,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2612.139,2615.261,"That's why they burned them, the buses?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2615.261,2619.333,"Well, no, the buses... the people were moved off the buses before the buses were moved, Your Honor."
1998.97-1754,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2639.459,2643.121,What about the shopkeepers whose merchandise was just trashed?
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2657.253,2661.384,"--Well, Your Honor, obviously in this country in this day and age we don't like these acts."
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.562,2680.067,"Suppose I agreed with you, purely for the sake of argument, on three points... two anyway."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2729.679,2734.895,"Your Honor, the principle that you mentioned earlier, which is--"
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2734.895,2735.075,No.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2772.138,2772.559,--Uh-huh.
1998.97-1754,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2772.559,2773.119,Okay.
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2781.206,2781.486,Right.
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.526,2814.298,"I didn't understand that this was your appeal, that what you were complaining about here is the procedural failure of the board to have an adequate opinion explaining its overruling of the administrative law judge."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2818.261,2825.367,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, because after all the court of appeals gave three reasons for reversing the board."
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.533,2847.169,"Was any... please, let me... was any of the reasons the failure of the board to explain itself in adequate detail?"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2847.169,2849.911,"--Yes, Your Honor, it certainly was."
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2852.763,2853.084,"Yes, I'd... I'd--"
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2853.084,2853.754,--Okay.
1998.97-1754,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.754,2863.662,"--I mean, I know they said the board was wrong, but I don't think that they... I don't recall just a procedural objection."
1998.97-1754,1,37338,nadine_k_wettstein,,2868.575,2870.598,Beginning on page 29 of our brief--
1998.97-1754,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3290.16,3290.988,Absolutely not.
1998.97-1754,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3335.408,3336.94,17a of the petition?
1998.97-1754,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3336.94,3337.531,--Petition appendix.
1998.97-1754,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3390.578,3402.815,"With all that, suppose it were established crystal clear that if this person is sent back to Guatemala he will be horribly tortured, the answer would still be the same?"
1998.97-1754,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3402.815,3405.338,The answer under the withholding of deportation provision would be the same.
1998.97-1754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3417.588,3418.646,"Convention on Torture, you mean."
1998.97-1754,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3418.646,3419.527,--Convention on Torture.
1998.97-1754,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3419.527,3422.371,"There are those of us who think that there should be torture for a convention, maybe--"
1998.97-1754,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3424.933,3427.594,"I apologize, Convention on Torture."
1998.97-1754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3443.705,3452.881,"What's bothering me, and I can't quite get my hands on it, is this... is purports to be, as it's presented, an argument about what standard to apply."
1998.97-1754,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3467.071,3467.912,The problem is that--
1998.97-1754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3467.912,3470.944,"And if I read through this record and come to that conclusion, I'm not sure what to do."
1998.97-1754,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3483.364,3495.062,"--The problem is that in addition to balancing the risk of persecution the Ninth Circuit added two new factors, and it is not at all clear to us that those are not intended to weigh upon this political analysis."
1998.97-1754,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3498.655,3498.895,Which are?
1998.97-1754,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3498.895,3504.87,"One is changing the or atrocious to and atrocious, or and approaching atrociousness."
