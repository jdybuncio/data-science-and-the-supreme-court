1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.487,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-6203, Nathaniel Jones v. The United States."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,7.487,11.106,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-6203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,50.981,64.489,"Has the term elements been used or defined by this Court in a decision, or a series of decisions, or is it... is the term we get from the common law which is a summary of what the actus reis is?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,64.489,67.04,I don't think it is... has been defined.
1998.97-6203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,83.118,86.32,"And I don't recall that that used the term elements, although it might have."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,99.83,101.614,"That may be correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-6203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.077,124.945,So in that sense it's almost conclusory.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,124.945,127.731,--It's almost... I think it's the reverse of the sentencing factor.
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.991,154.381,"Well, the Federal sentencing scheme has a whole array of factors that the sentencer takes into consideration after the conviction for the crime, doesn't it?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,154.381,156.5,"It does, Your Honor, and--"
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.5,163.737,"And quantity of drugs being one of them, and I guess if we were to adopt your position that would be unconstitutional."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,163.737,177.247,"--Well, Your Honor, I think our position is that you have to look to the statute and see whether Congress has identified a particular factor of any kind, and has used that or made that the basis for an increased sentencing range."
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.43,184.132,"So if Congress has spoken to the issue, then we have to treat it as an element of the crime?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,184.132,190.202,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the question that the Court posed in Almendarez-Torres was, what was Congress' intent?"
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.671,197.725,"I'm glad you brought up the case, because I would have thought that might govern the resolution of this case."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,197.725,205.128,"On the statutory question, Your Honor, I think we have a much different statute and we have a much stronger argument that these were not meant to be sentencing factors."
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.946,231.563,"Well, so has injury to a victim."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,244.251,244.635,--I think the--
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.635,247.62,"--and that that was a sentencing factor, very traditionally."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,247.62,250.989,"--It has been that, but it has not been limited to sentencing."
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.107,263.046,"Well, so far as the increase in sentencing is concerned as a result of finding these factors, this isn't as great as Almendarez-Torres."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,263.046,266.533,You mean the amount of the increase?
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.533,266.833,Yes.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,266.833,270.568,"Well, it would be if the death had resulted as a serious bodily injury."
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.568,272.52,"Yes, but that were not... that wasn't the case here."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,272.52,275.555,"No, that's correct, but the actual increase is not as great."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.924,287.696,"But death, it would be appropriate to take account of death in determining whether it's a sentencing factor or an element."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,287.696,289.613,"--Well, we believe, and I believe--"
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.613,290.898,"I mean, for purposes of interpreting the statute--"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,290.898,291.632,--That's correct.
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.632,292.632,--death would be relevant.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,292.632,310.276,"I don't believe that the Gov... I think the Government and we agree that there's no distinction between serious bodily injury resulting, and death resulting, at least in terms of interpreting the statute, that they're either both elements of the offense or something of that nature, the opposite of a sentencing factor, or they are sentencing factors."
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,324.719,325.253,It has.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,331.559,332.209,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,336.943,337.962,That's pretty important.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,341.414,351.603,"--Well, I think that's the only time it was used, Your Honor, and as I read the opinion, and the Court made a point that it had never been used as an element of an offense where the conduct was already illegal."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.424,357.24,In Federal statutes?
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,357.24,358.39,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.39,361.376,"Talking about in the Federal criminal code, or--"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,361.376,364.594,"This was the point that the Court made, that Congress had not done that."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.594,365.863,--That Congress hadn't done it?
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,365.863,392.18,"Congress had not made recidivism a... that was the point the majority made twice, so we think that that's quite different here, because what you find is that Congress clearly has made serious bodily injury an element of several offenses which we have cited, and in fact that the States, who have traditionally dealt with robbery, have almost invariably treated serious bodily injury as an element of the offense, or at least something that must be pled and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt."
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.18,393.013,"I mean, I think you're absolutely right."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,420.413,421.397,I think--
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,421.397,424.901,Which is asking us to narrow Almendarez-Torres away and make it disappear.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,424.901,425.884,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.161,442.363,"Well, we've come a long way from Mullaney v. Wilbur."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,442.363,442.863,I think that's--
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.863,443.929,Patterson... yes.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,443.929,466.478,"--I think it has, Your Honor, and as I understand it the Court in McMillan has said if it is merely a fact which restrains the sentencer's discretion within the statutory range, that it need not go to a jury, and then in Almendarez-Torres the Court said, if it is a recidivist factor which increases the statutory range, it need not go to the jury."
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,467.028,489.308,"Let me ask you the question, I think in my own mind only... I'm only speaking for myself, but I would say that at the heart of this was... at least the thought in my own mind that since, let's say 1,000 years... that's an exaggeration... a couple of hundred years, we have statutes that define crimes, and we have judges that assert punishment under the statute."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,572.046,572.748,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,572.748,594.427,"That's what in my mind is lying at the heart of this and, of course, my answer in Almendarez-Torres is, except in extreme cases the Constitution does permit Congress and the Commission to regularize what previously happened silently, or without understanding, or... et cetera."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,597.196,616.241,"--I understand that, Your Honor, and I think it partly goes to what is the definition of a criminal offense and what conduct is ascribed to a violation of that, and I'd like to give you a example of, if what you say is correct, what could happen, and I don't... this was really... was envisioned by the dissenting justices in the Monge case."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.148,684.587,"Mr. Denvir, why do you accept Justice Breyer's hypothesis that this has been uniformly the practice in the past?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,686.087,688.873,"--Certainly, Your Honor, and--"
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.873,691.075,Which was a judge which would give the maximum.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,696.71,697.228,--It certainly did.
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.228,703.548,"So when you committed a particular crime, you knew that you ran a risk of getting the max."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,703.548,704.832,That's correct.
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.832,710.202,"Absolutely, depending on who... what judge happened to get your case, and that's not the case under these statutes, is it?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,710.202,730.783,"No, it isn't at all, and it raises the possibility in this case, for instance, if Mr. Jones had pled guilty to the carjacking as charged, and during the time between his guilty plea and sentencing the person had died, he would have just gone from 15 years to in this case a potential sentence of life imprisonment."
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.162,792.19,"Well, would our system be any better off if we went... if we repealed the Sentencing Guidelines and went back to the situation where the judges didn't say what they were taking into consideration, but two people would end up in Leavenworth convicted of the same crime, one was committed for 2 years and the other was committed for 20 years?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,803.581,817.222,"Well, Your Honor, I think that once again we are not challenging the fact that Congress can pick out particular factors that will restrict the sentencing authority's discretion within the statutory range."
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,836.302,837.485,But that was Almendarez-Torres.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,837.485,838.251,Your Honor--
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,838.251,846.341,"I mean, those were facts that were not proven in the crime-in-chief, and it increased the potential maximum sentence."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,846.341,855.011,"--They are facts of that nature, but I think what was pointed out in Almendarez-Torres is that the fact of a prior conviction first of all is not often disputed."
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,860.649,863.399,"Well, neither is it often disputed whether the victim died or didn't die."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,863.399,864.35,--Well--
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.35,865.783,"I mean, he did or he didn't."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,865.783,876.991,"--Well, it may be as to whether that death resulted from this crime, and certainly in a case like we have here there is certainly a substantial question as to whether this was serious bodily injury as defined by the statute."
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,892.468,899.357,"But not in a State, for example, where the sentencing is done by the judge, not the jury."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,912.714,926.507,"--And Your Honor, we have no quarrel with that, whether it's done under a sentencing guideline-type scheme, as we have in the Federal courts, or under another scheme, but the fact of the matter is, we're talking about the definition of the range of potential penalties."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.476,931.661,"It's optional for those judges, isn't it?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,940.351,941.301,"--They don't have to, and they--"
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.301,942.334,And they can still impose the minimum.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,942.334,943.886,"--Right, and they can determine--"
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.886,945.586,Whereas under this law they have no option.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,948.604,955.526,"--They are bound to look at an increased range of 25 years, based on that finding."
1998.97-6203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,955.526,965.149,"Well, so is your position that any time a judge is bound to make a particular minimum sentence, that the Constitution requires that to be shown as an element of the crime?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,965.149,983.678,"Again, Your Honor, I think that's the McMillan case, and the Court has said that if Congress or the legislator singles out a factor which will either control or guide the discretion of the sentencing authority within the statutory range of punishment, that that does not raise these concerns, but this is a different matter."
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,983.678,994.133,"Well, under this statute... under this statute if serious bodily injury results then the defendant will be sentenced to not more than 25 years."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,995.649,997.585,"It does not fix it at 20, but it exposes him."
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,997.585,1001.87,--It just exposes him to a broader range of discretion by the judge.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1001.87,1009.226,"Based on a factual finding that was not made by a jury, it was not made beyond a reasonable doubt, and it was not subject to the traditional safeguards."
1998.97-6203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1009.226,1029.27,"The same thing can in essence be true of a judge who says, well, I'm going to give a higher sentence because I happen to have determined on a preponderance that you've been previously convicted, or because the victim suffered serious injury, or because there was a very large quantity of drugs involved here."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1029.27,1041.696,"That's correct, Your Honor, and the only case that the Court has decided in that range is the recidivism question, and the Court selected certain factors about that that apparently were critical."
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1083.524,1089.594,Don't you think the defendant could suffer by having the fact of serious bodily injury or death being brought before the jury?
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1089.594,1102.651,"Your Honor, first of all, in the carjacking statute it is likely that will come in anyway, because the Government will try to use it to show that the taking was by force or... force and violence or by intimidation, so it's already going to go before the jury."
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1120.463,1125.098,If that's true with respect to bodily injury it's also true of a prior conviction.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1125.098,1140.94,"--It is, Your Honor, except for the fact that that's seldom disputed, and generally it has been found reliably in the past, where serious bodily injury is a brand-new issue and should be found under this higher standard by a more reliable fact-finder."
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.94,1148.363,But in the Old Chief case it was disputed as just what should be the form of presenting the prior conviction to the jury.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1148.363,1165.325,"That's correct, and there would be ways, perhaps under Old Chief or by seeking bifurcation, that a defendant who did not want this information to go before the jury could keep it out, if the Government was not already seeking to bring it in to show force and violence or intimidation, which are elements of the statute."
1998.97-6203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1165.325,1177.05,"Other than in the death penalty context, are you aware of any case where elements of the crime are bifurcated, and where the Constitution requires two trials?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1177.05,1184.369,"I'm not sure that the Constitution require, but I think a court would have that... the discretion to bifurcate it in the proper case."
1998.97-6203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.369,1185.821,Would you have special verdicts in this--
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1189.273,1190.09,With the prior convictions.
1998.97-6203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.392,1195.927,Would you have special verdicts under this statute under your reading?
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1195.927,1198.213,"--Your Honor, I don't believe it would require it."
1998.97-6203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.704,1213.806,"Well, then you submit alternate counts to the jury?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1213.806,1223.161,"It may be possible on any given case that you could have a lesser-included offense, which would be the simple case of carjacking, which happens in bank robbery statutes."
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1229.482,1234.802,"I mean, I've never heard of bifurcating a trial... maybe it exists... where it's an element of the offense, the injury."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1237.204,1237.738,--It has been done--
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.738,1238.54,--Okay.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1238.54,1239.59,--with prior convictions where--
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1239.59,1241.492,"Prior convictions, yes."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1241.492,1241.992,--That's correct.
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.992,1246.194,"--obviously, if this is an element of the offense, I don't know how you'd bifurcate it, but--"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1246.194,1246.494,That--
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.494,1247.277,--maybe you would.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1281.633,1282.233,--Certainly it does.
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1282.233,1282.985,--that there were systems like that?
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1283.469,1284.102,It's an indeterminate sentencing law.
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1284.102,1286.271,Now... now... an indeterminate sentencing.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1330.133,1331.166,I think--
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.166,1335.252,"How would I write that statute, in your opinion, that would be different from the way this one was written?"
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1335.252,1352.511,"--I think... I think if a statute was passed which provided that carjacking would control up to life, and if the statute also said that there was a determining, unless there was serious bodily injury, it couldn't be more than 15 years, and something of that nature, that would raise different questions than are presented here."
1998.97-6203,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1365.787,1368.306,"I'm... but what I didn't get, I'm not thinking of Almendarez-Torres."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1393.754,1414.668,"I think, as I say, I... to accomplish what you wanted, but it raises different questions in here, than the statute we have here, it could be provided that carjacking carries up to a life sentence, and that... but you cannot sentence for more than 15 years unless there's serious bodily injury, and you can't go for more than 25 years unless there is death resulting."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.12,1417.187,That would be okay?
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1417.187,1418.572,"--No, I don't think that would be okay."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.189,1422.708,I thought your answer was going to be that the legislature can't do that.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1422.708,1424.059,"--I don't think they can, Your Honor."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.059,1437.533,"The legislature, if it wants to leave it up to the judges, I mean, that's the price of having indeterminate sentences and allowing somebody to be sentenced anywhere from 1 year to life."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1445.739,1447.189,"That's our basic position, Your Honor."
1998.97-6203,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.189,1447.925,All you have to do--
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1447.925,1449.125,I was trying to respond to the California--
1998.97-6203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.125,1454.412,"--All you have to do is say, if you have an aggravating circumstance of that significance, you have to have it found by the jury."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1454.412,1455.095,--That--
1998.97-6203,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.095,1456.364,It's a very simple statute to write.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1462.685,1480.896,"--Well, our position is, the statute that's before this Court, which parallels, as I say, this section 247, takes this... takes certain factors and says to a defendant, if those factors are found to be true, then you will look at an additional 10 years, or perhaps all the way to life, or now, under the amendments, to death."
1998.97-6203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1490.768,1493.351,"Correct me if I'm wrong, and I may be wrong."
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1510.563,1511.23,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-6203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1531.426,1534.678,It seems to me necessarily you're going to want special verdicts and/or bifurcated trials.
1998.97-6203,0,38478,quin_denvir,,1534.678,1536.813,I really don't think special verdicts are required.
1998.97-6203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.907,1554.008,"Very well, Mr. Denvir."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1556.043,1561.262,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-6203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1624.605,1632.025,Are there due process limits at all on what Congress can treat as a sentencing factor as opposed to an element?
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1632.025,1637.678,"The Court has always suggested that there are such limits, and we don't oppose that."
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.758,1669.78,"This one reads pretty much like that to me, and what about the defacing of property statute that your colleague suggested?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1669.78,1670.899,"Well, I--"
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.899,1672.899,It's an offense of defacing property.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1672.899,1673.851,--I think that--
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.851,1676.386,"If nothing else happens, punished by 1 year."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1694.281,1704.036,"--Well, I think first of all that's in the civil rights sections of the statutes, the statutes intended to address defacement of religious property for the reasons of race or creed."
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.588,1708.254,So serious you get 1 year for it.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1708.254,1708.438,So--
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.438,1713.29,"Unless somebody dies, in which case you get life, and you don't get a jury trial as to whether anybody has died."
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.29,1716.175,"Yes, and you can commit it by just throwing a bucket of paint on a wall."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1717.777,1722.079,"--Well, that's right, but I think the fundamental question, then... and there are... one can multiply the examples here."
1998.97-6203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.761,1752.581,"It's the piling on of, you know, on top of a 1-year sentence a 20-year sentence."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1759.069,1759.435,--Well--
1998.97-6203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.435,1760.269,Which I don't think you have here.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1760.269,1769.175,"--We certainly don't have it here, and I think the question in those cases is always going to be, well, under a sort of proportionality analysis, could Congress pass this statute and simply say--"
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.175,1770.46,"It's really an Eighth Amendment issue, I guess."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1770.46,1774.677,"--it's defacement of property and the penalty is life, and as Justice Breyer was suggesting, leave it up to the judge."
1998.97-6203,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1790.004,1790.487,Mr. DuMont--
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1828.746,1829.262,--That's right.
1998.97-6203,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1829.262,1838.252,So you would have by a preponderance of the evidence 10 years added on for the rape by the judge.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1838.252,1851.578,"I think that's absolutely right, and I think it's important to point out that that's exactly what the result would be if this statute said, as it might very well, here are the elements, the penalty is life, now go to the guidelines, and Congress has, of course, mandated that district judges obey the guidelines."
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.578,1853.446,It wouldn't necessarily be that.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1882.431,1886.835,"Well, I think that is the interesting argument, and our answer to that is no."
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.062,1956.597,Can you tell us--
1998.97-6203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.654,1972.92,--How does this statute--
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.92,1981.26,"--that is open to discussion that that's prescribing the elements of the crime, but where you just leave it to the judge you have no control over it, or the sentencing."
1998.97-6203,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.26,1982.726,How does this statute require it?
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1988.914,1989.782,That's absolutely right.
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.622,2032.209,"May I ask, if the statute said it may increase... now it says if the judge makes such finding."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2050.237,2052.956,"It's a finding at sentencing, but by some very low standard."
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.956,2054.724,The judge does the sentencing.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2065.347,2067.882,I've two answers.
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.637,2076.737,"No, it's not an indeterminate system."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2084.206,2089.195,"--Well, I think the standard of proof at sentencing can raise a due process question, yes."
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2090.128,2094.349,You think the standard of preponderance of evidence is mandated by the Due Process Clause?
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2102.538,2104.288,--All the Court has ever said is--
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.288,2105.906,I know we have... what do you think about that?
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2108.19,2112.892,"--I think it would raise some concerns if you were allowed to sentence on the basis of suspicion, but on the other hand--"
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.892,2117.796,"The difference between suspicion and preponderance raises concerns, but the difference between preponderance and proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2117.796,2121.348,"--Well, and there are cases that say that clear and convincing evidence is a good place to stop in between."
1998.97-6203,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2123.116,2123.933,Is that an open question?
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2123.933,2125.349,That is an open question.
1998.97-6203,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2125.349,2135.555,"I mean, it's an open question whether this... whether you have to have, in the sentencing factor, a preponderance, clear and convincing, beyond reasonable doubt."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2137.524,2139.693,This Court has specifically reserved the question.
1998.97-6203,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.693,2146.679,"All right, and so is that a matter of constitutional law, a matter of guideline law, a matter of the statutes under the guideline... what is it a matter of?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2146.679,2148.298,It could be any.
1998.97-6203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.368,2158.754,"In McMillan, didn't we say a preponderance was enough on the facts of that case?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2158.754,2162.974,"Yes, absolutely, and that's always been the standard, and that is sufficient, and no one has tried to go below that, so--"
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.974,2184.555,"You see, my point is that when you use these indeterminate sentencing examples where the judge had total discretion, the judge then could act on ex parte submissions that were purely suspicion, and you're saying that because that was permissible in indeterminate sentencing, when you have a regular system with statutorily required increases, you can still follow the same basic principle."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2184.555,2185.555,--Well--
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.555,2186.423,It seems to me it doesn't follow at all.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2186.423,2189.958,--I think that is the logic of many of the sentencing cases.
1998.97-6203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2204.468,2212.139,"Can you tell me, what is your formulation for what must be submitted to the jury in a criminal case?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2212.139,2224.715,"Our formulation is that... and this is going to be a little unsatisfactory, but our formulation is that the elements of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each of the elements of the offense, as defined by the legislature, must be submitted to the jury."
1998.97-6203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2224.715,2236.872,"So you use the term elements, which is what your adversary uses, and it's just a question of our parsing the meaning of the term, elements?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2236.872,2247.378,"Well, I think not, because what the Court has said... and the case I would point you to in response to, I believe it was your first question of the afternoon, is perhaps Patterson v. New York, which does talk in these terms."
1998.97-6203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2287.705,2289.991,How do I know what's an element and what isn't an element?
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2289.991,2301.565,"--In the first instance you know it by looking at the statute and seeing what Congress or the State legislature has defined as an element, and in Congress' case that's particularly true, because of course there's no common law background to fall back on."
1998.97-6203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2302.648,2303.781,Only because Congress has never used the term element.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2306.183,2311.004,"--Well, it is done against a long practice, so I think what you have in the elements of offense is something like you have here."
1998.97-6203,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2335.969,2350.127,"--Is there any indication that Congress knew when it was drafting, say, the robbery statute as opposed to the carjacking, that in the one case it was robbery, the serious bodily injury would go to the jury, and the other, it would go to the judge?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2373.408,2386.152,"--Well, I think there has been something of a paradigm shift over the last 40 years if you want to look at the way statutes have developed, and I think we think slightly differently and more clearly now about some of these issues."
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.702,2388.368,"No jury trial now, right--"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2388.368,2390.27,--We're working on that.
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.27,2391.12,--as opposed to 40 years ago?
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2391.12,2391.654,We're working on that.
1998.97-6203,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2445.856,2453.676,"There's the question of the age of the statute, and you're saying, maybe if the bank robbery statute were passed today it would be just like the carjacking statute."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2453.676,2456.795,"--I think it might be written differently, that's all, or we would have a different indication."
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.905,2480.994,"Mr. DuMont, I assume if you have a... you know, a crime that has a 10-year penalty, 10 years in prison, now, that's serious enough that you need a jury trial, I assume."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2509.513,2511.299,I--
1998.97-6203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.299,2512.215,You don't know.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2538.782,2552.726,"--Well, I can appreciate that effort, but we would be trying to come up... if we went the other way, if we went back to a Mullaney system, then it seems to me we would be trying to come up in a long series of cases with some limits on this theory of, well then, what is going to be an element?"
1998.97-6203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2579.359,2592.417,"Well, you have a constitutional right to a jury trial to be... where the jury, not the judge, determines if a person is a bad man, but if the question is whether he's a very bad man, that goes to the judge?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2593.351,2598.988,"Well, you know, there are always... again, there are other constitutional principles that may supervene here."
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.994,2635.28,But you're opponent is arguing--
1998.97-6203,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2635.28,2641.267,"--I guess we're trying to ask for the rationale of the jury trial or guarantee, and then to square it with the results that we're asked to reach here."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2641.267,2656.276,"Well, I think the jury trial guarantee is a central guarantee which ensures that once Congress has defined an offense, you may not be punished for that offense until a jury of your peers has found that you have in fact engaged in conduct which satisfies each of the elements of that offense."
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.978,2664.863,"But you made the point, and your opponent made the same point, that one of the things at stake here is the notice."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2672.286,2674.921,"--Well, that's right, and that's exactly what would be true... I--"
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.921,2675.671,It seems to me that you--
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2675.671,2690.33,"--hate to keep coming back to this, but it is exactly what would be true if Congress had instead given less guidance in the statute, and had simply set a high maximum, which would have been perfectly appropriate for a very serious, violent crime like this, and then you'd have a lot of guidelines, mandatory guidelines under the Sentencing Commission's rules--"
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.33,2692.28,"--But, see, there are three things at issue."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2701.888,2707.709,"--Well, I think fair notice... fair notice of what you've been charged with and what the Government has to prove to convict you is certainly mandated, but here they--"
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.709,2712.244,"No, but all you have to be... you don't have to be... give notice that they claim you caused serious bodily harm."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2713.779,2718.398,"--No, nor do you have to give notice of any other sentencing factor in any normal case."
1998.97-6203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.988,2760.658,The defendant's attorney certainly has notice that this is going to be a factor considered at sentencing in a way that he might not at the other... in the old type of hearing.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2760.658,2765.129,"That's absolutely right, and there was no question here of any lack of notice at any stage of the--"
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.129,2768.831,How can you assume the defendant always knows what the Government thinks happened?
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2784.709,2786.009,"--Well, at sentencing--"
1998.97-6203,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.009,2786.909,That's what you said.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2786.909,2806.706,"--At sentencing the whole principle is that you know in advance if... under the current system you actually know in advance, much more than you traditionally did, what the factors that are relevant are going to be and, in this instance, a question of serious bodily injury did arise between indictment and the sentencing, and the defendant had notice of that at sentencing, there was a sentencing proceeding in which the defendant was free to contest that, and the judge made a finding."
1998.97-6203,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2811.11,2824.834,"In the facts of this very case, the magistrate judge told him he was facing 15 years, and it was a little confused because, do I understand correctly he was not the one who actually administered the blow, it was his codefendant?"
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2824.834,2827.136,I believe that's correct.
1998.97-6203,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2827.136,2833.956,So here was a magistrate judge who didn't accurately notify the defendant of what he faced.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2836.308,2837.208,"That's true, and I misspoke."
1998.97-6203,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2868.363,2870.315,So ultimately there's no notice.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2876.802,2877.235,That's right.
1998.97-6203,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2877.235,2877.685,All right.
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2905.036,2905.988,Correct.
1998.97-6203,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.988,2913.908,"And everybody seems to think there's some limit on that, and I take it you don't have a clear idea of how to phrase what that limit is."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2916.61,2920.212,"Well, the Court has given a variety of clues along the way."
1998.97-6203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2994.296,2995.429,"Mm-hmm, thanks."
1998.97-6203,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2995.429,2999.498,"If the Court has no further questions, thank you."
1998.97-6203,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.498,3000.2,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
1998.97-6203,2,38478,quin_denvir,,3002.266,3003.985,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.97-6203,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3175.964,3177.232,"Thank you, Mr. Denvir."
