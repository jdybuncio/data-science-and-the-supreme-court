1995.94-1654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.368,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1654, The Board of County Commissioners of Wabaunsee County, Kansas, v. Keen Umbehr."
1995.94-1654,0,21369,donald_patterson,,15.601,18.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,48.854,54.497,"Mr. Patterson, it's not a case involving any issue of political patronage, is it?"
1995.94-1654,0,21369,donald_patterson,,54.497,55.259,"No, it is not."
1995.94-1654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.124,63.683,It's a free speech case--
1995.94-1654,0,21369,donald_patterson,,63.683,64.263,Exactly.
1995.94-1654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.263,66.496,--In the context of an independent contractor.
1995.94-1654,0,21369,donald_patterson,,66.496,67.006,Exactly.
1995.94-1654,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.006,67.878,With the county.
1995.94-1654,0,21369,donald_patterson,,67.878,69.207,That's exactly what it is.
1995.94-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,69.207,74.61,I thought our patronage cases were decided as free speech cases under the First Amendment.
1995.94-1654,0,21369,donald_patterson,,77.054,78.874,I think they were.
1995.94-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.486,93.383,"Well, I understand that the free speech in question was not free speech regarding partisan politics, but why would that make any difference?"
1995.94-1654,0,21369,donald_patterson,,98.436,102.82,"They are a form of First Amendment case, and probably not."
1995.94-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.91,123.714,"So you think we could hold for you in this case, but in a later case where the contractor says, I don't like Republicans, we... and I'm going to vote Democratic, we could allow that contract to be denied, because after all, the speech in this case is partisan political speech and it's okay to discriminate against that."
1995.94-1654,0,21369,donald_patterson,,123.714,135.382,"--It depends upon how the contour of the First Amendment right is defined in terms of the language of the First Amendment, which uses the word, abridging."
1995.94-1654,1,39637,robert_a_van_kirk,,1703.18,1710.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1763.391,1764.042,May I just interrupt?
1995.94-1654,1,39637,robert_a_van_kirk,,1766.552,1773.017,"--On the first point there actually is no principal case, it is a entire string of unconstitutional condition cases that this Court--"
1995.94-1654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.017,1774.967,But name one involving a government contractor.
1995.94-1654,1,39637,robert_a_van_kirk,,1774.967,1787.055,"--Lefkowitz v. Turley, Your Honor, in which in the Fifth Amendment context this Court recognized that the Government could not ask the independent contractor to forfeit their right against self incrimination as a--"
1995.94-1654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.055,1791.539,Do you have a case involving a government contractor and the First Amendment--
1995.94-1654,1,39637,robert_a_van_kirk,,1791.539,1792.649,--There--
1995.94-1654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1792.649,1795.832,--in this wide range that you describe so categorically?
1995.94-1654,1,39637,robert_a_van_kirk,,1796.312,1801.737,--It depends on if you view the employment cases involving contracts as independent contractors.
1995.94-1654,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.737,1802.267,Do you have one involving--
1995.94-1654,1,39637,robert_a_van_kirk,,1802.267,1802.757,No.
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2870.981,2879.066,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1654,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2907.747,2914.079,"But aren't they also in a unique position in the hypothetical that I gave, and like Justice Scalia's hypothetical with the contract guards?"
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2927.339,2933.183,"--Well, Your Honor, we believe that content neutral time, place, and manner restrictions could certainly be placed on employees."
1995.94-1654,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2936.735,2946.27,"Suppose they say, we don't want you discussing any matters of public concern because you have a special privilege, going in to homes, that we are giving you, and we do not want you to exercise that on our behalf?"
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2946.27,2955.806,"--Your Honor, we believe that the Government certainly would have a right to terminate a contract if that provision was necessary to the effective performance of the contract."
1995.94-1654,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2955.806,2958.558,"No, I will stipulate that out of the hypothetical."
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2958.558,2964.682,"If it was content based, we don't believe that that is the kind of action that the Government can take."
1995.94-1654,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2964.682,2968.616,What if the Government... and I think this is the direction Justice Kennedy was going in.
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2983.846,2991.169,"Your Honor, we think that the Government has the right to put terms in the contract that are necessary to its effective performance."
1995.94-1654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2991.169,2993.6,That's not an answer to Justice Souter's question.
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3000.145,3007.412,We believe that because of the content based nature of it there would have to be some kind of stronger Government interest.
1995.94-1654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.412,3009.262,What's content based about that?
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3012.264,3014.736,"I guess it's how you define politics, Your Honor."
1995.94-1654,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3023.642,3029.976,"But in any case, that is for the... even if... let's add another term to the contract."
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3045.937,3052.693,If it were limited to one topic we think that would raise problems of content based regulation.
1995.94-1654,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3052.693,3053.674,Suppose it would limit--
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3064.279,3065.021,Your Honor--
1995.94-1654,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.021,3068.314,"Assuming it's making no speech restrictions, the Government can't say we'd rather have the Boy Scouts do it?"
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3068.314,3072.317,"--I think that it really depends on the contract we're talking about, Your Honor."
1995.94-1654,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.317,3079.082,"It's a contract to pick up garbage, and we know that there's going to be a lot of political discussion, okay."
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3081.953,3087.517,"Yes, Your Honor, unless there's a--"
1995.94-1654,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.517,3088.128,That's what you're saying.
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3098.446,3102.827,"--If the contract is to communicate the Government's speech, certainly, and if--"
1995.94-1654,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.827,3103.448,"No, the contract isn't that."
1995.94-1654,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3113.266,3115.747,--No.
