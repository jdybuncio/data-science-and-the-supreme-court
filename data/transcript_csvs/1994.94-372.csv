1994.94-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.237,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-372, Donna E. Shalala v. Margaret Whitecotton."
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,13.641,15.771,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-372,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.847,281.154,"Mr. Gornstein, if we had only the language that was in that table and not the statutory language, wouldn't there be more of a case for the opposite interpretation?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,281.154,290.561,"Justice Ginsburg, I think even if we were just looking at that table language, and that appears, by the way, at page 4 of our brief, and says,"
1994.94-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.292,388.414,"Isn't the term ""first"" somewhat superfluous with the term ""onset""?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,388.414,394.269,"Well, I think you have the first symptom or manifestation of onset, or significant aggravation."
1994.94-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.269,396.92,"So first doesn't modify onset, in your view?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,396.92,406.677,"I think it... it does modify onset, yes, but I think it's just first symptom or manifest... it's somewhat superfluous, I would agree, but I think it makes it more clear."
1994.94-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.613,466.818,"Mr. Gornstein, if we were to agree with you on the interpretation of the statute as to question 1 in the cert petition, do we need to reach the question of the standards under question 2, as posed in the cert position?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,466.818,467.625,You do not.
1994.94-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,480.666,494.003,The respondent spends a good deal of time discussing how the district court might have reached the wrong conclusion on the facts here.
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,498.427,500.688,We would agree that those matters are open on remand.
1994.94-372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.911,506.652,I have one.
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,508.943,523.673,"--The first symptom or manifestation was the abnormally small head size at birth, which was... the special master found was a positive indication that this child was... already had a very serious brain injury."
1994.94-372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,544.667,556.704,"Is there any question in the record, just as an evidentiary matter, that the head size can be treated as a cause of the brain injury?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,556.704,585.585,"I would say it's not the head size that's the cause, it is the abnormally small brain that is the cause of the injury, and it is the abnormally small head size that tells you you have an abnormally small brain, and sometimes the term microcephaly is used to refer to both of those things, but what you have is an abnormally small head size that tells you you have an abnormally small brain, and that's what the special master found."
1994.94-372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.585,589.236,So there's no question about the evidentiary basis for that relationship.
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,589.236,589.737,No.
1994.94-372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.737,594.429,"If we therefore reverse, there's not going to be a fight over what the evidence shows."
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,594.429,610.35,"Well, the other side may have a different view on whether the kind of... the head size here was sufficiently indicative of an abnormally small brain, the kind of abnormally small brain that would result in the conditions, and that was the dispute that was had at trial."
1994.94-372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,624.228,626.88,You say there's no question about the evidentiary basis for that finding.
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,626.88,629.952,I think that's clearly supportable in the evidence.
1994.94-372,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,644.942,665.208,"Is the difference in the two briefs... you refer to a scientific term, and the plaintiffs refer to small head, not conceding that that was any kind of symptom of any malady."
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,667.007,692.714,"I think that's the factual dispute, that the head... they would agree, I believe, that at some point the head size is so small as to let you know that there is a real problem and that brain injury has already occurred, but they'll have to speak for themselves on that issue, but I think what they would say is, it wasn't small enough, and that the special master heard conflicting evidence about that and concluded that it was."
1994.94-372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.622,736.502,"--Well, let me ask you, and perhaps this will bring you to your second point, was it the hearing examiner's theory... is it the Government's theory that the ultimate condition, the encephalopathy, was related to the microcephaly?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,736.502,758.847,"Yes, that's right, that the abnormally small brain led to the difficulties that this child later experienced in life, including mental retardation, and cerebral palsy, that these are, in fact, children with microcephaly, over 90 percent turn out to have... are mentally retarded."
1994.94-372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.279,764.631,And is that the reason... or perhaps there are other reasons.
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,768.886,779.161,The reason that the ultimate condition is nonidiopathic is that we take a different view of what that term means than did the court of appeals.
1994.94-372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,830.705,841.291,"So are you saying that you can concede that the microcephaly is idiopathic, in the sense that we don't know what caused it, but that you still prevail in this case?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,841.291,852.08,"That's right, because I think idiopathic within the meaning of this statute simply... it describes a situation where the Secretary says, I have no... the vaccine couldn't have caused it."
1994.94-372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,866.189,869.681,"So idiopathic depends on the question we're asking, I take it."
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,869.681,893.297,"That's exactly right, and I think that to resolve that ambiguity I think you should go back to the core language in section 300aa-13, which says that the Secretary... (b), that shows that the Secretary can rebut the presumption of causation by showing that the child's condition is due to factors unrelated to the administration of that vaccine."
1994.94-372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.952,956.887,"Does the medical profession use the word, idiopathic, in the same sense that we're using it here, relative depending on which question we're asking?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,956.887,957.508,I think that's right.
1994.94-372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,968.397,993.392,"Does your under... does sense of idiopathic, as you are saying the statute uses it, broad enough to cover this situation: is a condition idiopathic when that condition is part of a recognized disease, in and of itself, although we don't know what causes the disease?"
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1028.515,1032.127,As long as you could show that the Alzheimer's preexisted the--
1994.94-372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1032.127,1032.637,Yes.
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1032.637,1034.858,"--the administration of the vaccine, yes, because--"
1994.94-372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1034.858,1048.079,"So nothing is idiopathic, then, I guess, if it is a condition which is sort of a recognized set of symptoms or conditions within normal diagnostic practice."
1994.94-372,0,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1048.079,1051.231,"--That's right, and cancer would be a good example."
1994.94-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.86,1128.422,"Very well, Mr. Gornstein."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1130.343,1136.467,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-372,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1221.715,1236.124,"Isn't that a matter, counsel, for medical judgment, and weren't there expert witnesses who testified that that was a manifestation, or symptom, of the ultimate disability?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1236.124,1245.789,"Correctly stated, no medical authority would consider it to be a symptom."
1994.94-372,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1257.857,1260.0,"Well, what did the experts who testified in this case call it?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1260.0,1268.696,"I cannot recall, Your Honor, that experts ever called it a symptom, as such."
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1325.18,1326.051,Are they exclusive?
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1327.623,1330.936,"--They are not exclusive, but I don't believe--"
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.936,1334.747,So what difference does it here whether it's called a symptom or anything else?
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1347.997,1348.718,--That is correct--
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.718,1356.772,"--but that there was that pathological condition before the vaccine was administered, and that's what needs to be proven, isn't it?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1356.772,1372.451,"--Well, what we believe this Court should do is articulate a rule which will guide us in our practice, and we believe the enforcement of the plain language of the statute sets forth a sequence of analysis that must be performed."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.895,1424.226,"But that wasn't the basis for the court of appeals ruling, was it?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1424.226,1430.371,"In a very strong sense, Your Honor, I believe it is."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.371,1438.228,"Well, the court of appeals... I understood the court of appeals to leave the findings of the special master undisturbed."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1438.228,1451.077,"I agree that that happened, although the special master did violence to the statute, and the court of appeals was able to determine the case in that... because of that legal error."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.394,1467.917,Are you defending the reasoning of the court of appeals here?
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1467.917,1468.867,"--Oh, very much so, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1468.867,1479.375,"Well, but since the court of appeals dealt virtually not at all with the findings of the special master, I don't see why you should concentrate on the findings of the special master, then."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1479.375,1490.412,"Oh, I don't so much focus on the findings, Your Honor, as the process which the special master went through, and the special master skipped over the finding of the table injury."
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.18,1565.712,"Well, let's look at (a)(1)(A)."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1577.148,1585.473,11(c)(1) is the statute found at page 4 of the petitioner's brief.
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.096,1596.4,"The bottom of page 4, Vaccine Injury Table, is that what you're talking about?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1596.4,1598.703,"--No, it... the requirements of the petition."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.05,1612.272,"Where are you reading from, Mr. Moxley?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1612.272,1622.288,"I... the statute is on page 3, I'm sorry."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.288,1623.438,Page 3--
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1623.438,1624.639,Of the petitioner's brief.
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.639,1625.288,"--of the petitioner's brief, thank you."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1625.288,1630.264,Page 2.
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.747,1664.604,"And it goes on, and the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or of the significant aggravation of any such illness, disability, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1664.604,1665.055,--Yes.
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.485,1666.846,Don't leave that out.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1668.308,1670.659,"--Well, the thing that... I agree, yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.528,1685.8,"Well, but that's the debate."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1686.18,1687.71,"Well, the special master--"
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.71,1692.524,--you simply just can't say that the special master ignored that provision.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1692.524,1705.511,"--The special master found, Your Honor, that the child technically, ""technically"" satisfied the provisions of the table with regard to a residual seizure disorder."
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.585,1709.775,But--
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1709.775,1715.018,That has to be the onset of a significant aggravation.
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.627,1729.177,--But the illness is not the seizure.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1738.232,1740.736,"The encephalopathy, the acute encephalopathy--"
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.736,1741.274,--All right.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1741.274,1742.456,"--was the injury, Your Honor, yes."
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.456,1757.807,"All right, and what this requires is that the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or of the significant aggravation of the illness have occurred within the period after the vaccine--"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1757.807,1758.726,"Yes, Your Honor, but--"
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.726,1759.127,--was administered.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1759.127,1760.389,--A residual seizure disorder--
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.389,1761.09,And that's what the debate is about.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1761.09,1774.901,"--A residual seizure disorder is a table injury and it is a specific table injury, and it is a specific species of table injury, and it's also the most specific well-known species of vaccine injury."
1994.94-372,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1774.901,1788.459,"But counsel, the special master found that the child had not, in fact, suffered a residual seizure disorder, and you didn't petition for cert on that."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1798.416,1812.425,"Your Honor, I believe the CA Fed recognized that the seizure, under the statute, was clearly the onset, the first onset of symptomatic encephalopathy, and I believe that's a correct holding."
1994.94-372,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1812.425,1822.392,"Yes, but you were just arguing this residual seizure disorder point, and I understood that that issue was not here."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1827.704,1834.71,The special master did say that the child suffered a residual seizure disorder.
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.966,1879.139,Did the special master hear medical evidence?
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1879.139,1881.811,"The special master did, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.337,1913.861,"But to repeat Justice O'Connor's point, my impression was the findings simply are not here."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1913.861,1916.082,--I agree that we're not arguing--
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.082,1918.143,But you keep criticizing them.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1918.143,1921.045,"--I understand that, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1924.768,1937.407,"You agree, I take it, that there can be different kinds of symptoms evidencing the same cause, right, evidencing the same disease."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1940.169,1941.549,"--Many manifestations, yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1941.549,1949.214,"Now, suppose that a symptom of encephalopathy occurred before the administration of the vaccine."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1949.214,1950.914,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1950.914,1955.048,"The presumption would not be satisfied then, would it?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1955.048,1958.441,"I... no, I don't agree with that, Your Honor, because--"
1994.94-372,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1958.441,1958.691,All right.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1960.651,1961.042,--Yes.
1994.94-372,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.352,1968.907,"And I think it would assist the Court if you would argue that point, because that's where you're in disagreement with the Government, and that's why the case is here."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,1968.907,1969.638,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.741,2046.087,"Well, it's necessary to satisfy the burden, but it's not sufficient to satisfy the burden, because you've also got to show that it was... that these symptoms were the manifestations, the first manifestations of the onset of the disease, and that in and of itself doesn't follow merely from introducing evidence that after the vaccination the symptoms occurred."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2047.429,2050.911,"I don't exactly agree with that, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2098.143,2116.134,"Well, they may not be typical, but if in fact the evidence is that they were caused, and you don't also introduce some evidence to the effect that there was no other manifestation of the disease prior to vaccination, you haven't touched all the bases required in the statute, have you?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2116.134,2122.409,I believe that... I believe it gets back to 13(a)(2)(A).
1994.94-372,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2122.409,2124.882,"Well, what's the answer to my question first?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2124.882,2129.735,The answer is that there was... that microcephaly is not a disease.
1994.94-372,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2145.715,2150.739,"Well, no one is claiming in this case that microcephaly is itself the disease."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2153.53,2154.88,I believe the Government has.
1994.94-372,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2154.88,2157.912,--but I don't think that responds either to the Government's position or to my question.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2157.912,2161.385,"I believe, Your Honor--"
1994.94-372,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2161.385,2170.441,"I thought the disease was encephalopathy, and the Government is simply saying that... well, I... strike what the Government is saying."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2197.959,2205.475,--I don't believe that it has to be the first symptom in a significant aggravation case.
1994.94-372,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.825,2222.516,Let's say it's not a... let's leave aside the aggravation point.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2237.675,2242.989,"--That is correct for what we call an onset case, Your Honor, yes."
1994.94-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.43,2248.642,"Your position is that this is an aggravation case, is that correct?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2248.642,2255.408,Our position is that this case satisfies the table presumption for significant aggravation.
1994.94-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2255.408,2283.146,"So that if I understand you correctly that even though there might have been a symptom of the disease before the vaccination, therefore it's not... therefore what happened after the vaccination is not the first symptom of the onset, nevertheless, I understand your position, there could be a serious aggravation caused by the vaccine, and the first symptom of that was the seizure within 3 days."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2283.146,2284.767,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.909,2289.729,"So that if there... but that's not the theory of the court of appeals, or am I right on that?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2289.729,2292.492,"--Well, it's both."
1994.94-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.133,2307.701,You make two arguments.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2310.055,2310.682,Yes.
1994.94-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.682,2311.654,That's one of your arguments.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2320.92,2322.231,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.231,2322.811,So you have two alternative arguments.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2322.811,2323.492,That is correct.
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.492,2328.635,What did the finder of fact conclude as to that?
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2328.635,2329.536,The finder--
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.536,2331.497,"I mean, surely that's a factual question."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2331.497,2341.375,"--The finder of fact found that we technically fit the table, but that maybe Congress did not intend for the table to be literally applied."
1994.94-372,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.375,2347.659,Can you point to the words in the finder of fact's findings that say what you've just summarized?
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2347.659,2348.748,There is a footnote.
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.704,2442.4,"If you need a rule, I mean, I thought this case came here on a slightly different theory."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2467.917,2469.058,It doesn't--
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2469.058,2499.799,"You were not able, in that situation, to show what, I guess, the statute here in 11(c) requires, that you have to show that... what are the exact words, that the first symptom or manifestation of the injury or the aggravation occurred within 3 days after the DPT vaccine."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2499.799,2500.448,"--I agree, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.448,2504.642,And yet the Fed Circuit seemed not to do that simple thing.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2533.022,2534.461,You are.
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2534.461,2536.702,"If not, explain why I'm not."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2537.984,2540.095,The thing that would have to be--
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.095,2540.686,I'd like to be right.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2540.686,2541.277,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.388,2545.909,Yes.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2545.909,2557.615,--in order for us to satisfy our case to show... our burden to show a table case would be for that seizure after the shot to be the first of weekly seizures.
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2557.615,2559.827,There'd have to be some change.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2564.791,2566.772,"I believe so, yes."
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2566.772,2576.049,"And so then the question is, was it somehow an aggravation, a symptom of a significant aggravation, the first symptom of a significant aggravation--"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2576.049,2576.68,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2576.68,2589.797,"--and if so, the statute seems to say, if it's the first symptom of the significant aggravation... that's what... the words it uses, then, if you show that, you prevail, but then what's the legal argument?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2605.498,2608.41,"Your Honor, in the... there's a legal standard there that's implicit."
1994.94-372,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2653.911,2667.098,"Well, what the statute says, the statute says that you, the petitioner, have to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence matters in the petition, in 300aa(11)(c)(1)."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2684.849,2692.483,"--Well, the first symptom does not require a showing that the child was normal."

1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.186,2741.777,"Well, give me another page."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2741.777,2744.019,That is the--
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.019,2746.941,I don't find a mention of aggravation on page 27.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2746.941,2747.391,--I agree.
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2748.122,2752.063,"Well then, why did you cite that page in response to Justice Ginsburg's question?"
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2752.063,2760.928,"--I believe that she was asking me if I was... if I could point out whether or not the Court had addressed the issue of a table injury, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.928,2762.5,I thought it was aggravation.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2762.5,2763.8,I believe that--
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.8,2764.992,"Well, I'll ask you."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2773.519,2798.785,"--The finder of fact used the Massoci test as articulated... as ostensibly argued in my brief, which was to compare the ultimate condition of the speculative... compare the ultimate condition to the outcome from the speculative organic brain syndrome."

1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2825.773,2826.224,No.
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.516,2829.907,Ah.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2829.907,2832.528,--of that same... in that same opinion.
1994.94-372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.528,2833.219,All right.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2833.219,2848.389,A comparison of the condition prior to the administration of the vaccine and an exercise of deciding whether or not that condition was consistent with the current condition.
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2857.325,2862.568,Where on 36a does the special master talk factually about aggravation?
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2862.568,2866.411,--I don't believe the special master did.
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.731,2872.375,Did the special master anywhere make any factual finding that there was an aggravation?
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2873.665,2875.798,--No.
1994.94-372,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2897.039,2903.685,"Mr. Moxley, in answer to the question that was asked, I think that there was something the fact-finder said."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2921.696,2924.187,"--I agree, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.801,2934.465,"Mr. Moxley, we've been questioning you several times about findings of aggravation."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2948.345,2949.286,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2950.184,2950.735,"Well, you should be."
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2950.735,2951.947,--I don't mean to confuse the Court.

1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.058,2969.909,Your time has expired.
1994.94-372,1,39966,robert_thomas_moxley,,2969.909,2971.108,--aggravation as a matter of law.
1994.94-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.749,2975.322,"Mr. Gornstein, you have 11 minutes remaining."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2975.322,2983.667,Just two ouick points.
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.541,3008.293,"It is correct, is it not, that your opponent does rely in part on it being an aggravation case?"
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3008.293,3014.138,"Yes, and I was going to say that the special master found that there was no significant aggravation."
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.121,3025.487,"The theory of the special master was, you compare the condition at the time of the vaccination with the condition in the long run, as I understand it."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3025.487,3027.227,I would say that that wa part of the analysis.
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3027.227,3033.05,"And your opponent's argument is that the seizure itself was an aggravation, isn't that right?"
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3033.05,3034.292,"That's their theory, and I--"
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.292,3039.135,And that's what the table... that's the theory of the table under his view of the statute.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3039.135,3067.926,"--His theory was that the seizure was the manifestation of a significant aggravation, and the special master addressed that and said that it wasn't because the seizures were very brief and transient, that after the seizures in the table period, that the child returned to her prevaccine neurological status, that she continued to progress at the basically kind of slow but sure pace, and that she ultimately--"
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.926,3072.197,Is it correct that the seizure... as to the first seizure the child had?
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3072.197,3074.458,"--That is the first seizure the child had, yes."
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.458,3082.736,So at least there's an argument that hasn't been resolved by the courts below as to whether that might itself satisfy the requirements of the table.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3082.736,3086.526,"Well, two of the three courts below resolved it, but the court of appeals did not."
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.526,3086.987,Right.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3086.987,3091.311,"I would say the special master in the Court of Federal Claims, and that issue is open on remand--"
1994.94-372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3091.311,3091.712,Yes.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3154.843,3157.205,--I'm not sure I follow the hypothetical.
1994.94-372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3157.205,3166.712,"Well, I mean, there's a mysterious idiopathic cause, some weird thing, and the Government wants to say, this weird thing is the cause."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3166.712,3167.282,Okay.
1994.94-372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3167.62,3172.435,"Now, they're forbidden by the statute to bring that up, but they might say, wait a minute, there was a first symptom."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3174.786,3176.058,"--Well, I think--"
1994.94-372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3176.058,3177.488,--even before.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3177.488,3181.139,"--Well, I think there has to be medical evidence that--"
1994.94-372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3181.139,3181.72,"Yes, there is."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3183.341,3201.834,"--to say that that is a manifestation of encephalopathy, and if that's true, then the child has not demonstrated the prima facie case, and then you turn to the question of significant aggravation, and you look to see whether the seizure is a manifestation of something that, a marked change in the condition for the worse."
1994.94-372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3201.834,3206.105,"--You could bring that in even with the weird, mysterious, idiopathic mystery disease?"
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3216.643,3232.983,"You could, but I'm not sure I see what the problem with that is, when the statute, the terms of the statute say that the claimant has to show that the first symptom or manifestation of encephalopathy occurred after a vaccine administration."
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3259.55,3260.862,May I--
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3300.646,3306.781,"I think that what the statute says is it has to be a manifestation of a significant aggravation, which means--"
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3306.781,3307.612,"No, it has to be a symptom."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3307.612,3310.794,--A manifestation of a significant aggravation.
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3310.794,3311.295,Right.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3311.295,3314.888,And the... but the significant aggravation is defined--
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.888,3320.96,"It's a symptom or a... a first symptom or manifestation, or of the significant aggravation."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3328.647,3361.418,"--If it was a... if someone could say, testify, based on that manifestation, that that was a manifestation of a marked deterioration in the child's condition, because significant aggravation is defined on page 6 of our brief, 300aa(33)(4), the term significant aggravation means any change for the worse in a preexisting condition which results in markedly greater disability, pain, or illness, accompanied by substantial deterioration of health."
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.829,3404.566,"It seems to me if they're a symptom, that's all the statute requires, and that's what you're opponent argues here in his alternative theory."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3404.566,3406.528,On significant aggravation?
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3406.528,3407.196,Yes.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3407.196,3412.951,"Well, I think it has to... I would repeat my argument that it's not enough for it to be a symptom."
1994.94-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3417.966,3423.207,"But manifestation is in the dysjunctive, compared to symptom, symptom or manifestation."
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3423.207,3426.71,"That's right, and it was... the special master found it was neither in this case."
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3426.71,3430.581,My I try out two alternatives--
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3430.581,3430.982,Sure.
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3430.982,3432.674,--to see if I understand your position.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3574.097,3578.739,"Justice Souter, I'm not sure I agree with that description."
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3578.739,3579.15,Okay.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3579.801,3595.28,"I think that as long... in the first case, even if you don't know what caused it, if you can say, this is a manifestation of encephalopathy, and that is the table condition that the claimant is seeking compensation for, and the person doesn't know exactly--"
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3595.28,3596.971,"Well, you mean, even if you don't know what causes encephalopathy--"
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3596.971,3597.372,--That's right.
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3597.372,3600.924,--but there is always seizures that go with encephalopathy--
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3600.924,3601.425,But that--
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3601.425,3604.848,--and you have evidence of preexisting encephalopathy.
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3605.306,3615.664,"--But that's the key, is encephalopathy, because that's what the table says you can recover for, either the onset of encephalopathy, or a significant aggravation of encephalopathy."
1994.94-372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3660.574,3666.858,What about the residual seizure disorder point?
1994.94-372,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3672.761,3673.29,That's right.
1994.94-372,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3688.353,3689.686,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
