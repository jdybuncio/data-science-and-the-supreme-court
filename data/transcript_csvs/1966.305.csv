1966.305,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.643,"Number 305 Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company et al., Appellants versus United States et al."
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,34.892,38.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,176.698,188.995,"I beg your pardon, did the Commission make any findings as to competitive affect regardless of the statutory parameters?"
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,188.995,197.622,I think the Commission made no findings with respect to competitive effect although I do think that the Commission made some findings with respect to acquisition of control.
1966.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,200.306,217.814,"I've had some difficulty reading these papers with respect to clarifying now and understanding on that point, but you do think that the Commission did not make any findings as to competitive effect which would --"
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,217.814,218.115,I think it may --
1966.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,218.115,230.59,-– mean that I suppose that the Commission thought that the public interest standard in Section 20 does not require a finding as to competitive effect.
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,230.59,248.318,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas I am sure you know that one of our issues here is a Chenery issue, a question of the ambiguity of the Commission's order and I must say that I am really quite at a loss in answering the question as to what the Commission felt here because I just can't tell."
1966.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,288.898,307.568,"Do you understand I am making, in this question I am making a distinction between Section 7 Section 5 on the one hand and the factor of competitive effect on the other hand as arguably part of the public interest standard."
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,307.568,328.966,"Yes I do Mr. Justice Fortas now with respect to the question of the competitive impact the Commission does say on page 200 of the record, it further appearing that intervener's opposition is directed to the possibility of control of applicant by Greyhound and to the anticipated combination and correlation of certain of their facilities and services."
1966.305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,367.759,370.962,Where do you take to be in such a finding?
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,370.962,372.82,I just can't say Mr. Justice Stewart.
1966.305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.523,385.828,I see page 201.
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,385.828,393.489,Page 201 right on top and that concludes I think the thought that they introduced in the preceding paragraph.
1966.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,770.141,778.863,Is there any explanation why they did that rather than settling it at the same time?
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,778.863,784.922,Mr. Justice Fortas this is a point that we have raised from the time the litigation commenced in the district Court.
1966.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,784.922,787.063,"It sounds, it sounds rather peculiar."
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,787.063,793.413,"Well, I am willing to adopt that characterization of it."
1966.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,842.569,848.541,I suppose your point is that one cannot help taking back that it cannot loan?
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,848.541,853.72,"[Attempt to Laughter] Yes, that's right Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,951.425,960.652,Do you or do you not take the position that the public interest standard in Section 20 includes competitive effect?
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,960.652,960.85,Oh!
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.606,1022.901,Mr. Dempsey does the -- let's assume for the moment that none of the – that no control problems ever developed here.
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1048.469,1050.014,No if I understand your question correctly --
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.014,1061.971,I mean let's just assume there's only a 20% acquisition under 20a do you understand the government to say that there never is a Section 7 problem here?
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1061.971,1067.625,I do not understand them to say that anymore in their motion to affirm.
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.56,1074.165,"So the government says including now, and I'm talking about the about the Commission --"
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1074.165,1074.593,Yes.
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.593,1090.716,"The government says now that at some point Section 7 issues – that the Section 7 issue, anticompetitive issue does have to be faced up too even though it is only a 20% acquisition which doesn't represent a control problem under 5?"
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1090.716,1093.989,Yes.
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.014,1118.046,Can be put off?
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1118.046,1120.598,"Can be put off, right."
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.927,1139.201,So you think you and the government are now together in terms of the Section 7 or on anticompetitive impact is an issue under 20a?
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1139.201,1143.003,Mr. Justice White I -- is an issue under 20a?
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.48,1146.095,"Well, I know."
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1148.495,1150.563,Yes.
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.563,1158.326,I thought you just agreed with that the government now -- now agree that Section 7 was an issue --
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1158.326,1167.475,"It is an issue under Section 11 of the Clayton Act, not under Section 20, as I understand their position."
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.475,1170.629,"Well it does right, but it does have to taken into consideration --"
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1170.629,1171.567,"Well, if I could put it."
1966.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.567,1176.198,-– to prove the acquisition to court at some point in connection with the acquisition.
1966.305,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1176.198,1180.902,I think that the United States and I are in accord on that.
1966.305,1,29010,justice_bernnan,,1182.034,1183.805,By the United States –-
1966.305,2,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1183.805,1184.693,Excuse me Mr. Justice --
1966.305,3,29010,justice_bernnan,,1184.693,1186.152,Who are the United States?
1966.305,4,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1186.152,1186.73,Who are?
1966.305,5,29010,justice_bernnan,,1186.73,1188.67,I mean anti-trust --
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1188.67,1191.262,That would be my judgment on it.
1966.305,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.282,1228.613,"Well, the counsel for the Commission is on this brief that you simply accept this brief, the Commission brief or the --"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1228.613,1228.759,Oh!
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1242.533,1256.801,"The Department of Justice, including the antitrust division, and the Interstate Commerce Commission are walking, marching arm-in-arm, hand-in-hand at this stage of this case, isn't that right?"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1256.801,1257.859,I think so.
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1257.859,1262.689,At least they have filed a brief here stating the position of both?
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1262.689,1264.002,"Right, yes I didn't want to suggest --"
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1264.002,1280.852,"And the -- at the beginning of the case, the antitrust division of the Department of Justice opposed this acquisition, is that correct?"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1280.852,1281.679,That is correct.
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1281.679,1289.155,And somewhere along the line the Department had a second thought and changed its position?
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1289.155,1290.892,That's correct.
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1290.892,1319.417,"So they now both take the position they either I am not sure, see to -- which one it is I am not sure whether they take position, that Section 20 does not include a public interest standard or that in that alternative addressing, serves your alternative theory that the Commission is justified in close calling consideration of Section 7 and Section 5?"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1319.417,1325.002,"Well, I think they are certainly -- I didn't' mean to suggest that they were apart in this case."
1966.305,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1333.79,1343.724,There is some indication of at least prospective diversions of views between the United Sates and the Commission on the bottom of page 19 the joint brief filed --
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1343.724,1346.116,"Well, that's the paragraph that I have reference to Mr. Justice Stewart."
1966.305,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.116,1348.065,Yes yeah.
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1348.065,1349.397,So I --
1966.305,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1349.397,1350.99,I guess that's the only indication.
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1350.99,1353.161,That's the only indication that's right.
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1353.161,1357.153,This possible disagreement as to what happens hereafter?
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1357.153,1358.012,Yes.
1966.305,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1437.046,1456.187,"Does the government concede that a matter would be ripe for a discussion of Section 7 and Section 5, when this Section 8 provision is finally completed?"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1456.187,1461.341,I think so Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.305,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.348,1485.301,"Well, Mr. Dempsey let's assume that the, let's assume that a company acquires 20% of the competitor and the antitrust division immediately files a suit for an injunction."
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1535.654,1541.294,"Yes, well I think that I'd like to make my response in several parts to that Mr. Justice White."
1966.305,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.294,1542.662,I don't want to interrupt you.
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1542.662,1548.512,No that's not -- no those are points I would have made in any event.
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1573.108,1596.505,"As a matter of fact, I beg your pardon but in that little part, the United States [Inaudible] all United States says here that they, that it ought to be investigated, they don't say that [Inaudible] to say that this would be a violation of Section 7."
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1596.505,1605.173,They continue to believe that serious question on this score that is score of competitive consequences remain to be investigated I --
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1605.173,1608.113,I don't feel quite as so far they said there would be --
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1608.113,1623.282,"Well Mr. Justice Fortas I think maybe I should read from their, from their initial submission in this connection because I read what they said there to mean that they continue to have that view although its somewhat more ambiguously stated."
1966.305,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.738,1728.787,[Inaudible]
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1728.787,1731.323,"No, no [Attempt to Laughter] I don't."
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1756.873,1771.771,But if public interest does include competitive question then you are saying it is highly arguable that taking a position here which is opposite to the position what they took in Penn Central?
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1771.771,1784.402,"Yes I do Mr. Justice Fortas I don't mean to say that they are estopped or [Attempt to Laughter] that sort, but that the problem of the statutory framework is one that does exists."
1966.305,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.753,1806.502,"Where do the anticompetitive consideration come in under Section 5, if it was a Section 5 proceeding?"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1806.502,1808.162,If there was a Section 5 proceeding?
1966.305,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.162,1817.814,"Yeah, and they must consider the anticompetitive impact, is that within the, is that in connection with determining the public interest?"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1817.814,1825.998,"Well, if it's a railroad motor carrier case of course it comes in specifically Section 5."
1966.305,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.289,1837.877,That's why you contend that it must come in under 210a?
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1837.877,1842.482,"That's right, that's right, but it isn't the only reason though."
1966.305,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.363,1894.219,"I don't see, I really don't understand why you think you have the better case, you say that the public interest includes anticompetitive consideration, or whether you say that it does [Inaudible] Section 11 now, it says [Inaudible] –-"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1894.219,1906.004,"Well, Mr. Justice White, I don't know that we do have a better case, it seems it's a little easier to argue but as -- in point of fact I don't suggest that the case should come out any differently."
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2120.125,2149.045,"Does the threshold legal position here mean that they -- antitrust division of the Department of Justice of the United States and the ICC take the position under Section 20, for example, that the New York Central could sell X percent of it's stock to the Pennsylvania railroad, that the Commission would pass upon that without regard to competitive effect?"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,2149.045,2153.817,"Under Section 20, I think indisputably true that's their position under Section 20."
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2153.817,2168.736,If that is their position and the Commission's position is they could defer it indefinitely or defer to a later date the consideration of the anticompetitive effect?
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,2168.736,2170.377,As I understand it that is their position.
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2170.377,2187.147,"Now, actually there would be a different [Inaudible] truth would there not, if public interest under Section 20 repeals anticompetitive effect, would the burden of proof be one the applicant?"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,2187.147,2188.775,Burden of truth is on the applicant under Section 20.
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2188.775,2197.066,"And how about -- and the same thing would be true under Section 11, Section 7, that the burden of -- I mean say the opposite would be true, the burden --"
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,2197.066,2200.673,"No, I wouldn't say the opposite would be true under Section 11, now under --"
1966.305,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2200.673,2202.22,How about Section 5?
1966.305,6,44444,william_h_dempsey,,2202.22,2210.795,"Under Section 5 I would say that there too the -- well, if it's an application for approval and of course the applicant has the burden of approval."
1966.305,7,29010,justice_bernnan,,2451.037,2452.359,May I just ask Mr. Dempsey?
1966.305,8,44444,william_h_dempsey,,2475.141,2480.447,"No, I think with all of those results would be well within the discretion of the Commission Mr. Justice Brennan."
1966.305,9,29010,justice_bernnan,,2480.447,2481.888,And you got them too?
1966.305,10,44444,william_h_dempsey,,2481.888,2482.119,Yes.
1966.305,11,29010,justice_bernnan,,2482.119,2483.689,"You ratify two cues, one of --"
1966.305,12,44444,william_h_dempsey,,2483.689,2487.376,"Yes, yes."
1966.305,12,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2487.376,2489.268,Mr. Barr.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2489.268,2492.294,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2598.932,2602.266,How does that work Mr. Barr?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2610.499,2612.812,"Yes Your Honor it does, they do."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2612.812,2614.788,"And that's in the agreement, is it?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2614.788,2618.22,"Yes sir, it is, it's in the standard operating agreement."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2633.413,2638.83,How can the railroad stop Greyhound or anybody else from calling for tenders --?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2638.83,2647.533,"Well they can't do that Your Honor, but they can prevent the stock that is tendered from going through to Greyhound by exercising the right of first refusal after it has been tendered, Greyhound --"
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2647.533,2653.424,"Then the tender will be made by the individual stockholder, will it not or do I misunderstand this?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2653.424,2658.813,"No you don't sir, Greyhound will offer to accept tenders up to 40% of the stock."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2661.203,2662.1,To Greyhound.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2662.1,2670.111,"To Greyhound, once that is made, all of REA's other stockholders have the right to take in and say I'll take it at the same price."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2670.111,2673.543,"From, they have that right from Greyhound?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2673.543,2674.791,"From, no Your Honor."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2686.17,2688.84,Well I haven't read the document and I would --
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2688.84,2690.794,All right sir.
1966.305,13,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2700.856,2705.809,"All the stockholders are Railroads, aren't they, except for this new stockholder Greyhound?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2705.809,2714.516,Yes sir and as I will explain to you in just a moment REA is rather peculiar kind of animal in that respect and I think that's very important now.
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2755.341,2761.974,Greyhound -- I guess we have to assume that Greyhound intends to go through with the terms --
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2761.974,2771.492,"No doubt about that, there is no doubt whatsoever Mr. Justice Fortas that Greyhound wants to buy control of REA and wants to exercise that control I don't contend otherwise."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2771.492,2772.129,Alright.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2777.949,2780.642,It is not defined under Section 20 at all Your Honor.
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2780.642,2783.871,Isn't there a phrase control or power to control --
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2783.871,2791.795,That's under Section 5 and it's only under Section 5 that the control problems can be raised. Section 20a doesn't have anything to do with control.
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2800.052,2805.313,Then my question should have been asked with respect to Section 5 and Section 5 does say --?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2805.313,2815.373,"It is a very broad definition, control or power to control and the cases make perfectly clear that the definition is a very broad one and it comes down to something like the power to influence."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2815.373,2818.409,It's like the definition in some of SEC Act?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2818.409,2820.305,Yes sir.
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2820.305,2833.616,Is there anything in the record to indicate why this 60-day provision couldn't have been fulfilled before the Commission acted --
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2833.616,2834.517,Yes sir there is.
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2834.517,2843.202,"-- in which event perhaps a question of whether Section 7 or 5 applies, would be right?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2843.202,2849.33,"Yes sir, there is and I plan to describe that at some length and let me answer your question."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2941.006,2942.569,I beg your pardon--
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2942.569,2955.106,"Where do I find in the record, the stated reason of the Commission as to why this was not required –?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2955.106,2957.066,"Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice Warren --"
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2957.066,2962.153,Why they didn't wait until 60-day provision was exercised?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2962.153,2966.225,You won't find any statement by the Commission to that effect in the record sir.
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2966.225,2967.793,"Well, that was my question."
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2980.231,2983.688,No sir you won't find them stating expressly that.
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2986.598,2992.245,"So you are giving me your, your reasons why but not the Commission's reasons."
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,2992.245,3004.006,"Commission's reason was You Honor that it said it would not be appropriate to consider the Section 5 or Section 7 issues at this time and that appears in the order, which --"
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3004.006,3008.526,Yes I understood that but is that supported by any finding or any reason?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3008.526,3008.889,Well it goes on --
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3008.889,3014.209,"-- if anything that it, that it put him a record --"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3014.209,3020.365,"The Commission goes on that, Your Honor please after it makes that finding."
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3093.631,3103.424,I want to ask sir the appellants here have characterized themselves as minority stockholders of REA.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3107.6,3123.783,"Together the five appellants have 245,000 shares of stock out of presently outstanding 2 million, so they have a little more than 10% with the additional 500,000 that would be issued to Greyhound, they have slightly less than 10% --"
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3123.783,3131.417,So that there are some stockholders who presumably are in favor of this?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3131.417,3132.562,There is certainly oh!
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3140.255,3149.233,"I see, I asked that question and you mentioned your pessimistic forecast as to the results of the call for tenders --"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3149.233,3157.987,"I wanted to make it clear that 900 -- the holders of 900,000 shares have said they will sell their stock and they don't care who they sell it to."
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3167.729,3173.944,"What percentage, the line of commerce these two companies have?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3173.944,3175.86,Your Honor this is not in the record.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.751,3249.266,"You agree -- you agree that -- do you agree then that even if there is no Section 5 problem in the sense of a control problem that if REA never or if the Greyhound never acquires any more stock and no one suggest there is a control problem, you would agree that there is still a--"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3249.266,3251.093,There is still something that has to be resolved.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.093,3257.391,"Under the purposes of Section 7 or Section 20a, one of the other or both?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3257.391,3260.341,"Well, I don't think it comes under Section 20a at all I agree."
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.341,3272.996,I know but you would agree that when anyone -- if anyone acquires 20% of the competitor that there is a -- that there is some order of the Section 7 problem?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3272.996,3275.117,I certainly do sir.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.117,3284.282,"you call it 20a or not but in connection with the 20a acquisition, there can arrive a Section 7 problem?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3284.282,3285.581,Absolutely.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.581,3286.752,And that must be resolved?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3286.752,3294.852,And indeed and in many cases Your Honor the only proper to way to do it is to do it all at once and I'm not saying otherwise.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.716,3348.325,"Fundamental of that proposition though, I take it is that the public interest as used in Section 20a or Section 20 does not include, does not have to include any anticompetitive impact?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3348.325,3351.618,"I quite agree, it is fundamental and I take that position."
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.618,3359.61,"Although the public interest under Section 5 the same words, those same words do include anticompetitive consideration?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3359.61,3363.852,"They are not exactly the same words, but for all intents and purposes there --"
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.852,3365.635,-- those words are there.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3365.635,3368.096,The public interest is but I --
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.096,3372.075,But under Section 5 that does include and anticompetitive --
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3372.075,3373.037,No doubt about it.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.037,3378.037,Even though they are not mentioned.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3381.666,3394.909,"Well, I think they are Mr. Justice White because it requires the Commission under Section 5, Commission is required to take into consideration the impact upon other carriers in making its determination under Section 5."
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3394.909,3398.294,But it doesn't talk about competition?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3398.294,3414.798,"No sir but I always thought that the principal impact upon other carriers would be the competitive impact, but in any case this Court has made clear in McLean and lately in the Seaboard case that the Commission must take the -- within the policy to the antitrust law -–"
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.798,3416.64,Within the concept of public interest?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3416.64,3418.391,Yes sir under Section 5.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.391,3431.965,"Let's assume that public interests were construed to mean under Section 20, that the public interest meant the same in both sections, then where are you?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3431.965,3433.371,Then you reverse.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.371,3433.674,Oh!
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3441.564,3444.701,If no – excuses me – if what you say --
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.701,3451.316,"The Commission will certainly approve it now, will approve it now because it's consistent, but they did say it's consistent with the public interest, isn't it?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3451.316,3473.955,"If you say that the Commission may not authorize a 20a approval without considering the anticompetitive effects and if this Court holds that, that the public interests includes that, that the public interest in 20a the language of 20a includes that and the Commission has not done that."
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3473.955,3476.644,You say it includes only what?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3476.644,3488.813,"I say that section 20a Your Honor in this I think Mr. Rifkind is going to deal with this more fully, but I say the 20a is a statute that is designed to deal only with the physical questions."
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3540.709,3551.538,But is there anything in the legislative history that actually limits this to fiscal matters?
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3551.538,3553.96,"No, Your Honor there isn't anything that actually limits it."
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3553.96,3557.775,"But why, what do we rely on then?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3557.775,3567.9,There isn't anything in the legislative history that in anyway suggests to me that it is supposed to consider any thing other than what I'll call the stock watering problem.
1966.305,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3623.524,3637.372,"Are there any, any cases in this area which holds that the public convenience or necessity incorporates only fiscal matters?"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3637.372,3656.799,"Virtually no cases at all under Section 20 and there are no cases that can be -- the two or three cases that have been decided under Section 20, all suggest to me and we cite them in our brief that the only thing that Section 20a is designed to do is to deal with these physical matters."
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3698.605,3707.018,But you say -- you've said under the -- you've said that public interest remains the same thing under 20 as it does under 5 but we have to reverse.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3728.021,3731.594,I think they could do that and I misunderstood your question Mr. Justice White.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3749.668,3759.634,"This is what the Commission did in this case, in this case it said it's consistent with the public interest which if it includes in there a competitive impact they haven't considered that and they're wrong."
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3759.634,3771.943,But I think the analogy you drew between the denial of the preliminary injunction in this situation is an apt one in terms of what happened.
1966.305,13,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.055,3798.125,"Let's do it another way, let the acquisitions go forward and then we'll consider the --"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3798.125,3801.296,Let's no – let's -- let the first part of it go through.
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3811.484,3827.333,Perhaps difficulty is implicit in that is that if Greyhound stocks had 20% and the Commission seems to imply that they will have to look into anticompetitive aspects.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3833.659,3835.63,We it doesn't have any alternative in that respect sir.
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3835.63,3836.405,I am sorry.
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3836.405,3837.463,It does not have any alternative in that respect.
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3837.463,3844.806,"Alright, let's suppose it exercised its option and then they get any of the stock and it seems to me --"
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3844.806,3846.299,"No, stock changes hand --"
1966.305,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3846.299,3852.332,It seems to be implicit here that the Commission knew that they will vary from dynamic competitive --
1966.305,13,42445,thomas_d_barr,,3852.332,3853.706,I don't think that's so Your Honor.
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3875.199,3886.981,-- that they are as that as a result of the history of expansion of the term control and if they are coextensive by reason of the rational necessity of construing this regulatory scheme.
1966.305,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3886.981,3899.143,"But let's assume that there is an acquisition under Section 20, which no one even suggests raises any control problems within the Section 5."
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3906.645,3930.887,"But all I'm suggesting Mr. Justice White, is that we can't conceive of a influence of one corporation on another that would tend substantially to lessen competition that would not also involve an element of control such as to invoke the Commission's' jurisdiction under Section 5."
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3968.832,3974.466,You mean that they mean substantially the same thing too --
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3974.466,3977.167,They certainly don't mean the same thing and that they have the same --
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3977.167,3978.178,Cover the same thing?
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3978.178,3979.561,They cover the same ground.
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3979.561,3983.186,What if they cover the same thing and [Inaudible]
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3983.186,3987.519,"Well, but they deal with the problems in somewhat different ways."
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3990.341,3997.476,Each one of them deal with all the phases that the other one deals with?
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3997.476,4013.249,"Well with the exception of the fact that under Section 7, no one is authorized to consider whether the lessening of competition may not be over balanced by some advantage to public interest."
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4013.249,4016.143,Added to it or the same thing?
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4016.143,4023.284,"Balanced, bias whereas that's just what the Commission is required to do under Section 5."
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4023.284,4042.758,"Could you tell me in one or two sentences, what would be the difference in the consequences of your position and of your adversary?"
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4042.758,4070.795,"The only -- the only -- well the consequence of my adversary's position is that the Commission cannot under any circumstances approve a stock issuance, an issuance of securities without considering in advance any competitive anticompetitive effects that might flow form there."
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4080.674,4084.796,Each one or other said that?
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4084.796,4086.818,We want the decision below affirmed.
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4086.818,4088.501,You want it affirmed?
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4088.501,4089.987,The decision of the District Court.
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4089.987,4091.497,Which it does postpone.
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4091.497,4095.804,Which authorizes the Commission to postpone the Section 5?
1966.305,14,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4095.804,4097.417,But that's the only difference between --
1966.305,14,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4097.417,4097.979,That's right.
1966.305,15,29010,justice_bernnan,,4101.143,4103.518,"Well let's see it, what is that?"
1966.305,16,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4111.051,4111.929,That's right.
1966.305,17,29010,justice_bernnan,,4111.929,4119.563,"Now, under Mr. Dempsey's position it would not that be set aside pending further proceeding?"
1966.305,18,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4119.563,4120.345,Well that's right they will --
1966.305,19,29010,justice_bernnan,,4120.345,4127.303,"Well, that's pretty big difference, isn't it?"
1966.305,20,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4127.303,4130.073,It would be set aside until the Commission had considered the Section 5.
1966.305,21,29010,justice_bernnan,,4130.073,4136.872,"That's what I say whereas if you prevail, this purchase to the 500,000 goes through?"
1966.305,22,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4136.872,4137.339,That's right.
1966.305,23,29010,justice_bernnan,,4137.339,4146.285,And then pending the outcome of experience with the tender would be an ultimate determination on the anticompetitive aspect?
1966.305,24,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4146.285,4146.782,That's right.
1966.305,25,29010,justice_bernnan,,4146.782,4147.52,Is that it?
1966.305,26,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4147.52,4167.844,I do stress though that there is every -- there is no reason to believe as appellants have worried about that they are likely to be so seriously injured during the period after the tender offer is concluded before the Section 5 hearing to be completed.
1966.305,26,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4167.844,4194.465,Does the government take the position that it will be not be possible by reasonably 20% stock interest or operating consolidations and changes to be effective that is to say consolidation of facilities and services between Greyhound and Railway Express Agency.
1966.305,26,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4194.465,4196.736,Well first of all any of the --
1966.305,26,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4196.736,4199.557,Do you regard that as immaterial?
1966.305,26,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4199.557,4202.239,No at least I don't think I do.
1966.305,26,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4224.98,4247.354,"Well, I understand that but changes could be made, there could be a consolidation of operating stations, places where freight is received, facilities for the handling of freight and so on, immediately after the 20% acquisition is effective, isn't that right?"
1966.305,26,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4247.354,4256.809,"They could do that I suppose, but they would run the very grave risk that the Commission would find that they had -- the Greyhound had achieved control."
1966.305,26,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4256.809,4272.014,Well -- but in some other cases I've heard so many of your colleagues up here arguing about the impossibility of something called unscrambling and you're satisfied that there would be no problem about unscrambling here?
1966.305,26,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4272.014,4275.488,This is imminently unscramble [Inaudible] to me.
1966.305,26,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4275.488,4290.83,"This is an unscramble of proforma so that if the 20% acquisition is approved and the separate eggs are scrambled and an omelet emerges, it's unscrambled."
1966.305,26,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4290.83,4300.695,I think there is no question that Greyhound can be called upon to divest itself of its stock and --
1966.305,26,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4300.695,4325.708,But the real question is not the divestiture of the stock if I understand accurately I heard you fellows in other cases but it's a question of what happens to the operating facilitates and whether the words would be changed but the malady would linger on by means of the consolidation etc of the operating facilities.
1966.305,26,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4325.708,4348.892,"Well, I still stress that many of the thoughts of consolidation were independently required Commission approval in many of other forms and it doesn't seem to me that this is something that's going to happen imminently and suddenly within those 60 days before the Commission can begin to act under Section 5."
1966.305,27,29010,justice_bernnan,,4348.892,4364.302,"Well, Mr. Rifkind can there be any scrambling with this really -- ultimately the transaction is disapproved results only in the stock going back to REA and the money going back to Greyhound or is there any other unscrambling involved?"
1966.305,28,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4364.302,4369.624,"That, as a matter of fact it isn't even so clear that the money need to go back to Greyhound."
1966.305,29,29010,justice_bernnan,,4375.311,4381.298,Well I am what I am getting at is all that's involved then is the divestiture of the stock?
1966.305,30,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4381.298,4381.804,That's right.
1966.305,31,29010,justice_bernnan,,4381.804,4386.029,There would be no combination as in Penn Central in a lot of facilities.
1966.305,32,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4386.029,4390.42,I think those are still prospective no one has actually began to --
1966.305,33,29010,justice_bernnan,,4390.42,4412.817,"There is plenty of material in this record that indicates that once 20% acquisition takes effect, these people propose to go right ahead and to consolidate operations just as they made in Penn Central."
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4412.817,4441.014,"Well, again it seem to me this is likely to depend very heavily on what happens during those 60 days whether Greyhound will plan to tie itself up intimately with a company, where a majority of the stock is owned by railroads, who are literally possible to it, if Southern Pacific let's say exercised its right of first refusal, is a dubious question."
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4441.014,4459.963,"Mr. Rifkind, we are not talking about a delay of just 60 days, are we and let's say they possibly the effectuation of a tender offer, we're talking about a delay which will probably extend into many, many months, isn't that right?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4459.963,4461.962,The tender offer has to be concluded.
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4461.962,4466.757,And they have to get approval of the ICC then?
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4466.757,4468.04,For what?
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4468.04,4473.485,For the acquisition of the stock under the tender offer.
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4473.485,4473.739,If they should --
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4473.739,4475.063,It's not has been approved here.
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4475.063,4485.275,If they should -- well this is already outstanding stock so that the stock that's to be acquired under the tender offer doesn't have anything to do with Section 20a in any event.
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4485.275,4486.679,But does it --
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4486.679,4488.391,But it raises questions under 5.
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4488.391,4490.43,It raises questions under 5.
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4490.43,4490.572,That's right.
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4490.572,4494.496,"The approval would be necessary, wouldn't it or have they conceded that too?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4494.496,4494.714,Oh!
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4531.592,4544.319,Isn't the posture of this case quite similar to that of Penn Central so far as truncating the actions of the Commission are concerned?
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4544.319,4553.564,"Well, I mean that's somewhat awkward decision in that respect because the government then -- the ICC would not, in harmony the government and the ICC were not in harmony."
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4553.564,4557.172,"Well, let's take the position of the government."
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4557.172,4561.129,I think that there is a very marked difference here.
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4605.766,4655.549,"I don't want to have Penn Central to be reargued I thought that the both sides agree that Penn Central that it was the obligation of the Commission to determine certain things and the only question was whether it had the right to delay those things until a time when it felt that those matters were ripe for decision and as I understood it, the government [Inaudible] as this can't be the time because if we do a couple of unscrambling, they will probably set forth in many ways and the government argued very earnestly in that case that that wasn't proper time."
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4660.336,4663.029,Well I can suggest maybe two or three points.
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4717.005,4747.407,"Well I thought here the valid purpose of this transaction was to consolidate the terminals and to consolidate runs and all of those things, which under this agreement can be commenced at any time and if they wait until those things are done and terminals are closed and so forth how can it -- how can we unscramble it?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4747.407,4769.61,If Greyhound finds itself after 60 days in a position to effectuate the program of consolidation that it so earnestly desires then it seems to me quite clear that it must insulate REA from its control until the Commission has come to a conclusion --
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4769.61,4772.14,"What make you say, what's the basis for that statement?"
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4772.14,4773.885,Yes.
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4773.885,4778.142,Because if they should proceed to exercise control --
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4778.142,4781.575,Is there anything in the Commission order to that effect?
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4781.575,4800.334,"No, but there are great many cases that say that to – as this Court has said that the Commission is free to require divestiture because control has been acquired without authorization that what was said in Gilbertville and the Commission has done that in another cases."
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4849.142,4855.632,Was that in Penn State or Penn Central?
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4855.632,4868.779,My impression is things had gone rather beyond that there but I'm really not an expert on the Penn Central situation and I'd be reluctant to give you a off the hand opinion on it.
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4950.276,4960.199,"Do you, do you use the same standard for determining public interest as railroads as REA does in this case?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4960.199,4963.225,I don't know that we're in any disagreement.
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4963.225,4971.575,"But you don't think, you don't think that anticompetitive factors are involved in it?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4971.575,4972.307,Oh very definite.
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4972.307,4975.059,Under 20a?
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,4975.059,4991.404,I do -- it is our position that the -- it is our position that the public interest standard in 20a cannot mean the same thing as the public interest standard in Section 5 because of the very different nature and function of those two sections.
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5006.171,5029.548,"No, Mr. Rifkind I don't think that's quite the issue. Question is whether under 20a the public interest standard when in view of the Department of Justice does or does not mean that the Commission has to make findings with respect to the competitive or anticompetitive effect of a stock acquisition."
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5031.998,5034.947,Our position is that it need not inevitably do so.
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5034.947,5037.996,What you mean it says -- I don't understand that.
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5054.856,5061.418,"I agree, there may be situations, I can think of situations in which as a practical matter, it would make no sense."
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5061.418,5069.683,"Well, then you got to say that the statute does not require that the Commission make findings with respect to competitive effect?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5069.683,5071.746,"That's right, that is right."
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5073.741,5096.348,"If the New York Central let's say had acquired x percent, a substantial block of the stock of the Pennsylvania Railroad, then it's your position that the Commission would not have been required by Section 20a to make findings with respect to the anticompetitive effect."
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5096.348,5097.383,I think that is right.
1966.305,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5113.704,5122.415,So public interest under 20a as far as you're concerned doesn't reach any of the competitive effect?
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5122.415,5124.769,"That's right, that's correct and --"
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5124.769,5127.588,"I thought you said in some circumstances, it would?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5127.588,5131.261,"Well, the example that occurs to me is a very clear case."
1966.305,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5152.9,5156.779,So there aren't any competitive consideration in that finding --
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5156.779,5166.317,There may be very serious competitive considerations and I should think the Commission couldn't proceed under 20a until it had satisfied itself under Section 5 in that situation.
1966.305,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5166.317,5168.463,Why?
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5170.061,5182.739,"Because there is, because there is nothing to the -- there is no reality to the stock aspect of it, all there is, is a transfer of control but here there's $10 million."
1966.305,34,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5182.739,5193.003,"You mean there's no reality to it as turning in one batch of stock for, stock in one company for by the different kind of an ownership instrument."
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5193.003,5202.266,"Well that's true and I don't say that are no questions under 20a there but I'm saying the principal significance of the transactions from the Commission's point of view, it would have to be."
1966.305,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5218.849,5236.112,I suppose you mean as it appears that there's some serious threat or some likelihood or probability of a control for that antitrust problem or competitive problems.
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5245.239,5249.389,"Well, no because there are serious competitive questions here."
1966.305,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5276.147,5292.576,"Well, this stock issue, that the Commission's' order hasn't been challenged at all and the acquisition has approved, the stock was issued right there, when would the REA numbers or Greyhound numbers go on the board?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5292.576,5293.519,As far as I –-
1966.305,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5293.519,5294.155,Immediately?
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5294.155,5305.385,"-– understand – no, as far as I understand in the record there has been no application under 20a well for Commission to place Greyhound officers on the board of REA."
1966.305,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5308.113,5318.982,"I mean the contract is divested, if Greyhound goes there and agreed to buy the stock without knowing that they are going to be on the board?"
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5318.982,5331.578,"Well the by-laws of REA provide for them now and I think as a practical matter 20a (12) is not much of an obstacle because you can always find nominees who are not Greyhound officers, but who observe the purpose --"
1966.305,34,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5331.578,5338.773,I'm really talking about immediately issuing the stock and having Greyhound representative --
1966.305,34,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,5338.773,5341.268,That's true.
1966.305,34,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5345.246,5349.448,Mr. Dempsey.
1966.305,35,44444,william_h_dempsey,,5349.448,5350.995,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1966.305,35,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5425.485,5453.393,"It seems to me that I have heard of instances where the antitrust division and those other agencies and government have concerned themselves quite competent to appraise competitive or anticompetitive effects of maintenance of a – of a, the acquisition of a substantial block of stock at the threshold you even saw in preliminary injunction."
1966.305,35,44444,william_h_dempsey,,5453.393,5460.661,Well I would certainly agree with that Mr. Justice Fortas and we don't really see that a double proceeding would be necessary here.
1966.305,35,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5467.092,5476.499,"Well, if you're right, in your brief of course -- it would ultimately need to be one because, because you would sign to have the violation."
1966.305,35,44444,william_h_dempsey,,5476.499,5479.782,That's correct Mr. Justice White that's right.
