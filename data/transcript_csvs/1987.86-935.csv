1987.86-935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.888,"We will hear argument next in Number 86-935, Regents of the University of California v. Public Employment Relations Board, Et Al."
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,74.549,78.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,146.98,154.303,Isn't it going to cost the University some money either way?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,154.303,160.848,It will cost the University perhaps some money in that there may be more letters sent.
1987.86-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,160.848,163.791,"But it will cost the Postal Service, is that it?"
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,163.791,166.111,It will cost the Postal Service a lot of money.
1987.86-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,166.111,167.784,Thanks.
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,170.465,175.338,"It will not save them very much, actually."
1987.86-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,175.338,183.084,"It will save all the work involved in delivering this mail from where it is given to your client to deliver to the Union people, won't it?"
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,188.206,191.718,"Justice Scalia, I don't think they are losing money on this kind of delivery."
1987.86-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,210.021,211.893,I thought they were delivered throughout the University system?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,213.923,222.619,"The case arose over deliveries in Berkeley, but I think that you are right, Justice Stevens, that at stake here is a larger mail system."
1987.86-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,222.619,224.832,It is a big State and there are a lot of branches of the University.
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,224.832,225.84,That is right.
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,225.84,231.083,Will how we decide this case help me to get my mail faster?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,231.083,233.677,"Yes, it will, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,233.677,235.267,Do you really think so?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,235.267,236.458,I do.
1987.86-935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.533,264.486,"3,500,000 employees of what?"
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,264.486,269.481,These are employees of employers across the country.
1987.86-935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.481,271.641,"Oh, I see."
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,272.38,273.131,The Union represents those employees.
1987.86-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,273.131,276.925,Employers who would be in the position of the University?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,276.925,278.086,I believe so.
1987.86-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.086,278.865,Yes.
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,278.865,295.547,"It has to be recognized that if the Postal Service loses the revenue from those letters, other patrons of the Postal Service are going to have to pay for it, either in lower quality of service or in higher rates."
1987.86-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.059,337.964,You think it is clear from the language?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,337.964,343.407,"I think it is very clear from the language of the regulation, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.407,345.06,Let's talk about the regulation.
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,390.768,399.195,It is certainly true that the Postal Service is the chief competitor of those who would deliver it in competition with the Postal Service.
1987.86-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.501,426.963,What provision is that that enables them to do that?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,426.963,440.7,I can point you to the Code of Federal Regulations sections in which the suspensions are written.
1987.86-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.37,473.932,Thank you.
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,473.932,490.823,--The letters of the carrier regulation provides that the sending or carrying of letters is permissible if they are sent by or addressed to the person carrying them.
1987.86-935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.835,644.413,"Mr. Odle, I thought that the State legislature in California has determined that providing Unions access to the internal mail of the mail system is the current business of the University, or has made some effort legislatively to say that it is defining the business of the university as including this."
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,645.875,650.528,"Well, you realize first that the regulation states a two-part test."
1987.86-935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.141,667.26,"Well, of course, the statute itself, Section 1694, refers to, as the exception, except such as relates to the current business of the carrier."
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,667.26,670.052,That is right.
1987.86-935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.12,692.535,Is that your interpretation of the regulation and the validity of it?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,705.555,708.638,I think we would if we read the statute properly.
1987.86-935,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.537,744.22,"It would have been so easy to say that, though."
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,760.199,762.991,"That is true, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,921.516,926.449,"Counsel, it is still not clear to me how many people use this system."
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,926.449,929.691,"The University of California has about 100,000 employees."
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,939.048,941.468,What if a professor wants to send a letter to another professor down the hall?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,941.468,946.772,"If it is down the hall, he probably carries it."
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,953.968,956.71,It can be mailed by the same system.
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,959.901,970.057,"Because if the professor's letter is sent to another university employee on the business, that is, as a representative of the University, it is a letter to the University."
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,973.94,980.916,"If a professor is writing to another professor about a third professor at Harvard, that involves the University?"
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,980.916,984.897,"I would say it depends, Justice Marshall, if I may just take a moment to answer."
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,984.897,986.759,"Because if you take Harvard, I'm going to go to Oxford."
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,986.759,993.962,"Let us suppose that the professor at Harvard has applied for a job, and one professor writes to another and says he is good, I think you ought to hire him."
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.144,1000.057,What if he asks him how about his Union business?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,1002.4,1008.605,--I don't think that would be a letter to the University and I don't think it could be carried by the University.
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1008.605,1009.894,This is to another professor?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,1009.894,1010.565,That's right.
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1010.565,1016.189,I am writing to you to find out how is Joe Droke's standing with the Union.
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,1016.189,1028.647,"Unless you wanted to know that in order to conduct University business, your letter would not be a letter of the University."
1987.86-935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1037.483,1038.502,Isn't it?
1987.86-935,0,32290,james_n_odle,,1042.846,1046.807,I think the answer to that is more complicated than yes or no.
1987.86-935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.768,1077.858,"Thank you, Mr. Odle."
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1080.64,1090.117,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.053,1117.194,"Mr. Wright, what authority does the Postal Service have to issue this regulation?"
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1117.194,1127.491,"Section 401, 39 U.S.C. 401, which is quoted in a footnote on Page 23 of our brief."
1987.86-935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.491,1135.317,So you think that authority to issue that regulation entitles the Postal Service interpretation of the statute to some deference?
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1135.317,1136.096,I certainly do.
1987.86-935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.82,1175.252,How long has the Postal Service interpreted this Act that way?
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1175.753,1176.564,Yes.
1987.86-935,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1362.505,1367.477,"Mr. Wright, educate me, because I speak from ignorance."
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1377.423,1378.484,Yes.
1987.86-935,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1405.522,1409.736,It seems to me that this is devastating competition to the Postal Service.
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1409.736,1422.894,The legislative history of the 1979 amendment... we cited the hearings in our brief... the Postal Service adopted that suspension somewhat reluctantly.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.279,1555.33,"Mr. Wright, what is the compensation in this case?"
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1555.33,1558.623,There are three different kinds of compensation here.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1567.838,1571.191,"But it is a statutory requirement, isn't it, that they do this?"
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1571.191,1597.989,"If there was a statutory requirement that the University's dental school give free service to Union employees, or just employees of the University, I do not think there would be any question that that would arise out of the employment relationship, and the compensation to the University of the employees' labor was compensation whether or not it was statutory or contractual."
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.989,1602.76,"Tell me again, what is the compensation to the University for doing this?"
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1602.76,1604.683,Three things.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.998,1614.979,It is like a fringe benefit for the employees?
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1614.979,1616.15,Exactly.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.15,1620.602,You don't have any cases that are remotely like?
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1624.335,1627.718,"This is a unique case, because the State has ordered the carrying."
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1627.718,1628.657,Yes.
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1628.657,1644.608,"Second, the fact is that the State is the employer here, and it is just like the school district cases, in our view, except that the Unions go and negotiate with the legislature rather than directly with the University."
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.552,1652.042,I still don't understand.
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1659.909,1660.419,Right.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.419,1661.288,That's the compensation.
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1663.461,1666.164,Our next answer is that this is just like the school district cases.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.898,1677.971,In exchange for what?
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1678.991,1684.405,--Presumably it is agreeing to some other demand in the collective bargaining agreement.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.193,1728.295,"You are saying that this exception would not apply if I asked a friend to deliver a mail to someone, he is going to Chicago on an airplane and I say would you take a letter along and he says yes, I'll do it for you if you'll do the same thing for me a week from now on the return trip, then they have to pay postage?"
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1728.295,1730.938,We would say there is compensation here.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.076,1746.836,"Now, what is your third compensation?"
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1746.836,1749.678,"The third case is, PERB says we're wrong."
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1765.629,1771.343,I take it there is always some expense to the private carrier making the delivery.
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1773.373,1777.618,But it is different if the person ordering it also pays for it.
1987.86-935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.838,1815.682,"Mr. Wright, may I inquire whether you think we owe the same degree of deference to an agency's interpretation or construction of a statute by regulation if the effect of it is to pre-empt State law?"
1987.86-935,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1815.682,1819.635,"Yes, we think so."
1987.86-935,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.88,1858.701,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,1860.702,1867.568,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1917.991,1923.193,"Ms. Biren, let me ask you."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,1936.623,1949.33,"First of all, I think it is not the least bit clear that all 3,500,000 of them would be covered under a decision in our favor in this case."
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.761,1990.56,What difference does that make in interpreting the provisions here?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,1990.56,1994.791,If you were particularly bothered by the fact that--
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.791,1997.793,Let's assume you accept the regulation.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2006.848,2012.021,--I think that these deliveries are within both the statute and the regulation.
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.021,2016.084,"Because the employees, the recipients, are agents of the University?"
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2016.084,2018.516,For several reasons.
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2019.748,2022.039,But in terms of the regulation.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2022.039,2024.32,"--In terms of the regulation, that is what I am going to talk about."
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2143.428,2150.542,"When you say State funding, I mean, did the California legislature appropriate money to the University of California to perform these services?"
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2150.542,2156.036,The State of California appropriates money to fund the mail system.
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.956,2180.681,"So far as you can see, the University will get the same line item, if it is a line item, for carrying mail, even after this as before?"
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2180.681,2187.327,"To the extent that the record deals with this matter, that seems to be the case."
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.407,2191.539,The line item meaning what?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2192.29,2194.27,Right.
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.27,2197.663,100 percent of whatever mail they carry gets paid for by the State.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2197.663,2198.464,That's right.
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.464,2204.588,The State has told them to carry the mail and the State is going to pay for 100 percent of the carriage.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2219.497,2232.665,"Because I think if you look at the traditional interpretation of the meaning of compensation within this exception, if you start from 1792, in the first statute it talked about for hire or reward."
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.693,2245.635,Do you have any cases that are even close to this case?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2245.635,2246.336,No.
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.26,2354.916,It would be one thing if the University were here insisting that they had a right to do this under the statute.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2356.856,2359.928,The University does say no.
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.003,2378.751,"It seems to me you would have a little bit different case here if the University were on the other side of the case and it was the University and the Unions against the Government, in effect."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2378.751,2384.105,Are you talking specifically about the private hands exception?
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.105,2385.296,I'm talking about both.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2387.377,2393.181,"Let me give you an example in return, because I think it shows."
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.122,2429.816,"I don't know whether they want to do it or not, but I suppose they want to obey the Federal law, too."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2429.816,2431.876,"They do, indeed."
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.876,2443.574,"What if the University had been convinced that they could legally carry this and wanted to, but they just happened to be wrong."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2448.078,2455.911,It appears to me that what they do is they inform them that they are carrying in error.
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.911,2459.886,"And they have informed the University here, haven't they?"
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2459.886,2460.554,They have.
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.554,2466.278,"So the University has some grounds for saying, let's be careful."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2466.278,2467.93,And that's why we're here.
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.356,2518.233,I haven't heard you argue yet that the regulation here is invalid.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2519.573,2521.726,--Which regulation are we talking about?
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.726,2522.886,The regulation on the letter.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2522.886,2525.439,"No, I don't argue that it is invalid."
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.439,2529.461,So it is a legitimate interpretation of the statute?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2529.461,2538.487,"Correctly interpreted to allow employees to receive mail in the labor relations situation, yes."
1987.86-935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.487,2540.747,But what if we disagree with you on the interpretation of the regulation?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2542.289,2547.342,I think that the regulation is certainly an expansion of the plain words of the statute.
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.584,2663.268,"I just wonder whether you could not, by extending that reasoning, apply it to a business man and his client."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2704.745,2706.255,But there are two distinctions.
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.228,2741.619,That's right.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2753.276,2757.97,"My argument is twofold in that case, too."
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.245,2769.067,"The President of the University of California could not say ""give me that letter"" and open it up and read it, could he?"
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2769.067,2769.778,"--Well, in fact,--"
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.778,2771.018,It is not addressed to him.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2771.018,2777.222,"--But under this exception, they do have the right to monitor the mail."
1987.86-935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.287,2851.09,I wonder if that is right.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2864.43,2866.41,That is talking about who carries the letters.
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2866.41,2866.841,Correct.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2866.841,2873.125,"What they are saying is you cannot have a subcontractor carrying these letters, it has to be a regular employee of the University."
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.125,2876.976,"No, a regular employee of either the addressee or the sender."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2876.976,2877.357,Exactly.
1987.86-935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2877.357,2877.888,And he isn't here.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2886.874,2902.145,"Our contention is that in the sense that the employees here represent part of the University that makes its business decisions on labor relations, that that carrier is being employed by the University."
1987.86-935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.935,2907.156,"You are assuming that the addressees are the University, then?"
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2907.156,2908.178,"Oh, yes."
1987.86-935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.618,2916.113,You are saying the letters are addressed to the University?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2916.113,2917.645,They are addressed to the University.
1987.86-935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.417,2970.018,"Making that argument, what if the State of California, or the Legislature, passed a statute saying it is part of the responsibility of the University to foster good neighborhood relationships and one way to do that will be to add to the business of the University delivery of free mail to everybody within five miles of the campus?"
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2974.36,2984.518,"Certainly it would be a State law duty of the University, and to that extent, it would be the business of the University."
1987.86-935,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.841,2991.573,They would be people who are neighbors of the University.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,2991.573,2993.674,But that is not to or from the University.
1987.86-935,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3001.158,3014.638,"By reason of the statute, they have been made part of the University, in the common enterprise of fostering community relations, just as the Union, under your theory, has been made part of the University by the labor laws."
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3029.748,3038.424,"My theory is beyond that, because we are not... without having your entire statutory scheme about the neighborliness before me it is somewhat difficult."
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.123,3058.897,From whom do these letters... who sends them and who receives them?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3058.897,3068.851,"In this case, a University employee, William wilson, sent the letters to other University employees."
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3068.851,3071.375,What was the subject of the letters?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3071.375,3073.766,The subject of the letters was an organizing meeting.
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3073.766,3077.159,To get people to join the Union?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3077.159,3078.198,Exactly.
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3090.406,3099.493,What if William Wilson sent another kind of letter to another University employee that said let's organize a camping trip next weekend?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3108.819,3114.903,"Well, it is not the private carrier exception, it would be the business of the carrier exception."
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3114.903,3116.563,Pardon me.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3118.105,3119.185,Yes.
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.996,3135.236,What if the Legislature then says we think we should encourage all employees of the University to get out in the great California park system and that is a State duty of the University to encourage these people to get out?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3137.437,3149.805,"It would be then the State law duty and yes, it would change it, but... yes, it would change it."
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3161.924,3168.759,But the California Legislature surely has any number of areas of authority over the State University of California.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3172.229,3173.171,--That is right.
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.678,3197.096,Would you say it was beyond the competence of the California Legislature to pass a statute saying that it is the business of the University of California to encourage its employees to get out in the wilderness over the weekend?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3200.619,3204.901,"--No, I don't think it is beyond the competence of the Legislature."
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3212.677,3229.257,"You agree then that with a letter from Mr. Wilson of the circumstances I have described and with the statute, could that be carried by the University mail system without violating the Private Express Act?"
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3229.257,3242.096,It could be carried if it was specifically the State law duty imposed by law and it was going either from the carrier... in other words from--
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3242.096,3243.566,Mr. Wilson.
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3243.566,3252.272,"--Well, it could be going from Mr. Wilson to other agents of the carrier on the business of the carrier."
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3344.483,3347.255,Who wants to go camping by themselves?
1987.86-935,2,15456,andrea_l_biren,,3350.006,3351.679,That's right.
1987.86-935,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3360.864,3362.314,"Thank you, Ms. Biren."
