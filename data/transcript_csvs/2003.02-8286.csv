2003.02-8286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.91,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-8286, Delma Banks v. Doug Dretke."
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,54.696,56.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-8286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,114.35,121.203,And it... is it your contention that this is a basis simply for setting aside the sentencing phase of the trial?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,121.203,126.322,"We have asked this Court to affirm the district court, who... who did grant relief on death sentence."
2003.02-8286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.294,130.204,All right.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,151.009,158.932,"Your Honor, the reason why we take that position is that his testimony at the punishment phase is absolutely critical for the state to get the death penalty in this case."
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.275,197.242,"Well, but... but you... you have the burden, don't you, to show that the outcome would have been... would have been different had the... had the state come clean at the beginning?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,240.256,248.224,"--Your Honor, Mr. Banks denied at trial that he had any intent to commit any crime whatsoever with regard to this robbery."
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.422,249.877,Understand.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,256.274,257.101,--We think there's a world of--
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.101,262.84,And that would have... would have... would have tapped a wellspring of mercy in the... in the jury's breast?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,265.524,266.062,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.519,298.095,Recanted what testimony?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,298.095,301.689,No one had the intent to rob anybody.
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.918,304.744,Banks admitted that himself.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,304.744,311.597,--No. Mr. Banks admitted on the stand that he had finally agreed to accompany Mr. Farr to Dallas to get a gun.
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.031,326.17,What... what... what was... what was the gun going to be obtained for?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,327.035,327.657,--It was--
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.657,328.855,These people were being--
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,328.855,329.055,--it was a ruse--
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.055,329.681,--threatened by somebody?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,329.681,333.684,"--Justice Scalia, it was a ruse that Mr. Farr used that was not true--"
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.684,335.049,"Oh, that... that explains--"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,335.049,335.386,--to--
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.386,336.535,--why Farr got it.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,339.051,350.031,--But that was not the theory that the case... that the prosecutors asked the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Farr would... that Mr. Banks would be dangerous in the future.
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,356.141,356.984,As to materiality--
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,361.259,363.078,We... we do not agree with that.
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.952,415.751,"Well, you have to show cause and prejudice, and I thought that under Strickler, the... the necessity of showing prejudice requires that you show that there is a reasonable probability that the sentence would have been different."
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,415.751,416.66,"Your Honor, we've not--"
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.66,419.139,You... you don't think you have an obligation to show reasonable probability--
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,419.139,419.261,--We do.
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.883,420.542,--that the sentence would have been different.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,420.542,422.233,"--We do, Your Honor, and the district court--"
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.233,424.712,You... you acknowledge that you have to do that or?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,424.712,428.056,"--On... on cause, we do, Your Honor, and we... we... we've met that clearly."
2003.02-8286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.122,435.979,Alcorta was a case on direct review?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,435.979,441.263,"--It was a habeas case, Your Honor, but the Court has not distinguished between--"
2003.02-8286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.263,446.919,"But decided long before a lot of our other habeas cases, which are perhaps somewhat limited to relief?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,446.919,463.471,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but the Court, since Brecht, in... in subsequent cases, in... in Kyles and in Strickler, has continued to refer to the fact that there's this category of misconduct that has always been treated differently, and we do not see why it shouldn't be applied here."
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.969,493.287,May I ask you whether the record shows that counsel for Banks and Banks thought Farr was an informant back in 1980?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,493.287,498.271,--There was repeated effort by trial counsel to answer that question.
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.066,519.53,"Well, so there was a suspicion of that back in '80?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,519.53,522.381,"And I think after trial, given the--"
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,522.381,525.271,But then 16 years went by.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,525.271,527.107,"--Yes, Your Honor, because there were--"
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.107,530.927,And... and this wasn't evidence that was under lock and key.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,535.096,540.382,"--Your... Your Honor, there was... it was very difficult for us to obtain this proof."
2003.02-8286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,566.138,575.426,Suppose we find that the... or... or conclude that the defense counsel was not as diligent as it ought to have been on this point.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,583.782,589.877,"Your Honor, we think that we acted reasonably and diligently in post-conviction."
2003.02-8286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.772,610.06,"Well, it's... there's perhaps a slight difference in being misled and simply a... a case in which the prosecution does not come forward with Brady material."
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,623.063,624.55,That would be under Strickler.
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.493,639.843,What--
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.843,642.177,--But specifically the misrepresentations were what?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,642.177,646.43,Were that Farr had... had... had denied that he was a paid informant.
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,651.426,651.465,Okay.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,651.465,652.579,--truthful in every way with you.
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,652.579,661.124,"Had they also not given, or... or before trial had they not also said, we'll give you everything in the file?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,661.124,669.092,"They said, you don't have to file a discovery motion, we will disclose to you material that is discoverable, and this clearly was discoverable material--"
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,669.092,669.297,Okay.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,669.297,670.206,--when they put him on the witness--
2003.02-8286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,670.206,675.407,--But they didn't... the defendant didn't ask to discover anything.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,680.98,681.146,--He--
2003.02-8286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,681.146,683.664,What did... what... what did he ask for?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,685.522,692.459,"--He filed a standard discovery motion, but the... the Government long before that said, you don't have to file a motion, we'll provide material that's discoverable to you."
2003.02-8286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,698.525,698.98,Did... did--
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,698.98,699.806,--that status.
2003.02-8286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.806,707.691,"--did... did the defendant get anything after the prosecutor said, you don't have to file any formal motion, we'll give you everything you're entitled to?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,707.691,712.371,It... the prosecution revealed prior convictions on its witnesses.
2003.02-8286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.753,719.746,Were there documents--
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,719.746,719.951,"--Okay, but--"
2003.02-8286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.951,737.207,"--Were there documents or arrest reports to show Farr's informant status, or was this just a... a... a circumstance where the prosecution should have said orally that this is his status?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,737.207,747.071,"When we finally obtained what was represented to us to be the full prosecution file in this case, there was not one notation in there with regard to Mr. Farr, identifying him as an informant."
2003.02-8286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.203,751.037,So then there... you're not complaining that documents weren't turned over?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,751.037,751.575,--That's correct.
2003.02-8286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,751.741,755.29,You're complaining that the... that... that a statement was not made by the prosecution?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,755.29,763.342,"--That... that we believe the law required them, once they decided to put this informant on the stand, to disclose that factor to the defense."
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,763.342,765.2,Because it was Brady material?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,765.2,766.481,Because it was Brady material.
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,766.481,766.852,All right.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,793.807,799.546,"It was turned over after a general discovery motion was filed, but that discovery motion was never taken up at a hearing."
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,800.661,800.861,All right.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,807.681,810.115,--It... I believe it said give us prior convictions.
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,810.775,812.799,"Well, then that was what they gave you."
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,812.799,814.618,"--And that's all that they provided, that's correct."
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,814.618,826.545,"I mean, the problem that I'm... I'm having with this is, I thought at... and... and I... I... I got into this myself, I realize, but I thought they had said, in effect, we'll give you everything you're entitled to."
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,884.131,893.956,"I think that they assured counsel that whether it was... whether they had to disclose something under state law or under Brady, that there was no need for litigation."
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.897,899.407,But did they issue or counsel that counsel would not have to ask for it?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,899.407,907.125,"--The letter... the letter says, you do not have to file a motion, we'll provide you with material that the law requires us to disclose--"
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.125,909.354,That the law requires us to disclose?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,909.354,909.892,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.892,910.802,Material.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,922.44,933.131,"But, Your Honor, it said in lieu of a motion, and so I think it was fair for counsel to include that there needed to be no litigation about discovery--"
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.131,933.874,Well--
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,933.874,936.475,--that the Government understood what state law and Federal law required.
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,936.475,942.009,"--But maybe there had to be a request, not litigation, but say, tell me, was he an informant?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,942.009,942.956,"Well, Your Honor--"
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,942.956,943.495,Tell me.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,944.238,948.036,"--I think after these assurances, I think counsel--"
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,948.036,949.317,Please answer that question.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,949.317,949.567,--I'm sorry.
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,949.567,956.254,Did you ever ask the prosecution whether Farr was an informant?
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,956.254,959.598,"At trial, there's nothing in the record where the prosecution was specifically asked."
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,974.337,975.906,"Now, when was this?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,975.906,982.594,"--That was in state post-conviction proceedings, and the... and he has was required to respond truthfully to that, and under state law that--"
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.594,983.625,He didn't respond falsely.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,984.74,987.878,"--But under state law that is a no, that is a denial."
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.878,987.978,But--
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,987.978,988.144,But he--
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,988.144,990.168,"--A failure to respond is a no, rather than... than a yes?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,990.168,994.914,--Any... any factual allegation of petition that is not addressed specifically in the answer is treated as--
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.914,995.286,So as a--
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,995.286,995.741,--a denial.
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,995.741,997.31,--And... and in addition--
2003.02-8286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.31,998.22,"--It was more than that though, wasn't it?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,1009.942,1020.427,"Well, it's clear that when you read their answer that the state had denied our allegation that Mr. Farr was a paid informant in this case."
2003.02-8286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1020.427,1026.289,"And they had in effect at trial in the jury argument vouched for his truth, as I understand it."
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,1026.289,1029.344,On... on both at the guilt innocence phase and at the punishment phase.
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1029.344,1029.527,Yeah.
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,1045.773,1048.252,"Your Honor, there aren't--"
2003.02-8286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1048.252,1052.711,"I mean, you... well, you can argue it was his responsibility, you know, but I'm not talking about whether it was his responsibility."
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,1052.711,1061.915,--Mr. Elliott gave an affidavit in state post-conviction that said that he was aware of all the facts pursuant to the investigation and the presentation of evidence in this case.
2003.02-8286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1076.776,1077.974,In 19--
2003.02-8286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1077.974,1084.54,"--This is a bit of an aside, but do you know whether any disciplinary proceedings were ever brought against the prosecutors?"
2003.02-8286,0,25591,george_h_kendall,,1084.54,1086.313,There have been absolutely no disciplinary proceedings whatsoever.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1721.537,1725.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.051,1756.626,"Did... did the state deny in one of these habeas applications, deny that Farr was an informant?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1756.626,1758.855,"No, Your Honor, the state never denied it."
2003.02-8286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1759.598,1760.507,"Well, now wait a minute--"
2003.02-8286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1760.507,1761.167,--Then explain to me what was--
2003.02-8286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1761.167,1781.972,"--in... in... in the state habeas proceeding, the state submitted a response to the petitioner's petition and denied all the allegations in the petition, which included the assertion that Farr was a paid informant and that the state had withheld that information from Banks."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1784.201,1785.62,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-8286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1825.69,1834.235,"Ms. Bunn, did not the state say, we deny each and every factual allegation in this complaint?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1834.235,1835.433,Yes.
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.484,1845.835,"You better be careful what you deny, don't you think?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1859.127,1861.622,"--Yes, Your Honor, and it does appear that--"
2003.02-8286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.622,1868.952,Is it that the case that... do you now concede that Farr was paid something for his information--
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1868.952,1870.067,--Yes.
2003.02-8286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.067,1870.438,--by the state.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1870.438,1871.181,Yes.
2003.02-8286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1876.056,1876.344,Yeah.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1885.921,1888.111,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.613,1897.649,"He knew... he knew that Farr was testifying falsely and he... he let that testimony go, and indeed relied on it in his summation to the jury?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1897.649,1910.652,--What the trial prosecutor knew... there's nothing in the record to indicate the trial prosecutors actually knew about the money that Bank... that... that Farr was paid several months before the trial in this case by... by police investigators.
2003.02-8286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.652,1914.2,But isn't he charged with knowledge of what the organization as a whole did?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1914.2,1918.204,"In the... in the Brady disclosure context, certainly he is."
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1918.204,1923.2,Wasn't it representative of the police there at the trial the whole time to assist the prosecutor?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1923.2,1929.721,Not that... not that I'm aware of that the police were at the... at... really have testified in the trial.
2003.02-8286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.789,1954.491,"Well, I assume we have to take this case on the... the premise that the state somehow knew that the state had paid the money to Farr, and I guess also had promised some kind of a break not making certain criminal charges?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1954.491,1970.754,"--There is no evidence of any inducement of that kind to Farr in this case, no evidence of any kind of inducement whether financial or a break in... in any convictions for his testimony, contingent upon his testimony in this case."
2003.02-8286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.312,1980.785,But are you saying that because he was paid to help get the gun back rather than to testify falsely?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1980.785,1982.454,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-8286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.386,1990.323,"So that he was paid for a critical role in the scenario that led to the indictment, rather than post-indictment false testimony."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1990.323,1991.066,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2024.336,2041.797,"Well, does the petitioner's awareness that there is a... a claim supersede the prosecution's obligation to disclose Brady material, and to disclose the fact that one of its own witnesses lied on the stand?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2041.797,2052.737,"Not that it supersedes the obligation under Brady, but it does preclude a finding of cause in a case like this where the nondisclosure--"
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2052.737,2058.143,So the prosecution can lie and conceal and the prisoner still has the burden to... to discover the evidence?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2059.053,2075.234,"--Yes, Your Honor, because in a case like this, unlike Strickler, unlike Amadeo, this is more like... more like McCleskey, where the nondisclosure, whether in trial court or in state habeas, did not prevent the petitioner from developing the claim."
2003.02-8286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.234,2079.692,"But it didn't prevent it absolutely, but it made it pretty tough, didn't it?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2113.872,2124.153,"Well, Your Honor, this case does not present a situation where there is a record developed on what efforts Banks expended on this case."
2003.02-8286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2132.492,2132.864,I didn't say that.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2157.633,2164.404,"--Because they were obviously aware of the claim, aware of the potential existence of the claim."
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2183.184,2192.927,"But you want us to say that the... that the defendant relies on his peril, at his peril, on the representations of the... of prosecution?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2192.927,2206.59,"At... in... in a case like this where, unlike Strickler, where the evidence, the... the nondisclosed evidence was not in the sole possession of the state."
2003.02-8286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2217.819,2241.967,"No, but you are... are... aren't you arguing, just as Justice Kennedy suggested, that what they should have done in this case is to go to the court and say, we want further resources to investigate, and what specifically we want to investigate is an issue which, if we are correct, the state is affirmatively lying about."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2248.489,2250.613,"Well, yes, Your Honor--"
2003.02-8286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2250.613,2250.985,And for failure to do that--
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2250.985,2251.44,--that would be--
2003.02-8286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2251.44,2253.464,"--for failure to do that, they're out."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2254.7,2265.064,"--That is part of our position, that essentially the absence of that, the absence of a request for investigative assistance, the absence of any--"
2003.02-8286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2265.064,2266.96,"But, in the... in the... in the face of the state's representation."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2287.105,2292.845,"--Your Honor, they... there was an obligation from them to pursue the claim further, yes."
2003.02-8286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2292.845,2303.042,"Why wasn't there an obligation on the part of the prosecutor, having deceived the jury and the court, to come clean?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2350.309,2356.086,"Your Honor, the first... first it is not... that's not the question."
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2364.51,2369.999,"Well, but it is the question if... if Justice Ginsburg is right, that prosecutors have a continuing obligation."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2369.999,2378.544,"Well, that obligation is essentially triggered by materiality, so you have that working as well."
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2389.113,2401.373,"Well, if I were a defense counsel, I could think of a... of a... no more damaging material of cross-examination in this case than to show Farr was paid money to come up with the story."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2401.373,2406.202,"Well, Your Honor, again, that... that was not the... those are not the facts of this case."
2003.02-8286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2411.032,2413.427,"Yeah, that's true, but I... I mean, what--"
2003.02-8286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.427,2413.883,--But I think it's even--
2003.02-8286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2413.883,2444.263,"--what bothers me about your position is, if we were to say that a defense counsel behaves unreasonably when he relies upon an explicit statement of the prosecutor's, such as I deny the allegation, that's to say that the justice system lacks integrity, and indeed it might contribute to that lack of integrity to impose this kind of obligation and thereby excuse a prosecutor under circumstances like this."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2444.263,2452.686,But to find cause in a case like this would essentially be to hold that a Brady claim can never be defaulted because--
2003.02-8286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.686,2453.262,Of course it can.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2470.269,2486.699,"--And I want to focus also on the... on the record itself and what Banks... Farr was never asked specifically whether he was a police informant, so he never denied that allegation."
2003.02-8286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.157,2520.181,May I just interrupt with one question?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2557.788,2571.201,"--Again, though, the... the materiality of Farr's... of this nondisclosure has to be... there are several factors that have to be assessed in that... in that issue."
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.176,2596.631,What... what--
2003.02-8286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.631,2605.092,"--But it... it was diametrically opposed to the notion that he wanted to get the gun to commit robbery, as whereas the real purpose of the whole venture is to get the gun to give to the police."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2605.092,2615.206,"But Farr's subjective intent did not undermine Banks' intent, and Banks actually admitted at the punishment phase--"
2003.02-8286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.206,2622.553,"Banks' intent as revealed in Farr's testimony, which is the only evidence in supporting that theory that Banks was dangerous for that reason."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2622.553,2639.809,"--The difference is, Farr's testimony was... indicated that Banks was... had the intent himself to participate in the robberies, and Banks limited that to being willing essentially to... to abet Farr in... in committing those robberies."
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.809,2644.435,What... what page of the transcript that you... you cited page 37.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2646.004,2646.204,"Yes, joint appendix."
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.036,2656.507,And that is the... that is the confession of... I'm sorry... that... that is the perjury... that's the only perjury that's supposedly--
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2656.507,2661.487,--That's the... that's one instance that they... that... that's the only one dealing with money.
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.428,2666.65,"--Of course, this doesn't... this doesn't deal with whether he has... was a police informer."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2670.403,2672.444,"--Yes, yes, that's correct."
2003.02-8286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2679.214,2681.526,Have you ever taken any money from some police officers?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2682.453,2683.384,Yes.
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.314,2691.48,Where... where... where is that?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2693.959,2695.324,That is at joint appendix 37.
2003.02-8286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.324,2695.695,It's three lines down from the top.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2695.695,2707.584,"In the middle of the questioning about... about Farr's prior drug use, defense counsel asks, and... and have you ever taken any money from some police officers?"
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.865,2712.497,"Thirty, thirty-seven, my God, reading... oh, I got it, I got it, okay."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2712.497,2717.493,"--Further, he's asked, what police officers did you talk to about this?"
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.58,2721.863,Yeah.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2722.856,2728.345,"--which again is a false test... is a false statement, but does not specifically deny police informant status."
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2728.345,2734.002,"Now, it does seem to me that the Cooksey report that the... I think it... the Cook... the--"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2734.002,2734.474,Cook.
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2734.474,2735.078,--the witness Cook--
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2735.078,2736.193,"Yes, Charles Cook."
2003.02-8286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2736.193,2744.532,"--that the... that the report of his interviews with... with the police was... was very, very strong and helpful impeachment material."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2748.786,2750.105,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.903,2780.198,"Well, you said, I mean, the... the Fifth Circuit didn't think that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) applies in habeas, right?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2780.198,2782.139,"That was a basis of its holding, yes."
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.996,2786.154,Is... is that absolutely clear?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2786.154,2787.711,"No, Your Honor, it's not, and it--"
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.711,2794.77,"Well, if it's not absolutely clear, then... then it seems to me they should have... they should have granted the... the certificate of appealability."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2794.77,2816.485,"--The issue actually before the Fifth Circuit, the issue that it resolved, was whether... whether it was debatable... the district court... whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the 59(e) motion, because, in fact, the district court never considered 15(b) because it was never raised to the district court, that... that particular argument."
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.394,2820.366,"Well, that wasn't the basis that the Fifth Circuit relied on."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2827.303,2828.418,--That was part--
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.418,2830.275,"And there's a lot of question about that, it seems to me."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2830.275,2831.018,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-8286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.042,2849.966,"So maybe we should remand at... at least on the, you know, on the... on the Cook claim to have the... the Fifth Circuit decide whether a COA... decide the 15(b) question and then decide the Cook claim."
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2849.966,2860.99,"--I believe that would be an appropriate course on this issue, and in this... we are not... we are conceding the debatability of the general applicability of 15(b) in the habeas context."
2003.02-8286,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.222,2886.875,"But the Fifth Circuit passed on it, didn't it?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2891.416,2908.71,"The Fifth Circuit, after... after noting that what the Fifth... that... that the district court's findings regarding the failure to raise the claim, the failure to raise it in an amended petition, did hold that it was... that it... that 15(b) did not apply in the habeas context."
2003.02-8286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2908.71,2921.898,There was one petition you took in your brief and you said that... that the state is not obliged to reveal the identify of an informer.
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2926.749,2941.61,"No, Your Honor, that is our position that essentially a prosecutor's duty to disclose whatever information is triggered by the... the potential materiality of that information."
2003.02-8286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2958.14,2960.436,What authority... what authority do you have?
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,2973.439,2988.094,"--There... I know of no such authority for that particular proposition, but there's also nothing... there's also no opinion from this Court saying that a witness' informant status is per se material, which is essentially what... what that would--"
2003.02-8286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.094,3003.327,"Isn't there... isn't there a Texas rule of evidence that says, this is 508(c)(1) of the Texas rules, an informer's identity must be disclosed if he appears as a witness for the public entity?"
2003.02-8286,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,3003.327,3017.073,"--Well, Your Honor, again, even... even assuming a breach of a Federal rule of... state rule of evidence, that would not implicate the constitutional due process concerns at issue here."
