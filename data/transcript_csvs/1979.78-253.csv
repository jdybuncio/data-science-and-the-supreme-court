1979.78-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.854,We will hear arguments next in 78-253 and the consolidated cases.
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,13.861,19.261,"Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the Court."
1979.78-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,56.72,82.344,"At your convenience, Mr. Whitham, and perhaps your friends will comment on the same, first this case is here now because we have granted the writ, but are there any issues in this case that could not have been resolved after the District Courts have carried out the remand directions?"
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,82.344,127.264,"There is a great issue involved here, and I think it becomes even a greater issue, Mr. Chief Justice, in view of this Court's recent opinions in Columbus and Dayton of last July which in effect may well bring all of us, North and South, East and West, to a common problem if de jure segregation is now to be, in effect, arrived at either by old State law or constitution, or by the inability to overcome presumptions and evidentiary matters."
1979.78-253,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,629.996,631.385,And the percentages.
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,631.385,648.585,"And the percentages, and there, as to the Mexican-American scholastic population, has been an amazing increase in this 10-year period of 56.7 percent of Mexican-American children."
1979.78-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.181,744.749,Had the State constitution prior to 1954 required the segregation of Mexican-Americans?
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,744.749,746.094,"No, sir."
1979.78-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,764.266,774.612,"But in State constitution and/or statute, there had been a requirement of segregation of Negro students; is that it?"
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,774.612,774.922,Well --
1979.78-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,774.922,775.274,Until 1954.
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,775.274,776.145,Blacks.
1979.78-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,779.332,780.419,Said what?
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,780.419,786.142,"Said that children should be separated in school by race, black and white."
1979.78-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,787.512,789.651,And Mexican-Americans are white?
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,789.651,804.101,"Were treated as white, and had been for many years until the demands for cultural recognition of this very growing Mexican-American population has now caused that ethnic group to wish to be treated as a minority."
1979.78-253,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,804.101,809.797,But there was never de jure school segregation of that ethnic group; is that correct?
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,809.797,814.021,Never by State statute; never by State law.
1979.78-253,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,843.195,847.009,Are those maps before us duplicated in the appendix?
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,847.009,850.582,The maps that were handed out are not duplicated in the appendix.
1979.78-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.341,1135.632,"Well, when the district court conducts its time and distance studies, won't the court of appeals have a different problem?"
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,1135.632,1171.882,"If you conduct those time and distance studies, all the court of appeals will find is what all of the parties to this lawsuit knew and what the district judge knew, and the district judge has had this case in the palm of his hand for 10 years, and that is that the time and distance from where the Anglos live and where the predominantly minority areas are is too far and is beyond all of Swann's teachings with respect to transportation."
1979.78-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.152,1217.258,You may finish your sentence.
1979.78-253,0,46559,warren_whitham,,1217.258,1225.614,-- to come to grips in the urban society with an ever-growing.
1979.78-253,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1310.879,1318.396,"Very well, Mr. Whitham."
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1320.246,1338.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case, does the Constitution mandate forced transportation of students in the previously segregated State school system where private housing patterns are racially imbalanced, is one that concerns Curry."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1551.849,1553.278,"Mr. Blumenthal, may I interrupt?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1553.278,1554.318,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.318,1564.479,I read these briefs some little time ago and I remember that the Estes parties and the Curry parties and the Brinegar parties take differing positions.
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1564.479,1565.505,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.505,1574.2,We've heard from Mr. Whitham representing the Estes party who ask us that they are supporting the district court decree.
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1574.2,1575.583,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.583,1576.894,What is your basic position?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1576.894,1587.24,"Our basic position, sir, is to reverse both the district court and the court of appeals, to tell the district court that if it finds discrimination, remove it."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1608.001,1634.528,"Well, I don't think, in Judge McMillan's case, I don't think our Court -- perhaps I'm mistaken, but I don't think our Court has ever said that the Constitution mandates bussing of students, but simply that it's a permissible tool in a desegregation decree, once the court has found unconstitutional segregation."
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1635.611,1649.133,"But, sir, you've also imposed a presumption that any formerly State segregated school has had a system-wide violation, and a system-wide violation calls for a system-wide remedy, and the only system-wide remedy is forced transportation."
1979.78-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.042,1662.289,Why do you say that the only cure for a system-wide violation is bussing?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1662.289,1667.763,Because that's the only cure that the Fifth Circuit certainly has indicated is appropriate.
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1691.673,1693.292,Those are remedies permitted in Swann.
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1693.292,1694.069,Beg pardon?
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1694.069,1697.453,"They were not prescribed remedies in Swann, were they?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1697.453,1713.725,"Mr. Justice Stewart, the Fifth Circuit in the reading by the district courts certainly, if you read his record, read his statements to counsel, he is saying I am mandated to bus by the Fifth Circuit, and that's really the only fair reading of the 1976 opinion."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.171,1733.198,"And the district court's decree mandated so-called bussing of some what, 17,000?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1733.198,1741.454,"The last decree I believe mandated the bussing of some 17 to 20,000 of whom only about 10,000 are still in the school district."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1770.535,1775.454,"Well, the district court did not eliminate one-race schools, and that's what the court of appeals found wrong with it."
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1775.454,1783.447,"The district court only has 41,000 Anglo students left, and they cannot be distributed around the district like --"
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.447,1787.37,So what is it you quarrel about with the district court's decree?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1787.37,1809.136,"Well, the district court's decree in making its forced assignments has now removed us from a 57,000 Anglo student to 41, and the continuation of that decree is going to ultimately bring this into a racially isolated district in which no one can ever achieve the benefits of an integrated education."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.136,1812.181,That may or may not be post hoc reasoning.
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1813.868,1819.964,"Well, it was predicted precisely by the witnesses that Curry produced."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1865.031,1866.108,That it had ended on that day?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1866.108,1867.235,"No, that it would end."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1877.1,1891.7,"I'm trying to get at your position, Mr. Blumenthal, and perhaps I should be more familiar with it, I would be if I had read your brief more recently, but is it your position that the district court was in error in ordering any busing whatsoever?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1891.7,1897.145,It is our position that the district court was not in error in light of the Fifth Circuit's decision.
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.02,1924.87,Now -- go ahead and finish your sentence.
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1924.87,1930.517,"Then I think Curry would be, if you could say you don't have to bus, Curry would be pleased with the result."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.445,1936.354,That it is permissible but not mandatory; is that it?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1936.354,1949.558,"Permissible only to remedy some discriminatory purpose, but not mandatory, and you don't have to remove one-race schools unless those one-race schools were found to have been caused by the DISD."
1979.78-253,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1949.558,1950.249,Yes.
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,1950.249,1962.038,"Now, remember, the district court found that in 1971, I bussed 1,000 children to the high schools of which 50 were still here in 1976, five years later."
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.027,2022.104,"You are saying that bussing is permissible, but you must also be saying that there are plenty of circumstances in which it is forbidden to be used?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2025.97,2031.131,"It certainly is not, and I would say that --"
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2031.131,2035.424,But you don't think as a constitutional matter it ought to be banned?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2035.424,2039.799,"No, you don't need to ban it if you tell the district court that if you don't think this is going to work --"
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.799,2044.775,"And therefore you must concede, then, that in some circumstances it may be ordered."
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2044.775,2049.898,"In some circumstances, but only if it has some prospect of working, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.898,2050.37,All right.
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2055.645,2058.717,"Yes, I --"
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.717,2068.216,"You don't think the court of appeals says, well, Mr. Blumenthal, we understand your rule, but we're going to order this bussing even though we think it has absolutely no chance to work whatsoever?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2068.216,2071.404,In fact they said that very thing in Lee v. Macon County --
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.404,2072.9,But did they say it in this case?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2072.9,2080.183,"No, sir, but they did say that we think the Swann mandates bussing, even though we know it will not desegregate."
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.183,2090.514,"Perhaps you could just give me a little indication of where you think the court of appeals came the closest to saying, we're ordering this bussing or this review even though we have no hope that it will work at all?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2090.514,2092.126,In Lee v. Macon County --
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.126,2093.534,Where does it say it in this case?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2093.534,2093.993,Beg pardon?
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.993,2095.114,Where does it say it in this case?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2095.114,2096.543,In this case they didn't say it.
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.751,2106.922,"And where is, then -- what's the site for the Lee?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2106.922,2112.261,"The Lee v. Macon County, it's in our --"
1979.78-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.261,2113.38,It's in your brief?
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2113.38,2116.28,"It's in our brief; yes, sir."
1979.78-253,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2123.469,2129.954,"To pursue Mr. Justice Stewart's question, the relief you really ask is that the complaint be dismissed, isn't it?"
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2129.954,2153.815,"On the basis of this record with no discrimination to be remedied, yes, sir, because we agreed on a majority-minority school district, we've agreed on it, the community is supporting it -- look at the high schools which are today neighborhood high schools with majority to minority; set out in our brief is a racial breakdown of those high schools."
1979.78-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2209.238,2229.773,"Now, your reference to what, at least I thought you suggested was a holding concerning bussing in Swann, the opinion states, ""No rigid guidelines as to student transportation can be given for application to the infinite variety of problems presented in thousands of situations."""
1979.78-253,1,38657,robert_l_blumenthal,,2244.722,2257.532,"But the 5th Circuit has not applied it in that way, and the eloquence of turning those busses around that were used to segregate to use to desegregate is so appealing, and yet the fact of the matter is that it doesn't work."
1979.78-253,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2270.905,2271.851,Mr. Donohoe.
1979.78-253,2,29876,james_a_donohoe,,2271.851,2272.028,Yes.
1979.78-253,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2292.776,2294.206,Where is that area on the map?
1979.78-253,2,29876,james_a_donohoe,,2294.206,2299.814,"It would be in the eastern, near eastern portion of the school district, Justice Stewart."
1979.78-253,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2299.814,2300.555,Here?
1979.78-253,2,29876,james_a_donohoe,,2300.555,2305.333,"Yes, that's correct."
1979.78-253,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.181,2520.65,Mr. Wallace.
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2520.65,2559.258,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States submits that the court of appeals was correct in this case in remanding the case for further consideration of the remedy and for more specific factual findings, and in light of the limited nature of the court of appeals' holding some of the questions being argued before the Court today seem to us prematurely presented because they involve matters that the court of appeals has not yet passed on, and believes it needs to have a fuller record before it can pass on them."
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2585.672,2592.82,"Now, the question before the court of appeals and the question before us is not a constitutional question at all, is it?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2597.551,2599.1,It's a remedial question.
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2599.1,2599.547,Correct.
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2599.547,2601.52,It can be debated whether --
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.52,2603.485,What is there to debate about?
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2603.485,2604.356,Whether the --
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2604.356,2609.634,There's an admission that there was a constitutional violation until 1954.
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2609.634,2610.625,That's correct.
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2610.625,2614.532,"This is just a matter of permissible decree, isn't it?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2614.532,2617.666,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-253,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.549,2646.712,Or Northern.
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2646.712,2654.82,"It is familiar in some of those as well, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-253,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.407,2734.839,"When you say minority students, does that include Mexican-American?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2734.839,2743.972,"In some instances it does, Mr. Justice, although it's principally isolation of black children that's involved."
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2811.216,2828.734,"Don't you suppose, Mr. Wallace, that very similar statistics could be -- wouldn't be true of Detroit or Pittsburgh or Cincinnati or New York City, or many, many cities whose states had never had, either by statute or constitutional, de jure segregation?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2828.734,2840.896,"There could be a very similar pattern of school assignments, yes, Mr. Justice, but the legal question presented might be quite different."
1979.78-253,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.426,2918.884,"Well, wasn't it the finding in the Detroit case that -- undisputed finding -- that the proportion of students in the so-called one-race schools was greater than you have here, and that the number of one-race schools, just counting the schools, was greater than you have here?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2918.884,2948.533,This can occur due to residential patterns in cities where there may have been some de jure acts that added to segregation in those cases under this Court's decision require an inquiry into the incremental effect of de jure acts on the racial separation that otherwise would have existed as a guide to the remedy that should be used.
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3039.541,3043.095,I thought we agreed we weren't talking about whether or not this is constitutionally adequate.
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3043.095,3047.396,"Well, upheld as adequate for a constitutional violation --"
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3047.396,3055.811,"It's not your contention, is it, or is it, that the Constitution of the United States requires an integrated school system?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3055.811,3057.337,That is not our contention.
1979.78-253,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3057.337,3059.28,It simply requires a desegregated school system?
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3059.28,3061.665,It requires a desegregated school system.
1979.78-253,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3181.184,3185.835,"Mr. Wallace, does EOC stand for East Oak Cliff?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3185.835,3186.981,That is my understanding.
1979.78-253,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3186.981,3188.38,And is this East Oak Cliff?
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3188.38,3190.401,That is the area.
1979.78-253,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3224.469,3229.062,"Mr. Wallace, have you thought about the question I put to your friend?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3240.346,3243.068,"Nothing, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-253,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.697,3271.844,"Mr. Wallace, may I ask you a question in that connection?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3296.756,3298.728,I think it is very regrettable --
1979.78-253,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.728,3299.122,Does the United States Government --
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3299.122,3302.816,"-- that it has taken as long as it has, and --"
1979.78-253,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.816,3305.27,You want it to go back for another two to five years of litigation?
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3305.27,3315.404,"No, I just suggested one course that could be adopted to enable the proceedings on remand to take place sooner than they otherwise might."
1979.78-253,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3347.727,3351.317,"We could affirm the district court, could we not?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3351.317,3361.242,"Well that, it seems to me, would require reconsideration of matters that the Court reconsidered and came up the other way on last July."
1979.78-253,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.242,3365.658,You see no difference between this case and Dayton and Columbus?
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3365.658,3386.512,"Well, in many ways this case seems to me to follow a fortiori from Dayton and Columbus, Mr. Justice, because it's so much closer to the Mobile case, as I have just been indicating, and because the other point that I was about to make, more than half of the grades were completely left out of the desegregation plan by the district court."
1979.78-253,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3395.449,3405.995,"Well, doesn't the district court have some discretion when it comes to very young children in saying there shall be less bussing with respect to them than with respect to older children?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3405.995,3410.262,Some discretion based on adequate factual inquiry and findings.
1979.78-253,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.262,3410.889,Didn't Swann --
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3410.889,3414.792,"-- the part about grades 9 through 12, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-253,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3414.792,3417.684,"Didn't Swann say precisely that, Mr. Wallace?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3417.684,3420.283,"Swann did say that, and I answered consistently with that answer."
1979.78-253,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3420.283,3423.052,"With young children, there was to be a different approach with younger children?"
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3423.052,3430.563,"Young children are being bussed, including some children in grades 1, 2, and 3 in the Dallas system today."
1979.78-253,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.197,3447.205,"Mr. Wallace, may I put this question to you."
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3479.435,3481.173,"Not at all, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-253,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3481.173,3485.041,The district court found that this was a most effective plan.
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3495.827,3504.996,"I cannot accept the premise, Mr. Justice, that this was an intractable problem as the record presented it before the district court --"
1979.78-253,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3504.996,3511.593,Would you be content with wholly one-race schools or two-race schools in the City of Dallas?
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3511.593,3528.112,There were a number of plans before the district court that showed that a much higher degree of desegregation could be achieved and no specific findings were made about why those plans were impracticable within the meaning of this court's governing considerations.
1979.78-253,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3544.912,3548.204,May I ask one question before you sit down?
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3588.251,3591.627,The court of appeals said nothing to preclude this.
1979.78-253,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.501,3596.628,I understand.
1979.78-253,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3596.628,3601.81,But it seems to me the nature of the court of appeals' holding is an extremely limited one here.
1979.78-253,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3609.415,3610.383,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,3620.203,3671.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court, on behalf of the NAACP, it is the NAACP's position that this is a dual segregated de jure system that has never been desegregated, and that it is not desegregated by the student assignment plan that was adopted by the district judge in this case in accordance with the instructions that were given to the district judge in 1975, directing that district judge specifically to this Court's holding in Swann and directing that district judge to use the tools and techniques set out in Swann."
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4012.501,4024.375,"Are a majority of the one-race schools, at least of the all-Negro schools, in this East Oak Cliff?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4024.375,4028.37,There are 28 one-race schools in the East Oak Cliff.
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4028.37,4029.022,How many?
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4029.022,4029.754,28.
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4029.754,4030.68,28.
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4030.68,4036.691,The rest are in the other four sub-districts that were created by the district judge.
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4036.691,4039.164,And what was the total of all-Negro schools?
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4039.164,4042.189,28 in East Oak Cliff sub-district.
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4042.189,4048.515,The total?
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4048.515,4053.759,There are a total of 62 one-race schools.
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4053.759,4055.687,But does that mean all-Negro schools?
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4057.369,4071.105,"There are 52 one-race schools, black schools; 9 one-race Anglo schools; and 1 Mexican-American one-race school existing in the Dallas Independent School District."
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4071.105,4077.038,"And of those, 28 of the all-Negro schools are in East Oak Cliff, right?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4077.038,4079.051,In the East Oak Cliff area.
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4088.603,4093.638,Uh-huh.
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4093.638,4113.575,"The student assignment plan also in excluding kindergarten dash 3, the NAACP submits that there were no factual findings to justify the exclusion of these students from inclusion in the plan."
1979.78-253,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4171.254,4185.434,"Mr. Cunningham, is it your position that the district court was bound to adopt the plan which in your words most desegregated the school district of the ones submitted to it?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4185.434,4201.421,I think that the district judge under this Court's holding had a duty to adopt the plan that desegregated Dallas and utilizing the tools in Swann.
1979.78-253,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4201.421,4205.628,"Well, he had what, was it five or six plans submitted to him?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4205.628,4207.26,He had six plans submitted to him.
1979.78-253,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4207.26,4216.41,"Is it your position that he was obligated to adopt, of those six, the one which most desegregated the school district?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4216.41,4225.832,He was obligated to so adopt the plan that most desegregated Dallas.
1979.78-253,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4254.073,4270.936,"Mr. Cunningham, back in 1972 in the case to which your colleague on the other side referred, Lee against Macon County -- are you familiar with that case?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4270.936,4273.676,"I have read that case, Your Honor."
1979.78-253,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4273.676,4319.157,"As I read it, the court of appeals seemed to say that even if this desegregation order would result in complete resegregation -- I think there were six schools there black, or some number of schools that were black and a much fewer number of schools that were white, but those were all the schools there were, and the desegregation order was supposed to result in integrating those schools, and the court said even if complete resegregation would result, we nevertheless must order this plan into effect, order the HEW plan into effect."
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4323.563,4324.56,We support --
1979.78-253,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4324.56,4328.811,Do you understand it that way?
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4328.811,4339.872,"If I understand, Mr. Justice White, we are dealing with Dallas, and --"
1979.78-253,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4339.872,4365.884,"Well, my next question is going to be, to you, of course, that your colleague suggests that much of the court of appeals' opinion and decision in this case rests on an understanding of the law such as that, namely that except for their feeling that the resegregated consequences of an integration plan is irrelevant."
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4385.745,4420.39,"The present decision rests upon -- I think the court of appeals below's decision rests upon this Court's holdings, in Brown 1, 2, Green, and particularly Swann, because on -- this is the second time that the court of appeals has directed this district judge to look at the tools set out by this Court in Swann and to apply those tools and techniques to the desegregation of the Dallas Independent School District."
1979.78-253,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4420.39,4447.57,"Do you think the district court on a remand such has been suggested in this case is -- is he forbidden or is he permitted to take into account, in formulating his plan, whether or not a particular plan that has been suggested will result in further resegregation ultimately, or white flight or black flight? Is he forbidden to take that into account?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4447.57,4481.989,"I think that he may take that into account, but I think that the NAACP's position is that still taking that into consideration, his first consideration, the first consideration are the minority children that are being desegregated, and seeing that their constitutional rights are protected and guaranteed, and that is what the NAACP says was not done."
1979.78-253,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4481.989,4521.417,"So the NAACP was just as certain as it could be from experience that bussing, this cross-bussing would result in these black children next year or the year afterwards nevertheless going to an all-black school because there wouldn't be any whites or any people of any other color to go to school with, even if the NAACP was convinced by experience that that would occur, would you still be arguing what you are now, that you must take that first step?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4521.417,4533.212,The NAACP would still be arguing the same position that it's arguing now and that it argued in the court of appeals below and in the district court.
1979.78-253,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4533.212,4536.769,May I put it a little bit differently?
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4546.993,4552.872,"Mr. Justice Powell, I think that is speculation."
1979.78-253,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4552.872,4560.751,But don't you think that the record suggests that it might or probably will?
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4560.751,4601.37,"That is the district judge's finding based upon speculation, but we have here a plan in effect which shows that the student enrollment is constant, that all that there has been, and no white -- well, white flight, as this Court said in Swann, should not be, or should not be a reason for denying minority children their right guaranteed to them by the Constitution."
1979.78-253,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4601.37,4608.801,"Their right is to go to schools which are in a desegregated system, and that's the extent of their right, isn't it?"
1979.78-253,4,22120,e_brice_cunningham,,4608.801,4623.109,"That is the extent of their right, Mr. Justice Stewart, sir."

1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,4624.76,4661.013,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, on behalf of the respondent Tasby and others, original plaintiffs in the trial below in the trial since 1970, we support the conclusion reached by the United States Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit, which is a very simple and I believe direct order, simply requesting of the trial court to make further findings regarding a new student assignment plan as to any one-race schools he deemed to be necessary, and necessary for purposes of all the factors articulated in Swann."
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4661.013,4670.801,"May he take into account the possibilities of whites moving out of the public school system, or may he not, in your view?"

1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4677.807,4678.976,So is your answer yes or no?
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,4678.976,4682.933,"My answer is not necessarily yes, based upon the record in the Dallas case."
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4700.463,4708.279,"The record doesn't show why the percentage of whites in the Dallas school system is so much lower than it was, or does it?"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,4708.279,4715.455,"The record shows many expert opinions as to what might have happened, what might happen in the future, and those are divergent --"
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4715.455,4718.062,I didn't ask about the opinions.
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,4722.83,4725.679,You're asking if the Anglo enrollment has decreased; it has.
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4734.353,4736.632,Yes.
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,4741.781,4744.461,There may be several.
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4744.461,4747.722,-- that hasn't been particularly upset by anything.

1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4763.671,4768.917,You mean you don't have to use either those blacks or those whites to integrate some other schools?

1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5058.549,5059.846,Yes.
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5059.846,5063.22,"-- ""must necessarily remain predominantly minority"" --"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5063.22,5067.025,The court is making a conclusion in its opinion with no record evidence to support it.
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5080.088,5081.558,Does this judge live in Dallas?
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5081.558,5082.286,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5082.286,5085.304,He was unfamiliar with the distances?
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5085.304,5088.569,"He had not measured them himself, I don't believe, and there was certainly no evidence he did."
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5088.569,5090.223,"These maps show the distances, don't they?"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5090.223,5092.322,"No, Your Honor, not accurate."
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5096.365,5100.784,"Of course, but do you really think that --"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5100.784,5107.956,"I think that only an expert can tell us with any certainly not only what distances are, but what times are going to be like."
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5107.956,5110.854,You'd have to lay out specific bus routes from school to school.
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5110.854,5111.983,"That's correct, and --"
1979.78-253,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5111.983,5114.84,"And an expert presumably wouldn't measure it on a Sunday afternoon, would he?"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5114.84,5115.96,That is correct.
1979.78-253,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5115.96,5132.627,"How about the finding on page 34A of the petition for writ of certiorari, the district court's opinion of, I think it's March 1976; ""Moreover, this court must adopt the plan which promises to be effective in eliminating the vestiges of the dual system."
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5150.264,5164.984,"The court tried in 1971, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, a high school assignment plan to which it in whole abandoned, and in part because the court assigned, for instance, 100 white students to a thousand-person black school and students in that case did not show up."
1979.78-253,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5164.984,5176.805,But at least the district court did make a finding that the magnet school system would be more effective than the transportation and assigning students on a racial basis to high schools.
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5182.795,5186.488,"The fact is, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there is no record to support his conclusions."
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5230.662,5236.101,Suppose the magnet high school had worked in the sense that everybody showed up.
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5238.815,5240.245,Absolutely.
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5242.336,5242.897,Well then --
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5242.897,5244.022,Or a lot of cars.
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5244.022,5246.419,"So what was it, a voluntary magnet high school?"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5246.419,5248.249,"That's right, and I'm glad you asked that."
1979.78-253,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5248.249,5262.521,"So why wouldn't the, if the voluntary magnet high school would have involved a lot of bussing, it wouldn't have involved any more bussing if there had been assignments to the magnet high school?"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5262.521,5271.757,"That's entirely correct, Mr. Justice White, and as a matter of fact, those bus routes, since many of the magnets are district-wide, are as long as the ones the court says it can't use that are too long."
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5274.737,5284.941,"Do you think it did make a difference in the case of the magnet schools that the parents were making a voluntary choice for their children, rather than a Federal district judge?"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5311.963,5319.767,"Mr. Justice Powell, you're correct and that is the -- in the latter assumption that there are special programs being offered to schools."
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5337.828,5340.437,How many magnet schools do you have in operation?
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5340.437,5343.279,I believe there are 6 or 7 in operation.
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5343.279,5346.996,"But additional ones are either under construction or planned, aren't they?"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5346.996,5348.649,That is my understanding.
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5348.649,5355.018,Is it a fact that the community down there approved an $80 million school bond issue following this court decree?
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5355.018,5359.974,"We approved a bond issue following, approved bond issues during litigation, as a matter of fact."
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5359.974,5362.419,Does the district court plan have the support of the community?
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5364.735,5366.076,"Your Honor, that is wholly speculative."
1979.78-253,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5372.401,5373.081,Obviously.
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5373.081,5375.806,"Many of them, at least."
1979.78-253,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5424.229,5425.413,"Well now, how do you know that?"
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5425.413,5427.463,Because we --
1979.78-253,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5427.463,5434.818,"You could find the same situation in big urban areas which were never, never had a dual school system."
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5435.501,5446.91,"I know for a fact that 37 schools that were one race black under the pre stair-step plan continue to be part of the 52 black schools today, and that is a vestige, clear and simple."
1979.78-253,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5446.91,5450.017,"Well, you don't know that any more than I know that."
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5450.017,5451.523,I know they were black before that; I know they're black now.
1979.78-253,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5451.523,5464.012,You can find the same sort of statistics in Pittsburgh or Cincinnati or Detroit or Chicago or New York City which never had dual school systems de jure.
1979.78-253,5,22049,edward_b_cloutman_iii,,5469.44,5471.526,"Very simple, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-253,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5510.135,5512.74,Very well.
1979.78-253,6,46559,warren_whitham,,5514.389,5519.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, I knew my time was up, but I understand Mr. Donohoe had yielded --"
