2001.01-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.031,"We'll hear argument now on number 01-584, Wanda Adams vs. Florida Power Corporation and Florida Progress Corporation."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,11.972,22.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: There are three core reasons why the Court should hold the disparate impact is an available method of proof in age discrimination cases."
2001.01-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,34.513,47.061,"Mr. Crabtree, we are not talking about a situation where you are claiming that the fact of disparate impact gives rise to a permissible inference of intentional discrimination."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,51.064,51.641,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,63.53,80.786,"Well, now in Washington against Davis, we held that disparate impact was not enough by itself under the statute or Constitution that you could infer from it an intent to discriminate."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,92.137,118.986,"We believe it does support an inference of an intent, an intent that does not need to be proven, that it justifies that it can justify the necessity for the doctrine because without it, it would be easy for an employer to conceal its intent for example, an employer could choose a device like a five-year rule in which they said that we won't hire anybody with more than five years' experience or we'll have speed tests."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,118.986,135.027,"That's a very handy prophylactic rule, but with it, once you, once you acknowledge that indeed the malicious intent is necessary with it, with the rule that you propose, you are going to get a lot of employers that have no such malicious intent."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,135.027,142.086,"Justice Scalia, we are not suggesting that malicious intent is required at all for disparate impact."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,144.149,148.115,You just say it is bad in itself.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,152.944,154.263,--That's certainly true.
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.378,162.232,"Because if the only reason it's bad is because it shows malicious intent, my goodness, it seems to me it goes much too far."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,175.812,178.595,"That's certainly true, and definitely, the doctrine goes beyond that."
2001.01-584,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.554,192.697,"Well, you want us to consider the case on the assumption that the employer has no intent to discriminate."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,202.933,204.707,"--In many instances, that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-584,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.707,205.329,And that's your position.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,205.329,206.072,That is our position.
2001.01-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.648,207.269,Okay.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,209.165,210.651,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,210.651,216.019,"May I ask, because it's always helpful to me to know, what's at stake in the particular case."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,221.22,230.525,"We have alleged in this case that the employer's reduction in force has had a disparate impact upon the older workers, the selection device of the older workers."
2001.01-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,230.525,241.654,"Are you saying reductions in force are always practices that if they have a disparate impact, give rise to a, an age discrimination claim?"
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,241.654,251.769,"No, Your Honor, because in virtually every instance where there is reduction in force it will be quite easy for the employer to satisfy the defense under the reasonable factors of the age provision of the act."
2001.01-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,251.769,254.945,What is different about the reduction in force in this case?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,254.945,272.861,"Well, in this case, Your Honor, as the district court acknowledged in its opinion that we are proceeding from, we had evidence that the highest levels that the decision to undertake the downsizing was actually a decision to get rid of, intended to get rid of older workers."
2001.01-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,272.861,275.007,That's the disparate treatment claim?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,275.007,293.379,"Unfortunately, it's not, Your Honor, because as the district court judge acknowledged, we could not make a disparate treatment case under these facts because in the disparate treatment case, we would still have to prove, unless we could make a cat's paw analysis that the actual decision maker harbored an animus against the employee that's terminated."
2001.01-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.59,322.44,"But this is what I... excuse me for interrupting, but is it the decision to downsize that it has to be reasonable or the particular discharge decisions on each individual have to be reasonable?"
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,322.44,328.506,--We have identified in this case the action of the employer as being the decision to downsize itself.
2001.01-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.506,331.274,The decision to downsize itself?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,331.274,338.454,Which Mr. Most instances will be much more difficult probably for plaintiffs than it would be if you want on a more micro-level.
2001.01-584,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,339.176,340.933,Why would it be more difficult?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,347.62,351.845,"--Will, it would have to be a substantially disparate impact between the two groups."
2001.01-584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.981,365.369,I thought you conceded that it was not enough for you to show disparate impact.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,413.008,428.256,"Well, what we are saying is this, is that the Court indicated in Wards Cove that the plaintiff in an age... in a discrimination case is to identify a specific practice or action by an employer that results in disparate impact that cannot be justified."
2001.01-584,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,438.93,442.274,Why don't we leave motive out of it for purposes... forget motive.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,500.436,502.173,--We are defending that proposition.
2001.01-584,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.203,504.318,Okay.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,517.981,526.609,"Well, we believe it's the law because the prohibitions themselves as construed in Griggs apply to actions and then the reasonable--"
2001.01-584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,526.609,544.73,"Well, the background in Griggs was racial discrimination, and the policies there seem to me to rest on a long history of societal and historical bias against black people."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,549.438,550.842,"--No, Justice O'Connor, we do not."
2001.01-584,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.842,554.473,So it might be quite a different proposition here.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,554.473,556.536,"Respectfully, no, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.684,593.111,That's a good idea.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,597.857,598.396,"Sure, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.845,642.873,"In each of those cases, Mr. Crabtree, it says because of such individual's age."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,646.217,647.415,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.823,692.118,"I would think it relates to, to the limit, segregate or classify."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,692.118,699.344,"It cannot, Your Honor, because the word his employees follows those words."
2001.01-584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.344,712.84,"In any event, the wording is identical to Title VII, and Title VII on that words has been held to have this differential impact theory for sex, as well as race."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,712.84,714.492,"That's absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.899,737.998,Was this language adopted in this form after it had been clearly established that the Title VII language did include disparate impact?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,740.583,741.463,"Oh, it did not."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.463,742.002,We held that.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,745.041,746.172,"It was before, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,748.385,749.992,"After Title VII, but before Griggs?"
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,749.992,750.614,--That's correct.
2001.01-584,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.471,795.772,"But it seems to me that even if we accept your reading of the statute which I am not sure is the more natural reading, you still have because of such individual's age, that is to say what you would call disparate impact, what the statute says adverse impact must still be because of such individual's age and if we think because of, implies or necessarily requires a bad purpose, you still had the same problem."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,795.772,803.946,"If because of did require a bad purpose, we would, however, there is two reasons why we can, why it is not."
2001.01-584,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.38,817.32,I know you are going to the second.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,838.868,846.77,"Again, we are relating because of back to the effect of the individual and we are relying upon the court's interpretation of that language in Griggs."
2001.01-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.77,859.302,"Well, one, one might feel that Griggs is stare decisis because it could feel that perhaps it reasonably would not readily be extended if there was some reason for distinguishing it."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,859.302,861.243,That might make sense.
2001.01-584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,867.187,892.246,"But as... may I go back to the question that we opened with, and that is I don't know of any case under Title VII where someone could just say reduction in force affected more women than men, therefore, I have an impact case or reduction in force, it affected more minorities than majorities so therefore."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,931.831,933.401,"Your Honor, two answers."
2001.01-584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,965.557,971.584,"I don't think that the district court finding allows you to say the standard, the standard is the reduction itself because the district judge said that the people involved held a wide variety of jobs, were managed and supervised by different people and were terminated at different times by different decision makers based on different considerations of criteria, and that seems to me just wholly to reject that there is a rule or a standard."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,971.584,1021.08,The reason why we believe it's important to be able to do the analysis with the reduction of force being the action is because otherwise it would allow an employer to purposely choose to do a reduction in force to get rid of its older workers where there is a corporate culture pervaded by ageism and have consequences as it did here where it greatly reduced the age of its work force.
2001.01-584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.08,1033.19,"What is your closest precedent under Title VII dealing with race or dealing with sex where you have something so groundly general as a reduction in force with different decisions, different standards, different times?"
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1033.19,1038.374,There are cases dealing with reduction of force under Title VII.
2001.01-584,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1050.513,1055.01,And nothing more specific than a reduction in force?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1055.01,1058.741,"Candidly, Justice Ginsburg, I don't recall."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.741,1071.357,"Mr. Crabtree, I thought the question on which we granted certiorari was not whether this particular claim of disparate impact was too general or not specific enough."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1080.273,1081.638,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.638,1095.095,And I would hope you would address Justice Breyer's question in which he said why should we do this to say that tenured employees are the higher salaried employees?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1100.707,1107.105,"Well, in most instances, employer is going to be able to explain why he engages in any selection of process."
2001.01-584,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1107.105,1111.071,"Most instances, they can't explain it very well."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1144.44,1159.861,"And that may very well be why Congress chose to use the result factors other than age language, and that is why there are, although we don't agree with them, why there were good intellectual arguments that reasonable factors other than age is something less than business necessity."
2001.01-584,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.802,1164.236,What would your test be?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1175.276,1177.201,We believe that the term is ambiguous.
2001.01-584,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1181.205,1184.464,Say what I think the form of words is?
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1184.464,1189.294,That it is that the employer must justify the action as being business necessity.
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.294,1200.235,"But reasonable factors other than age provision doesn't really solve Justice Breyer's problem, does it, because it puts the burden on the employer to establish that, doesn't it?"
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1200.235,1201.267,"It does, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.267,1205.103,"So you are still in a situation where the employer said well he could have done it a lot of different ways and you are saying I'm sorry, that's no good."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1205.103,1214.846,"But if the employer must only show that its action was reasonable, it is not as demanding as showing that it was necessary."
2001.01-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1214.846,1218.357,You said emphasize reason.
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.357,1219.016,It's still a burden on him.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1219.016,1221.45,It is still a burden on him.
2001.01-584,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1222.072,1226.918,May I go back to the--
2001.01-584,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1226.918,1228.304,--Please.
2001.01-584,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1228.304,1239.383,"May I go back to your argument of a minute ago that the, that the various defenses make no sense except on the disparate impact theory possibility of disparate impact theory."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1249.109,1261.203,They don't make sense on the mixed motive analysis because in the mixed motive analysis there is still an issue as to whether or not the employer's illegal motive caused an illegal action.
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.621,1351.732,"Mr. Crabtree, could I just come back for a moment to, to your argument which I think is an important one that some of the defenses don't make sense unless there is a discriminatory impact basis."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1406.261,1414.64,"Well, when you are observing the terms of a seniority system, you know, you may be looking at age directly."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.984,1426.323,"Well, no, I don't, I don't know any seniority systems that go on the basis of people's age as opposed to how long they have been working there."
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1430.616,1435.157,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.928,1451.504,It's redundant.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1482.794,1487.087,"--You might be able to make that argument, but it is not the most logical argument."
2001.01-584,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1516.603,1517.801,I don't want.
2001.01-584,0,29590,john_crabtree,,1557.675,1559.056,"That's certainly true, Justice Kennedy."
2001.01-584,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.476,1584.691,"Very well, Mr. Crabtree."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1586.448,1603.827,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I may, I'd like to address why fully consistent and giving full respect to Griggs vs. Duke Power Company, this Court can and should hold that the age discrimination and employment act does not make--"
2001.01-584,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1603.827,1606.982,Even though the language is essentially the same?
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1606.982,1608.945,"--Justice O'Connor, it's not."
2001.01-584,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1706.904,1723.167,"I thought you were going to tell us that because of age, is within of your strongest points, and as Justice O'Connor said, that's the same language structure that we had in Griggs, and that we would have to interpret them differently."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1723.167,1725.109,"You are right, Justice Kennedy."
2001.01-584,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1725.109,1734.684,"But, but, but then you automatically throw me over I guess to part (f) and talk about reasonable factors other than age, which is exactly what the petition wanted to--"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1734.684,1737.674,"That's my lack of clarity, Justice Kennedy."
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.965,1760.775,--May I just interrupt.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1770.517,1782.239,"Yes, Justice Stevens, because the structure of the statute says that the employer can't limit, segregate or classify his employees in a way that has an adverse effect on an individual."
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.239,1782.899,On any individual.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1782.899,1785.045,Because of such individual's age.
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1785.045,1785.667,Correct.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1788.639,1789.298,No.
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1802.756,1806.843,Even though the former is plural and the because of is singular?
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1806.843,1809.36,Because the sentence has to be read as a whole.
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.881,1817.367,Right.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1817.367,1818.482,But the--
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.482,1819.391,You said it perfectly.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1819.391,1837.019,"--It is... I would grant you that it is not the most elegantly written sentence in the world, but I would also urge upon you, Your Honor, that the comma in that sentence grammatically compels that the because of phrase modifies the to limit, segregate or classify."
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1837.019,1842.425,"Your view is well, Title VII, the court really got it wrong."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1883.664,1888.289,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm not here to challenge Griggs in any respect."
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.035,1906.243,"I mean, we look at the whole statute, as you said, not just the comma."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1906.243,1908.284,That's the point.
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.284,1912.066,"The comma could be outweighed by other factors in one statute, and not in the other."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1912.066,1915.903,And that is what the court has found in its Title VII cases.
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.903,1917.555,"Comma is not a very big thing, is it?"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1917.555,1918.669,"I'm sorry, could you--"
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.669,1920.155,I say a comma is not a very big thing.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1920.155,1933.159,"--Well, it is part of the statute, and we think it has to be taken into account, but our argument that the age discrimination employment act should not be allowed to recognize disparate impact claims does not rest solely on the comma."
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1965.581,1972.085,"Well, I can see you point to (f) in the reasonableness because there is no counterpart to that in Title VII, but frankly--"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1972.085,1972.828,That's--
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1972.828,1978.029,"--Frankly, I would find it unseemly to take the identical words and say we ignore the comma in one case."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1982.505,1985.255,"--I don't think it's unseemly at all, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.255,1986.491,If you are wrong the first time.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1986.491,1988.349,"Well, I'm not here to take--"
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.349,1994.831,Which stare decisis would require us to accept for Title VII but wouldn't require us to accept for this statute.
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1994.831,1997.06,"That's the very point I made to you, and you rejected it."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1997.903,2021.293,"--Justice Ginsburg, this Court has on any number of occasions, and I'll use the Chief Justice's opinion in Fogerty vs. Fantasy in as administration said that identical language in two separate statutes can be given two different meanings by this Court if a single meaning isn't compelled by the words themselves and if the statute it different purposes or different legislative history."
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2022.9,2032.726,"--But here we know even though Griggs didn't come until sometime later, the Congress did, when it wrote the Age Discrimination Act, it did copy quite deliberately the Title VII language."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2032.726,2034.583,That is true.
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2040.612,2051.757,"But that's a different argument, looking at the statute as a whole and saying whatever the first part means, here we have another part that's absent from Title VII so we don't have to interpret it the same way."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2051.757,2052.621,--I have two points.
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.94,2107.873,"What you do you do in the argument, which I think is an interesting one, that it is a reasonable factors other than age requirement."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2107.873,2109.259,It is--
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.259,2118.464,"If, if there were an intent requirement in the act, it wouldn't matter whether you are using reasonable factors or not, so long as you are not using age."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2129.238,2145.025,"--As you have pointed out, Justice Scalia, it's perfectly appropriate for Congress to clarify and make unambiguous in any respect conceivable that it does not want any decision that's based upon a reasonable factor to be subject to liability under this statute."
2001.01-584,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2145.685,2178.09,"Okay, but that argument is equally compatible with the position that your brother is taking on the other side, and if you take the ambiguity that is left, and you combine it with the argument that Justice Ginsburg is making about the parallel language with Title VII, doesn't it lead you to say all right, the parallel language is answered only by an argument which in fact is, boils down to an ambiguity and an ambiguity doesn't defeat the policy of construing like statutes, like drafted statutes in a like manner."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2178.09,2179.643,--The answer to that is no.
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.368,2198.44,Why does it have to be a reasonable factor other than age?
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2209.114,2210.518,--You absolutely can.
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.086,2226.121,"So you say it's a safe harbor provision for sure if it's a reasonable factor other than age, it's okay?"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2226.121,2229.798,"And it tells us more than that, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-584,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2256.919,2261.377,"I don't really understand... I must say, I don't entirely follow the argument."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2280.175,2281.106,--Bad news for us.
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.106,2282.758,Bad news for any of us.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2301.251,2309.303,"The legislative history and the secretary's report makes quite clear why they put the reasonable in there, because they were concerned about the mixed motive cases."
2001.01-584,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.323,2353.552,"Yes, but why is that necessary to deal with mixed motive?"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2363.295,2381.871,"Well, every time that the mixed motive issue has been discussed, this Court in construing Title VII, in construing the National Labor Relations Act, in construing the Constitution, the 1983 and Mt."
2001.01-584,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2439.002,2459.685,"Well, what, what does seem to weaken the argument is leaving even aside the mixed motive argument, you were, you are arguing that a reasonable factor test is proof that in fact it was a, an, a malicious motive-based liability in the first place."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2470.459,2471.574,That's correct.
2001.01-584,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2471.574,2488.171,"And the odd thing is that you are saying that by specifying a reasonable factor defense, Congress was indicating that there would be an unreasonable factor defense because reasonable or unreasonable, if it's not age, there is no liability."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2500.885,2528.416,"I think the answer to that question is that reasonableness goes, is a permissible, the reasonableness of a nondiscriminatory factor that an employer offers is something that a judge can consider and if he finds a disputed issue of fact, a jury can consider in deciding whether or not the nondiscriminatory factor that is offered is a pretext for age discrimination."
2001.01-584,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2528.416,2530.729,But if you really held that reason.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2544.558,2545.689,Correct.
2001.01-584,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2545.689,2548.273,"As an evidentiary point, I see it."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2553.12,2562.558,"Well, I understand your point, Justice Souder, and I will be the first to acknowledge this case would be easier if the word reasonable weren't there."
2001.01-584,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2568.641,2573.249,"Is there anywhere we can go, is there any way if you were finished, were you?"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2573.249,2574.568,"Well, I just wanted to make the following point."
2001.01-584,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2636.983,2645.695,"Is there any way, which I'm sure you don't want to bring up necessarily, but is there any way short of saying there is never a disparate impact claim?"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2664.764,2666.416,That's true.
2001.01-584,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2666.416,2674.135,"On the other hand, you might have some rules that are really correlated with age very heavily and have no justification."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2683.34,2686.395,"Well, there is a way of dealing with it."
2001.01-584,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.312,2714.259,That denies my hypothetical.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2733.95,2737.089,"Well, I can only answer the question the following two ways."
2001.01-584,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2794.319,2807.239,"But you don't have the power to do which this case I guess does ask us to do possibly, and that is also to look at the question of the defense here and say what does it mean in context?"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2826.847,2830.19,"--Well, my opinion is that the statute doesn't say reasonably necessary."
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.812,2833.329,BFOQ.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2835.763,2836.506,Yes.
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.38,2915.368,--Isn't the answer to Justice Breyer's concern about the employer who has an unreasonable criteria that in fact has a bad impact upon older workers?
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2921.584,2922.949,--Yes.
2001.01-584,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.435,2938.386,"Any lawyer advising such, such a, such an employer would say boy, if you are dragged into court, and nobody is going to believe that you didn't adopt this for the reason of getting rid of older employees."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2939.872,2942.268,--It's a much better answer than I gave.
2001.01-584,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.268,2943.587,--It's a very good answer.
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2945.983,2947.319,You gave that answer.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2963.277,2966.25,"Well, I don't think it's a defense."
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.652,2981.853,"Well, even as read in a defense, it's an exclusion category case, the motive."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,2990.77,3011.742,"If we are talking about a disparate treatment case, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that in an appropriate case with an appropriate statistical presentation, a judge would be justified in saying that the plaintiff has presented enough evidence to require the employer to respond to a disparate treatment allegation."
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3061.647,3062.762,May I ask you--
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3062.762,3063.876,--I understand that.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,3088.108,3090.065,I'm not sure I understood the question.
2001.01-584,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.065,3091.619,--Assume your opponent is right.
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,3108.996,3132.236,"Well, I think that would make good sense, but I think that Congress was advised by the secretary of labor that we are going to see correlations between age and neutral selection criteria all the time, and I don't think that Congress had in mind that foreseeable adverse impacts are not done because of but in spite of should be a common basis for a prima facie case, should it be called disparate treatment or disparate impact."
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3132.236,3141.235,May I understand better than I have from your argument why you say it's the reasonable factor is not a defense?
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,3175.953,3179.873,"Well, perhaps our argument was not clear."
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3226.852,3228.049,I thought you were both making arguments?
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,3252.319,3252.858,No.
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3282.784,3284.37,"--Well then, let's just take the two statutes."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,3299.214,3313.249,"Well, I think the answer to that is that the court construed the four so-called affirmative defenses as affirmative defenses under the Equal Pay Act."
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.744,3358.657,"--I don't follow why it isn't, you couldn't make the very same argument about the Equal Pay Act."
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,3358.657,3366.004,"--Well, I suppose if I had been before the court in 1974 arguing that case, I might have made that argument."
2001.01-584,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3366.004,3369.059,"Well, that's another one we are stuck with it because it's stare decisis, isn't it?"
2001.01-584,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,3369.059,3370.091,"Well, no."
2001.01-584,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3374.195,3375.088,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
2001.01-584,2,29590,john_crabtree,,3377.521,3379.174,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2001.01-584,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3497.894,3499.297,"Thank you, Mr. Crabtree."
2001.01-584,2,29590,john_crabtree,,3499.297,3500.494,Thank you very much.
2001.01-584,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3500.494,3501.609,The case is submitted.
