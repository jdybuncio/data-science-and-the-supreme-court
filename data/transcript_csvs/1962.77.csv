1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1415.119,1418.365,We filed no responsive pleading thereto sir.
1962.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1418.365,1421.839,Do you -- are you depending whether it should have been granted?
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1421.839,1425.746,"Well, I'm of this opinion Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1488.402,1488.531,But --
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1488.531,1523.495,"But if we had -- assume for the purposes of argument sir that the motion had been granted and the Board of our -- Virginia Board of Parole had been substituted as a party respondent to the proceedings, then -- and in the meantime now, the man would’ve been released on parole when he was delivered into the custody of the Superintendent of the Virginia State Penit -- of the -- from this custody of the Superintendent of the penitentiary into the custody of the Parole Board in conformity with Section 53-264 of the Code of Virginia."

1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1563.331,1564.585,"No, sir."
1962.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1564.888,1565.658,What --
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1565.658,1565.993,What (Voice Overlap) --

1962.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1583.587,1584.213,Yes.
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1584.213,1599.917,-- must under Virginia law when directed by the Parole Board release any prisoner confined in the penal system to the Parole Board and then the Parole Board releases him.
1962.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1601.57,1613.757,"Are you referring to the order that appears on page 20 where he is released from the custody, but is to remain under supervision until he receives the final order of discharge in the Parole Board?"
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1613.757,1614.659,"Yes, sir."
1962.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1614.983,1616.809,That you call a release from custody?
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1616.809,1617.784,"Yes, sir."
1962.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1617.784,1624.773,"But it does subject him to all of these orders that are in that -- outlined there, does it not?"
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1624.773,1625.92,"Yes sir, it does."
1962.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1625.92,1626.04,And --
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1626.04,1626.227,It -- its --

1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1652.252,1658.504,"I wouldn’t call it conditional, sir in the sense I think that you're using the word."
1962.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1659.945,1660.875,Subject to what?
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1660.875,1667.121,Subject to certain conditions with the hope and idea that he won't come back.
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1751.882,1760.591,"Well, to go right back to such a point that I’m in, wasn’t it that the man was sent to Georgia under the Uniform Act, that’s correct, isn’t it?"
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1760.591,1761.63,"Yes, sir."
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1761.63,1768.94,"Now, looking at the language of the Uniform Act which is cited on page 34 of the brief for the petitioner --"
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1768.94,1769.922,"Yes, sir."
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1769.922,1801.234,"-- the authority of the -- your state under this, the whole section is not quoted, but I presume this is a fair quotation, the authority of your state as I read it is just -- is not confined to a violation, it indicates that your officers may go in and take this man and he has waived the taking as has Georgia as the party to this statute, they have the same statute and you may -- he may be produced apparently from this reading for any purpose."
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1804.941,1813.824,I wouldn’t want to have to try the habeas corpus case in the State of Georgia sir on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia because I think I’d lose.
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1825.515,1842.905,What is the meaning of the language then in the statute that says the decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state?
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1851.691,1858.358,I'm trying to -- that the whole act is printed sir in our appendix and I've been trying to find the section.
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1904.134,1920.176,Isn't the whole the purpose of this statute to permit some flexibility in terms of sending people out and to leave with the committing state the decision as to why they revoked it as though he were within the committing state?
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1947.18,1948.884,"I don’t think so, sir."
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1948.884,1949.309,"In other words, you're saying whether in --"
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1949.309,1950.499,"Oh, I don’t --"
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1950.499,1951.831,-- Virginia or in Georgia it would’ve been the same.
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1951.831,1953.262,It wouldn’t make any difference.
1962.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1954.83,1956.291,We’ll recess now.
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1963.985,1965.7,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1996.643,1999.492,Is there [Inaudible]
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,1999.492,2000.708,"That is correct, sir."
1962.77,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2000.708,2002.913,[Inaudible]
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2002.913,2004.151,That is correct.
1962.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2051.797,2055.87,How about -- he’s not allowed to own or operate a motor vehicle?
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2055.87,2058.007,"Without the permission of his parole officer, sir."
1962.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2070.28,2076.63,And he’s required to permit his parole officer to visit his home or place of employment at any time?
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2076.63,2077.581,"Yes, sir."
1962.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.581,2082.197,If the parole officer wants to presumably come in there are in midnight some night --
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2082.197,2082.949,"That is -- yes, sir."
1962.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2082.949,2083.51,-- to see what he’s doing (Voice Overlap) --
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2083.51,2089.291,But that is not logical nor -- I mean the parole officer is not going to come around midnight looking for him.
1962.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.291,2090.965,"Well, who knows?"
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2090.965,2098.649,The -- we have to take I think a reasonable view of these regulations sir and assume that they are going to be reasonably applied.
1962.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2098.649,2116.43,"Certainly, you wouldn’t -- you wouldn’t quarrel as this state -- the statement that it’s fair to say that this fellow was subject to considerably more control and considerably more restrictions than are placed by society on the average member of society."
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2116.43,2116.734,I'm not sure (Voice Overlap) --
1962.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2116.734,2118.968,"To be sure, we all are suppose to obey them all but the --"
1962.77,1,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,2118.968,2119.557,I understand.
1962.77,2,21248,daniel_j_meador,,3164.26,3165.68,May it please the Court.
1962.77,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3172.031,3172.551,Very well.
1962.77,2,21248,daniel_j_meador,,3172.551,3177.934,"Thank you, sir."
1962.77,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3177.934,3190.892,"Mr. Meador, before you leave, I would like to express the appreciation of the Court for you having accepted this assignment to represent this indigent defendant."
1962.77,3,39440,reno_s_harp_iii,,3207.002,3208.238,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
