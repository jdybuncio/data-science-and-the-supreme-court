1987.87-519,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.737,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-519, Gary Maynard v. William Cartwright."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,13.01,17.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,82.734,107.441,"Ms. Dickerson, have the appellate courts in Oklahoma since this court was decided, specifically I think in the Stouffer case and the Brown case, recently adopted the Tenth Circuit's view of the requirements for narrowing the especially heinous, aggravating circumstance?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,107.441,108.602,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.415,138.753,"Was that decision, those decisions a matter based on both state and federal law, do you think?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,138.753,139.723,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,151.6,156.344,What do those opinions do to your case?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,156.344,175.205,"Justice Blackmun, we would contend that jurisdiction is still appropriate with this Court, and that it is the ultimate decision of this Court to determine, as a matter of federal constitutional law, whether or not a state is limited to a finding of serious physical abuse."
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,175.205,184.681,"In other words, you are taking the position that the Tenth Circuit, and it was unanimous wasn't it?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,184.681,186.013,"Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,186.013,189.494,Misinterpreted our decisions here?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,189.494,192.115,"Yes, Your Honor, it is our contention."
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,192.115,198.14,"You are swimming upstream, aren't you, with an en banc case?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,198.14,206.787,"In Godfrey, there was a dissent which indicated that psychological torture could be used as a measure of determining whether or not that--"
1987.87-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.787,208.237,"That was a dissent, wasn't it?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,208.237,209.319,"--Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.319,212.331,Are you asking us to overrule Godfrey?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,212.331,215.491,"I don't believe it's necessary, Justice O'Connor, to overrule--"
1987.87-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.491,220.997,"Well, it sounds very much, to me, like it would be necessary to reach the result you are asking for."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,223.137,225.158,--The distinctions in Godfrey are that--
1987.87-519,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.158,227.661,Other than by reliance upon the dissenting opinion.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,227.661,245.443,"--In Godfrey, Godfrey was a domestic situation in which the killer had immediately prior to the killing engaged in a heated conversation with this estranged wife, proceeded immediately to the same, shot his wife and killed here, and then proceeded to shoot and kill the mother-in-law."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.74,473.182,"What is so especially atrocious, heinous or cruel?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,474.883,498.397,"Justice Scalia, we would contend that this intent, this laying in wait, this return under cover of darkness, all of the items I've mentioned previously, as well as the cruelty inflicted by virtue of the fact that there were psychological torture experienced by Mr. Riddle, although he died instantly, which would set this murder apart from other murders."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.397,503.062,"Well, I don't see the latter."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,516.66,523.726,I think it is appropriate to put the entire crime scenario in perspective in that the Riddles had been in the living room.
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.816,596.312,Did the instructions here allow the jury to consider the atrociousness or heinousness of the crime as a whole?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,602.857,603.718,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.848,612.893,Do you think that that's constitutionally permissible under our decision; that we can look at the whole crime and not just the murder of Mr. Riddle alone?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,612.893,614.265,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.036,652.67,"Well, that seems to me a much stronger part of your case than whatever happened to Mr. Riddle who was dead quite soon."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,665.037,677.426,"In all fairness, the first shot may have been intended to have been aimed at another part of her body, but there was some evidence that she deflected the gun shot to her leg in the first instance."
1987.87-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.159,732.141,May I ask about Mrs. Riddle?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,738.796,757.566,"I would assume that his ultimate intention were to kill her in that he did return to the bedroom where she had managed to try to find the telephone working, he did slit her throat and stab her in the abdomen rather than assist her upon her plea for help."
1987.87-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.566,776.0,"The question I suppose I am wrestling with, because I have the same concern Justice Scalia does, should one view the attack on Mrs. Riddle as an attempt to torture her and cause her to suffer unnecessary pain before she would die, or was it just that he was kind of bungling the job of trying to kill her?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,789.449,810.042,"Justice Stevens, I think it would be a fair characterization of the evidence that he intended not only that Mrs. Riddle endure some torture, but that Mr. Riddle endure torture as it related to the suffering of Mrs. Riddle as well prior to the time that he did finally do what he thought would in fact kill her."
1987.87-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.042,818.047,"Did the prosecutor's closing argument explain why the State thought this was cruel, unusual and atrocious?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,818.047,832.807,"Not to the extent relied upon on review by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, but there was reference made to the torture, the psychological trauma to which Mr. Riddle had been exposed."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,832.807,833.668,"Which Mr. Riddle had suffered, yes."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,833.668,834.517,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,845.255,849.477,What would your view if... as a matter of the law.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,873.023,888.273,"In that instance, I believe it would in that there would be actual suffering, and the end result, the end circumstance of the crime would be that there would be some suffering endured there such that the jury could rely upon a finding of cruelty."
1987.87-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.273,893.516,"So that you don't focus really on the mental state of the Defendant, but rather, on the pain suffered by the victim."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,899.74,909.266,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think our approach would validate a finding of looking at the killer's attitude as well as the circumstances of the crime."
1987.87-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.266,911.918,"But you don't have to look at it is what I am asking, in your view."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,920.884,923.516,I would think it could focus on both.
1987.87-519,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.516,924.737,Either one would be sufficient.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,924.737,926.077,I wouldn't say that one would be mutually exclusive of the other.
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.34,958.029,"Ms. Dickerson, I would like to come back to Justice Stevens's question about specifically whether the jury was asked to take into account the suffering that the wife endured."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,970.118,974.169,"It was part of the general closing argument made to the jury; yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.937,995.283,"And the whole thing went to the jury together, not just the killing of the husband, but the whole incident, including the wounding of the wife?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,995.283,996.574,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,998.976,1006.511,Could I bring you back to your comment before the last series of questions?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1019.5,1046.828,"I believe, Justice Blackmun, I was trying to indicate that prior to the panel opinion, prior to the en banc opinion the three judge panel opinion involved an opinion by Judge Tacha that the circumstances surrounding the torture and abuse to Mrs. Riddle could appropriately be used to assess--"
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1046.828,1050.05,But wasn't that vacated by the en banc opinion?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1050.05,1051.372,"--Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1051.372,1053.283,"Therefore, what significance is it?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1053.283,1054.875,I has no precedential value.
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1054.875,1057.397,Then I wonder why you mention it.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1057.397,1066.161,I mention it merely in connection of the fact that at least at one time one judge was of the opinion that that information could be used.
1987.87-519,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1066.161,1070.125,But he is the same judge who wrote the en banc opinion.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1070.125,1070.783,"It is, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1070.783,1092.828,"Ms. Dickerson, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, the new standard, as I understand their opinion, is that only where there is evidence that the death of the murder victim was preceded by torture or serious physical abuse."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1098.011,1106.436,The holding of the Tenth Circuit did not explicitly state that would be the only constitutional interpretation.
1987.87-519,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1116.424,1131.484,"I gather all that the Tenth Circuit did really was to say that, as a whole, the past construction of the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague; wasn't that it?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1131.484,1132.963,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1987.87-519,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.963,1137.568,"And the Court of Criminal Appeals agreed that, yes, it was."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1142.49,1143.301,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1145.613,1149.757,"--Yes, tell me, what does that do to your case?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1149.757,1164.436,--I think the issue remains with us in that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals merely responded to and assented to the current status of federal constitutional law as interpreted by the Tenth Circuit.
1987.87-519,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1214.167,1228.827,"But I gather were this case to come before the Court of Criminal Appeals at this time, that standard would say that the death penalty could not be imposed in this case."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1228.827,1236.351,"Justice Brennan, our argument would be that it could be due to the fact that psychological torture took place."
1987.87-519,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1236.351,1246.239,"Ms. Dickerson, as between the Court of Criminal Appeals and the Supreme Court, does the Court of Criminal Appeals have to follow the Supreme Court?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1246.239,1250.793,"When interpreting federal constitutional standards, yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1250.793,1257.806,"I mean, but there is no way to go from the Court of Criminal Appeals to the Supreme Court, is there?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1257.806,1260.397,"Not directly in this case, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1260.397,1263.098,"Well, can it go indirectly?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1263.098,1266.151,I would think in the event that--
1987.87-519,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.151,1275.688,"I am trying to find... if the Court of Criminal Appeals says yes, and the Supreme Court says no, what is it, yes or no?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1275.688,1276.429,--Excuse me.
1987.87-519,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1278.95,1281.242,"No, I am talking about the Oklahoma Supreme Court?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1281.242,1284.453,"--In Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Supreme Court does not construe criminal law."
1987.87-519,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1286.136,1287.446,"It doesn't have any jurisdiction, does it?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1287.446,1288.106,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1288.106,1289.148,That's what I thought.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1319.636,1336.887,"Justice Kennedy, our position would be that they have construed it only as a matter of federal law in that they were directed, as it were, by the Tenth Circuit that their standard which they had previously employed did not comport to federal constitutional standards."
1987.87-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.887,1348.745,"If the Supreme Court of the United States says a statute is vague, and the state reinterprets it, the state is telling us what it means as a matter of state law."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1355.98,1366.387,"Again, our position would be that they were forced to adopt this standard by virtue of their understanding of the Tenth Circuit--"
1987.87-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1366.387,1369.659,"Well, they could have said that they can't save the statute."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1388.622,1397.107,--Under that court's understanding of federal constitutional law.
1987.87-519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.107,1399.809,"Well, we are back to where we started."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1414.289,1415.931,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.375,1438.605,"Did you try to bring up here, did the Attorney General's Office try to bring up here, did somebody try to bring up here the case in which the Oklahoma court made the reinterpretation?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1438.605,1443.667,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that was done in this case."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.667,1444.568,Pardon?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1444.568,1452.553,"The other side petitioned for a writ of certiorari in Stouffer, but our side did not."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.553,1453.214,"Well, why not?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1472.117,1473.267,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.09,1495.901,Did the State win or lose in Stouffer?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1495.901,1503.697,"The State won, because although they invalidated the circumstance, they found that other circumstances existed."
1987.87-519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.697,1507.25,"Well, then it would have been impossible for the State to bring it here, I presume."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1510.582,1514.393,"True, there would not have been an issue which the State could have brought."
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.393,1527.983,"Well, they not only reinterpreted the statute in that case, but they undertook... the appellate court itself took a weighing, didn't it?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1527.983,1529.143,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.143,1530.966,Which it did not do in this case.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1530.966,1532.155,Prior to--
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.155,1534.357,"And until then, it had not been doing that."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1534.357,1535.598,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1546.674,1551.148,"And instead, they ordered a resentencing hearing."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1551.148,1558.382,"Prior to the amendment of the statute, there was no resentencing hearing which was directly validated by statute--"
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.382,1558.953,"Oh, I see."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1558.953,1560.205,--which they would automatically modify.
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.205,1561.464,It would be life then.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1561.464,1562.165,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.165,1563.006,All right.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1563.006,1564.226,But they have changed that.
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.226,1566.228,Now they reweigh it.
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1566.228,1567.008,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.008,1575.773,"And they might... and in a case like this, they might affirm a death sentence even in the face of an invalid circumstance."
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1575.773,1576.694,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1587.941,1602.47,"Ms. Dickerson, getting back to the question I asked you earlier, under the new standard I think you answered me that psychological... what did you say, psychological torture or something?"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1602.47,1603.242,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1603.242,1608.855,"Well, the way this reads is... I'm quoting from it,"
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1622.565,1627.778,"It can, Justice Brennan, and several other states have included psychological torture."
1987.87-519,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1627.778,1629.188,What about your court?
1987.87-519,0,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,1629.188,1631.021,They have never directly construed that.
1987.87-519,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1644.048,1646.409,"Thank you, Ms. Dickerson."
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1648.472,1661.799,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-519,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1793.356,1802.403,"Ms. Welch, has the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals adopted a standard now as a matter of state law?"
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1802.403,1803.902,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1821.484,1834.845,And it's your position that they have made clear under Stouffer and Brown that it would not be relevant to consider what happened to another potential victim in the incident?
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1834.845,1839.887,--The facts in Stouffer are strikingly similar to the facts in Mr. Cartwright's case.
1987.87-519,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.167,1927.485,So it's your position that as a matter of state law in Oklahoma it is not possible to rely on what happened in this case to Mrs. Riddle.
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1927.485,1929.395,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-519,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.395,1942.623,"Well, that would seem to... you would also argue then that that opinion for bad... construing torture to include psychological torture."
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1942.623,1946.777,"No, I don't... we do not content that the Tenth Circuit--"
1987.87-519,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.777,1952.29,"Well, what other kind of torture would it be in that case just because the lady saw somebody else being shot?"
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1952.29,1956.505,"--I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question."
1987.87-519,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.505,1964.848,What was it you said the opinion for bad referring to?
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1964.848,1971.774,The Tenth Circuit does not forbade the consideration--
1987.87-519,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.774,1974.305,"I know, in the state case Justice O'Connor was asking you about."
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1974.305,1987.463,"--The State opinion does not take into consideration the suffering of a surviving victim in determining whether or not the murder was heinous, atrocious or cruel."
1987.87-519,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.463,1988.344,Okay.
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,1999.942,2007.628,The surviving victim was shot three times in the Stouffer case.
1987.87-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.628,2008.186,"No, I'm sorry."
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,2020.965,2021.656,Yes.
1987.87-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.656,2022.177,Right?
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,2034.784,2041.6,They did not address psychological torture in the Stouffer case.
1987.87-519,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.6,2052.355,"What other kind of torture... what kind of torture could they have been referring to then when they felt it necessary to say the surviving, what happened to the surviving victim is irrelevant?"
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,2056.058,2057.109,They didn't say it was irrelevant.
1987.87-519,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.714,2100.728,--So you say that might be taken into account.
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,2116.908,2118.89,You might be able to--
1987.87-519,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.89,2119.679,--prior to his being shot.
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,2119.679,2134.079,"--You might be able to take into account a suffering, suffering of the victim if it falls within a clearly defined standard which focuses the jury on that aspect of the murder."
1987.87-519,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.756,2179.157,"Well, an intruder in a bedroom in a home clearly tortures the wife before he kills her, or before he... he doesn't kill her but he then turns around and kills the husband instantly."
1987.87-519,1,36865,mandy_welch,,2186.093,2194.889,I don't think it could under... I think constitutionally I think it could under a standard that focuses the jury on that aspect of the murder.
1987.87-519,2,41233,susan_s_dickerson,,3487.212,3496.979,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-519,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3676.816,3677.607,"Thank you, Ms. Dickerson."
