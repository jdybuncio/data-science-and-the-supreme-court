1973.72-1264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.611,"We will hear arguments first in 72-1264, Mayor of Philadelphia against Educational Equality League."
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,15.031,20.156,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.825,216.54,Were these groups indicated by name or by category?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,216.54,217.723,"By category, Your Honor."
1973.72-1264,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,259.321,262.036,"Mr. Mattioni, perhaps you’ve covered this."
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,268.867,271.382,"That’s correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1973.72-1264,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1347.492,1351.097,"Mr. Mattioni, let me get this evidence in focus."
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1369.613,1372.066,"I believe there is not, Your Honor."
1973.72-1264,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1396.131,1397.149,"Now, one other question."
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1406.278,1408.248,"I believe there is not, Your Honor."
1973.72-1264,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1408.248,1411.479,And yet you have injunctive relief granted.
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1411.479,1429.843,"Well, the Court of Appeals indicated that an injunction should be entered against the present mayor because Anthony Zecca, the Deputy Mayor to change Tate, is still on the staff of Mayor Rizzo, of course his position on that staff is substantially different."
1973.72-1264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1433.648,1442.932,Is there any indication that the Deputy Mayor who’s held over exercises independent judgment free from the Mayor’s supervision?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1442.932,1449.769,"Absolutely none, Your Honor."
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1614.605,1623.793,What are you going to do about the cases where the Federal Courts have ordered cities to employ a certain number of policemen of a certain race?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1624.927,1627.083,"I have not forgotten them, Mr. Justice Marshall, indeed --"
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1627.083,1629.687,You said there was a long line of cases on one side.
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1632.066,1632.335,Yes.
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1633.56,1639.122,And you do admit that the matter is calmed by the constitution so why try to get too much out of it?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1639.122,1641.307,"Well, except for one thing, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.763,1656.469,You mean that the city--
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1656.469,1657.365,There’s no discretion.
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1657.365,1665.125,You mean that the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia is saying I’m not going to hire a Negro under circumstances and nothing can be done about it?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1665.125,1666.413,"Well of course, factually, they could not appear here."
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1666.413,1666.502,"Well, I mean--"
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1666.502,1667.765,"I’m sorry, Mr. Justice, but--"
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1667.765,1670.027,Why try to go too far?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1670.027,1671.925,"I believe that, nevertheless, it’s necessary--"
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1671.925,1679.833,Why don’t you rely on the fact that you say it wasn’t proved in this case without saying that he’s exempt from being looked into?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1679.833,1682.386,"I think, Mr. Justice, that even if I meant--"
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1682.386,1686.09,Do you say that the Mayor cannot be questioned by a Federal Court?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1686.09,1691.053,"I believe that, in the case of this type, you should not be."
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.609,1702.106,Could you explain the Mayor could announce openly that he is not considering for the Nominating Panel any Negroes.
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1702.106,1704.498,"If he did, he would hardly be reelected in Philadelphia, sir."
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.498,1706.499,"That isn’t what I asked you, is it?"
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1706.499,1707.416,"I know, and I submit--"
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.416,1709.199,"Well, how about that?"
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1712.352,1713.396,"Well, I submit--"
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.396,1717.358,Would the Mayor be subject to any kind of legal redress?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1717.358,1720.136,"I submit that he would not, Mr. Justice, and the reason for that is this."
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.136,1721.952,Does your case depend on that?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1721.952,1722.499,Sir?
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.499,1724.244,Does your case depend on that?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1724.244,1729.337,"No, it does not because I don’t believe that anything like that has been proved."
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.467,1731.725,Let us assume--
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1731.725,1736.67,"If nothing else, sir, what must be kept in mind here is this."
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.762,1743.872,"Well, let’s assume--"
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1743.872,1758.163,"Some consideration of that fact is necessary which requires a Court to at least step back and say “well, before I’m going to get involved in this case, there’s got to be some weighty evidence establishing allegations of actual discrimination.”"
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.163,1770.8,"Well, would you take the same position if the Mayor was appointing the School Board members directly and he announced that he was not considering Negroes for the School Board?"
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1770.8,1773.329,"I believe, I would, Mr. Justice, for this reason."
1973.72-1264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.329,1782.735,And judges and anybody that he had a party of-- in appointing?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1782.735,1785.32,"Yes, Mr. Justice, and the reason for that is simple."
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1805.934,1810.079,Are you aware the fact that this Court has ruled against governors of states?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1810.079,1811.398,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.398,1816.02,"Well, you say the Mayor has got more than the governor has?"
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1816.02,1825.917,"In different context, the Mayor is fully subject to every order of this Court and this Court has full authority, but I’m saying, in this kind of context, this Court should not."
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.917,1827.557,What do you mean this type?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1827.557,1833.682,In this context where we are dealing with a question of executive discretion as opposed to other types.
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.776,1842.7,Do you consider calling out the National Guard in the same category?
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1842.7,1845.003,"It depends on the circumstances, Mr. Justice."
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1845.003,1849.875,"Well, it showed in Constantin this Court didn’t’ have any trouble questioning the government about that."
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1849.875,1855.843,"But again, Mr. Justice, I think it depends on the particular facts in a given case."
1973.72-1264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1855.843,1858.672,And this -- your difference is this is filled up.
1973.72-1264,0,31989,john_mattioni,,1858.672,1865.21,"No, not that, Mr. Justice."
1973.72-1264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1865.21,1867.554,Mr. Wolf.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,1867.554,1871.439,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2004.537,2010.137,You mean the selection of the panel or the function of the panel after it was selected?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2010.137,2012.844,The function of the panel after it was selected.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2018.979,2022.08,Would you say there’s quite a difference in the two?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2022.08,2031.972,"Oh, yes, because, as was pointed out in response to Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question, we are not attacking the action of the panel."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.791,2040.635,"How many Catholics, for example, on this Nominating Panel at the time of this litigation?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2040.635,2042.096,I don’t know exactly.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.098,2059.099,But don’t you think that’s of any importance?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2059.099,2074.533,"Well, I think that in this case we were trying to establish only that there was exclusion from consideration of qualified Blacks to the panel, and I think that that’s an important notion about our case."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2087.397,2091.676,Do you know what proportion of Catholics live in the City of Philadelphia?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2091.676,2094.297,"Yes, I know that there are more Catholics than there are Blacks."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.917,2100.359,"But they have only two members of the panel, did you say?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2100.359,2107.563,There are not very many Black Catholics who are in the public schools because there’s a substantial archdiocese in School District in Philadelphia.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.563,2110.563,"Would that, in turn, make a difference in your mind?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2110.563,2114.695,"No, because, again, we’re not talking about whether everybody is represented."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2122.839,2129.661,You don’t know whether there was any such exclusionary attitude with respect to other minorities.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2129.661,2136.843,"No, we did not inquire into that, and our clients would not have had standing to raise that as a matter-- of course, maybe they would’ve."
1973.72-1264,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2271.038,2271.583,What page is it?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2271.583,2275.89,"Pages 5 to 23 in the Appendix, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2298.132,2299.593,Could you help me a little?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2299.593,2299.784,I’m sorry.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2299.784,2305.961,What does this have to do-- would you relate that to the panel problem that we’re dealing with?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2305.961,2306.603,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2306.603,2309.797,You mean this shows an attitude on the part of the Mayor?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2309.797,2311.62,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.62,2312.681,Or someone?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2312.681,2319.253,I think that the principal issue in this case is how do you prove a case of racial discrimination?
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2448.686,2457.64,Do you think this is the correct standard of review for a Court of Appeals reviewing findings of the District Court?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2457.64,2458.774,"Yes, because the--"
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.774,2468.404,"Well, may the Court of Appeals reverse if they find that a contrary conclusion to that of the District Court is a permissible conclusion?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2468.404,2484.805,"Well, in this context, they can because the issue is not a factual inference to be drawn but a legal inference to be drawn, and the legal inference is, was there sufficient evidence in the record to establish a prima facie case?"
1973.72-1264,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2796.02,2796.202,Do you think--
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2796.202,2798.291,What the evidence says on the record.
1973.72-1264,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2798.291,2807.099,Do you think the Mayor Rizzo ought to have a chance to testify before an injunction is entered against him?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2807.099,2811.497,"Absolutely, and I think the Court of Appeals also made that clear."
1973.72-1264,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2811.497,2814.122,But the injunction was directed to issue against him.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2814.122,2823.516,"Well, I think the Court of Appeals began its discussion of remedy by saying it is for the District Court to determine the precise nature of the relief."
1973.72-1264,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2828.025,2833.013,You say then that without further proceedings an injunction should not issue against Mayor Rizzo.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2833.013,2836.877,"Yes, that would be my position but, on the other hand, I think as--"
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.877,2838.854,"But it isn’t the Court of Appeals’ position, is it?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2838.854,2863.858,"Well, the Courts of Appeals, I think, was speaking to the proposition stated by Mr. Justice White, in most recently in Alexander versus Louisiana, quoting Louisiana versus United States with regard to the obligation of a Federal Court not only to declare racial discrimination when it sees it but also to grant effective relief to see that its effects are eliminated and that it does not recur in the future."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.619,2881.369,"Well, I thought the Court of Appeals rather emphasized the fact that the Deputy Mayor remains the same person?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2881.369,2929.486,"Well, the Court of Appeals said in Footnote 21 in page 49 of the petition for certiorari, which is the point that I was just making, nevertheless, on this record Mr. Zecca continues as a Deputy Mayor and, since this Court finds that plaintiffs have shown on this record discrimination in regard to the present panel, the Federal Courts must assure that the appointment of a 1973 panel is free from taint and I think that in this whole discussion of remedy, which appears really on one paragraph on pages 48 and 49 of the petition, that there is an emphasis on the fact that they’re dealing with a record."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.659,2951.062,"Well, you suggest in any event we read the Court of Appeals opinion as though it did not direct the District Court to issue an injunction, but gives the Mayor?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2951.062,2953.453,I think that’s true.
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.342,2972.148,"And that if the mayor did absolutely nothing after-- on remand, an injunction should not issue until the other side noticed some further proceedings."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2972.148,2975.678,I’m not sure that I-- the Mayor has already appointed the 1973 panel.
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.678,2986.168,"Yes, but the Mayor-- but with respect to whether an injunction should issue against him or not, the burden is not on the Mayor to go in and have some injunction vacated?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,2986.168,2990.19,"No, and that’s one of the problems with this case."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.987,3013.119,"So you-- I taken then, you really-- it sounds to me as though you would really be satisfied if whatever part of this judgment was declaratory is affirmed?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3013.119,3017.613,"Well, I think that I would not read the --"
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.613,3020.944,With respect to the Mayor.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3020.944,3034.526,"I think that the appropriate disposition of this case, as far as I’m concerned, is to remand it to the District Court for further proceedings to determine the precise nature of the relief to which plaintiffs are entitled."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.526,3036.336,Do you think there’s still the case of controversy then?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3036.336,3037.615,"Oh, yes."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.615,3041.368,Between Mayor Rizzo and the plaintiffs?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3041.368,3044.0,"Oh, yes, there is definitely a case in controversy."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3051.964,3052.44,Yes.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3052.44,3058.701,"We initially sought to enjoin any action by the panel, but we were denied that relief and the panel did act."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.302,3087.786,"I suppose that if this suit were brought -- had been brought for the first time now, after a new Mayor had been elected, and all you attack was the activities of Mayor Tate and introduce no more evidence and purport introduced no more evidence than you introduced in this case, you might have some trouble about having a case of controversy?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3087.786,3103.807,"No, because there are people sitting on the School Board as a result of the activities of a 1971 panel and, like in Turner versus Fouche on remand, the remedy is to remove them."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.807,3110.39,"That isn’t what you-- you aren’t suggesting that the School Board members be removed, are you?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3110.39,3137.455,"That is a possible remedy on remand, and the Court of Appeals, again, said in its amendment to the opinion which was filed in February at our request on remand, the District Court-- this is on page 53 of the petition for certiorari, the District Court should consider the continuing effectiveness of appointments to the Board made after August 1971 on the basis of all the facts which may be developed at the hearing on such remand."
1973.72-1264,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.158,3207.534,"Mr. Wolf, supposing that after the 1976 Presidential election, whoever is then President Elect is asked whether he plans to appoint a Catholic to the Cabinet and his response is “no, I don’t."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3230.546,3233.072,"Well, I think that you’re asking two questions there."
1973.72-1264,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3240.357,3240.937,"Well, I give you--"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3240.937,3242.27,-- whether they would succeed.
1973.72-1264,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3242.27,3247.753,"By hypothesis, I give you the fact that the President Elect himself states that they are excluded a priori."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3247.753,3280.959,"Well, I suspect that with regard to a Presidential appointment to the Cabinet that the President would introduce or at least there would be argument regarding the confidential personal nature of the relationship between the President and a Cabinet member regarding the political nature of the appointment, that is, that the appointee is to carryout the President’s policy, and that becomes relevant as a matter of rebutting the prima facie case."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.035,3331.04,Well is this different-- would it be different if the Mayor of Philadelphia announced that he just wasn’t considering any members of a particular political party for a position on the School Board?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3331.04,3338.305,"No, I don’t think that the Equal Protection Clause protects members of a political party as opposed to another."
1973.72-1264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.692,3352.565,"Well, it talks about equal protection, but you should -- you may discriminate against somebody, the Mayor may discriminate against somebody on the grounds of his political beliefs?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3352.565,3358.468,"I think that’s right, but I don’t really think that that was what was intended to be covered by the Fourteenth Amendment."
1973.72-1264,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3358.468,3362.496,"And that gets not only in the equal protection area, but the first Amendment area."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3362.852,3364.076,That’s right.
1973.72-1264,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.076,3373.763,"Justice White’s question, and yet you arguendo at least concede the validity of that sort of discrimination, do you?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3373.763,3377.61,"Well I think that, first of all, it’s really not involved in this case."
1973.72-1264,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3377.759,3378.728,"Well, it may be."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3382.043,3393.74,"I think that the Equal Protection Clause would apply and I think, again, in that situation what you have is an overwhelming defense, overwhelming explanation."
1973.72-1264,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3403.398,3409.616,And what if the political party were the Lily White Party?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3409.616,3416.629,"Well, I think that you begin to get into Mr. Justice Powell’s word of pre-textual."
1973.72-1264,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3416.629,3420.27,"No, he went open and nothing pre-texual, the only thing undercover about it--"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3420.27,3421.245,"No, what I mean is that you--"
1973.72-1264,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3421.245,3423.592,The political party would be an all-White party.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3423.592,3439.662,"What I mean is that you begin to get to the question of whether saying that he is not going to appoint any members of that political party is a pre-text for not appointing any Blacks and if you find that it’s a pre-text, then I think that it is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3439.662,3474.565,"Well, to pursue that line for a moment even though it may take us quite far, suppose the Mayor having-- a Mayor, having been elected, has an analysis made of the precincts and wards from which his support came and he announced that since he only had 10% support in the Negro-voting districts of the city he was going to appoint only 10% Negros, not exceeding 10% of the panel, the Nominating Panel."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3476.427,3477.865,That’s right.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3487.901,3488.106,How do you distinguish it--
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3488.106,3490.556,From consideration of members of a particular race.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3490.556,3496.971,How do you distinguish it from the response you gave to Mr. Justice Stewart?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3511.368,3513.461,"Well, I think that’s a tough case."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3518.307,3526.113,But does it not suggest something about the difficulty of having judges make these philosophical analysis?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3526.113,3554.583,"Oh, it is no question that the-- that determining whether a case has been made out is always a difficult one and the thing that you have to look at is-- under the law, is first of all, whether the plaintiffs have presented evidence which, if unrebutted, would establish a case of discrimination and, second, whether the defendant has brought forth evidence in mitigation."
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3606.035,3614.884,"Mr. Wolf, what worries me is, up until just a few minutes ago, I understood you were not after the School Board members at all."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3614.884,3615.758,That’s right.
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3615.758,3616.703,"And now, you are."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3616.703,3619.348,"No, I’m only after the panel members."
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3620.515,3625.6,I thought you said when you went back to the lower Court.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3625.6,3630.289,"Oh, that’s as a matter of relief, Mr. Justice Marshall, only a question of what relief --"
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3630.289,3633.435,Isn’t that matter before us?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3633.435,3636.474,"Well, I don’t think so because the question of relief is always a matter--"
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3636.474,3638.287,"Well, you want us to move blindly on this?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3638.287,3639.006,Excuse me?
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3639.006,3641.366,was just to ignore what you said?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3641.366,3646.641,"No, I think the case should be sent back because--"
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3646.641,3649.484,So that you can attack the School Board members.
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3649.484,3652.331,"No, because there’s no relief that’s been entered here."
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3654.58,3666.033,"I understand that, but I understood you to say that when you went back, you more than likely would ask that those people that were put on in 1971 be removed."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3666.033,3680.162,"That’s right and the reason is because the process by which they were appointed violated the constitution and if the process violates the constitution, then under Louisiana versus--"
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3680.162,3684.314,"Then I have to ignore what you said that they aren’t involved, they are?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3684.314,3691.259,"Well, there-- when I said they were not involved, what I said was there is no attack on the racial composition of the School Board."
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3692.337,3694.225,Why do you want them taken off?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3694.225,3700.866,"Because the procedure, the process, whereby they were appointed was constitutionally invalid."
1973.72-1264,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3700.866,3704.181,"Even if there were Negroes, they have to go?"
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3704.181,3707.912,Even if there were Negroes because the process was unconstitutional.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3727.374,3734.709,"Mr. Wolf, let me ask you one final question that you may or may not be in position to respond to."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3762.295,3764.142,I don’t think they were finding a fact.
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3771.556,3776.126,Do you think they were just using this term inadvertently and artfully?
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3776.126,3782.781,"Yes, because you also find conclusions of law, I think, or make-- I guess you make conclusions upon as opposed to findings of fact."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3782.781,3787.489,"Well, when judges use those terms, I think they use them more carefully normally."
1973.72-1264,1,23426,edwin_d_wolf,,3787.489,3803.748,"Well, I think though that the question of whether a particular set of evidence makes out a case of racial discrimination is a conclusion of law, and that kind of conclusion of law is appropriate for a Court of Appeals to draw."
1973.72-1264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3803.876,3804.73,"Very well, Mr. Wolf."
