2002.01-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.098,"We'll hear argument next in No. 01-896, the Ford Motor Company and Citibank v. John B. McCauley."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,60.817,63.675,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.9,163.487,"What's sort of unusual, though, is that you didn't suffer the dismissal."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,175.603,176.709,--That is--
2002.01-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,176.709,180.48,--not... not the person who benefitted by the dismissal and that--
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,180.48,189.489,"--Indeed, and that, Justice Scalia, is the... is the question I believe, the specific question, that the Court directed the parties' attention to in its request for supplemental briefs."
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.597,231.352,--Mr. Waxman.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,231.352,232.132,--and in Forney v. Apfel.
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,232.132,243.576,"Mr. Waxman, a defendant who removes a case and then is remanded is surely aggrieved but, nonetheless, cannot appeal."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,317.926,332.128,"Justice Ginsburg, the appealability of the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated complaint does not depend on whether the consolidated complaint, quote, did away with the other actions."
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,439.286,440.846,"Mr. Waxman, may I stop you at that point?"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,469.5,469.812,"--No, no, no."
2002.01-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.608,534.661,But ordinarily you wouldn't go... go about it that way.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,539.197,550.312,"That... that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, although there are instances where the court... where the transferee court has ordered the filing of something called a consolidated complaint."
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,590.956,601.714,"Mr. Waxman, things like that, juris... basic jurisdictional thing, agreeing... this would be a consent to have a court that has no authority to adjudicate a case to adjudicate it."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,651.905,660.857,"Justice Ginsburg, it certainly could have been, and if it were ordered by the court, that is the most that it could have been."
2002.01-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.311,679.608,"Mr. Waxman, can I interrupt you with a question?"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,703.24,716.397,"--That... I think your premise... the premise of your question, Justice Stevens, with respect, is incorrect, which is if we had asked for a dismissal on subject matter jurisdiction grounds and prevailed... that is, we would have--"
2002.01-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.438,716.397,No.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,721.471,725.767,"--If we had asked for it, then we would have gotten all that we could possibly have expected."
2002.01-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.651,750.257,Why did the district court say it had no subject matter?
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,752.055,753.616,"--Yes, because of the amount in controversy."
2002.01-896,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,763.554,764.351,Or you have a brand new--
2002.01-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.351,770.144,"--You would not have been aggrieved... if... if that was the only case pending and so... and if it was dismissed, how would you have been aggrieved?"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,770.144,787.467,"--We would have been aggrieved in the same way... because what we sought was... what we wanted was litigation in a single forum, in a forum which had already conducted substantial pretrial proceedings and a Federal forum."
2002.01-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.662,825.469,"Do you... do you argue that in just an ordinary case if a... you file... a defendant files a motion to dismiss both on the grounds of no cause of action and so forth and so on and also no jurisdiction, you win on no jurisdiction, you can appeal that?"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,825.469,830.611,"--Well, I think, this Court's decision in Forney v. Apfel stands for that proposition."
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.32,884.412,"Mr. Waxman, I think the problem is those six State court actions that haven't vanished."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,923.869,928.865,"--Not... with respect, Justice Ginsburg, maybe I... perhaps I'm not understanding you."
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.626,946.545,Let... let me ask you about one solution to the epistemological question.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,960.274,961.351,--You mean--
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,961.351,962.693,You're not going to do that.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,974.059,974.986,--Well--
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,974.986,992.956,"And... and that it seems to me, unless I am missing the point of what you are necessarily going to do, it follows that... that the... that the Federal case is, in fact, simply the alter ego of the State cases, and if you win here, you are functionally doing nothing but eliminating subsection (d)."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,992.956,1006.28,"--I... with respect, Justice Souter, if... there are plaintiffs in two of the State cases who are not even named plaintiffs in the Federal case."
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1009.996,1010.914,Are they within the class?
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1010.914,1015.48,"Well, the... all of the cases seek a nationwide class."
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1015.48,1021.322,"Sure, and don't you think those non-named plaintiffs would be happy to let somebody else carry the ball for them in... in the Federal action?"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1021.322,1022.113,Well--
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1022.113,1028.545,"They're... they're not going to fight you when you say to the State courts, just let them sit here until we get the Federal case taken care of."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1028.545,1030.492,--There are... I'll go to door number two.
2002.01-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.656,1068.55,The consolidated complaint?
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1068.55,1069.212,--Yes.
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1069.212,1096.192,"No, but I mean, you... but our point is if functionally you are going to treat this as the alt... the equivalent, the alternative to all of these State actions... and you have told me nothing to suggest that you're not going to do that... then it seems to me that the... the... the argument has got to prevail that functionally this in... in fact is nothing but an end run around the non-appealability of the remand."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1096.192,1119.34,"Well, in point of fact, Justice Souter, if this Court reverses the Ninth Circuit for the... for... for one of the two errors of law that it committed, and on remand, the conclusion is made that there is subject matter jurisdiction and the case can proceed, we will be in precisely the same posture that we were in at the time that the plaintiffs filed the consolidated complaint."
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1119.34,1123.487,"No, because at that time the... the... the State cases had been remanded."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1123.487,1127.909,"And... well, the State cases have not yet been remanded, but if the State--"
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1127.909,1128.312,I... I mean... I'm sorry.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1130.501,1130.712,--They had been removed.
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.712,1130.988,They had been removed.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1130.988,1137.911,And they will remain removed if this... if a Federal court concludes that there is subject matter jurisdiction.
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1137.911,1146.444,I thought that the order of the Western District of Washington was that the State cases are remanded.
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1146.444,1147.306,That's what I thought.
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1147.306,1153.349,"And that the Ninth Circuit did not touch that, that the Ninth Circuit dealt only with the consolidated complaint."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1153.349,1157.69,There is a single order in the case that says there is no jurisdiction.
2002.01-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1187.273,1190.817,"Well, but stayed by the Ninth Circuit prior to argument there?"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1190.817,1191.363,--No.
2002.01-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.12,1197.997,"Well, didn't that stay expire with the decision of the court of appeals?"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1197.997,1202.263,--It would have except that we moved for a stay of the mandate.
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1218.321,1232.1,"But I still think... I still think you're in trouble because even if we accept your... your reading of what the... the court ordered and what it's likely to do if you prevail here, it simply changes the characterization of what's going on."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1253.383,1256.045,"--Not true, Justice Souter, for two reasons."
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.132,1316.142,"Mr. Waxman, give me an example of any case in which a defendant in a product liability suit, in a credit suit like this one, a defendant has said I want to preempt the class action and so I am going to bring this declaratory suit against all the credit card holders of this plan all over America in the forum that I choose, and that's going to be where the class action is going to proceed."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1339.879,1343.815,"--I... as I'm standing here, Justice Ginsburg, I... I can't bring any cases to mind."
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1355.811,1356.604,Because you have--
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1356.604,1357.967,--and we want a declaration that--
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.967,1363.576,"--Because, Mr. Waxman, you have potential plaintiffs from all over the country."
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1400.685,1417.716,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we were to have filed such a case... and my submission is it would be the functional equivalent of a consolidated complaint... it would not disempower plaintiffs or plaintiffs' representatives from filing their own class actions in State or Federal court."
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1426.808,1427.953,"Well, in any case you said it--"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1427.953,1428.29,--as to whether it makes sense--
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.29,1431.229,"--It doesn't occur to you that there is such a case, but--"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1431.229,1434.391,--I am... I am sure that there are many such cases.
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1436.697,1443.315,--Where defendant starts the action as a declaratory action and a class gets certified on the plaintiff's side.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1443.315,1444.416,That's correct.
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1496.0,1498.141,Will it go forward without your objection?
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1503.269,1506.552,Under this... yes.
2002.01-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1541.089,1544.509,"How many... how many... I'm sorry, but how many other cases like the Alabama case are there?"
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1547.403,1553.226,--I... I don't know that I have the... all of the details of the underlying cases in mind.
2002.01-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1573.323,1575.351,They all ask for compensation.
2002.01-896,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1585.314,1610.512,"Well, it's... it is clear, Justice Ginsburg... and if it isn't clear from the complaint, it is utterly clear from the... from the plaintiffs' red brief in this case at page 45 that what they... the object of this litigation is reinstatement of the national Ford credit rebate program under which they can earn credits toward the purchase of a Ford vehicle."
2002.01-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.415,1676.773,"Very well, Mr. Waxman."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1678.505,1686.631,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.081,1743.705,"I... it was your clients, Mr. Berman, who filed the consolidated complaint in the Western District, I take it."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1743.705,1744.381,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.381,1747.88,And who was it that moved to dismiss that complaint?
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1747.88,1750.033,No one moved to dismiss that complaint.
2002.01-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1766.587,1772.663,"And did he... on the subject matter ground that there's not... not $75,000 in controversy?"
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1772.663,1773.899,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.899,1774.57,Thank you.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1774.57,1782.005,And then we briefed that issue and the judge dismissed the case in response to the briefing on the order to show cause.
2002.01-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1782.005,1784.167,And that was before there was any certification.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1787.273,1789.17,"Justice Ginsburg, that was... the answer is yes."
2002.01-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1804.734,1814.896,"Now, as I understand Mr. Waxman's position, it is that the consolidated complaint is a new Federal action."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1866.673,1873.311,"I think you are understanding his argument correctly, but I submit that he's incorrect."
2002.01-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1883.497,1886.949,"Well, who filed the... the consolidated complaint?"
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1888.905,1891.004,"I did, Your Honor, and if you read Judge--"
2002.01-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.004,1897.761,And it had different parties and different complaints than... than the separate State actions.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1897.761,1898.762,--That's correct.
2002.01-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.762,1902.817,Why did you file that consolidated complaint in that fashion?
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1912.632,1922.845,It is not uncommon in MDL practice for pretrial purposes to try to organize the pleadings for the district judge in a consolidated complaint.
2002.01-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.215,1928.884,But didn't it do more than just organize the pleadings?
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1934.554,1955.125,"--Well, there were some representative changes because after all the lawyers across the country got together for the first time, because we were thrown together, some of those lawyers said, if you're going to move for class certification of a nationwide class in one of these State court cases, maybe my representative doesn't need to be there because there's five other representatives."
2002.01-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1968.437,1971.654,It's not a question of abandonment.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,1982.606,1994.171,"Well, there's a Federal case for pretrial purposes, and the judge, Judge Dwyer of the lower court, found he had no jurisdiction anymore over that case which is proceeding in Federal court."
2002.01-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2006.337,2012.109,"Mr. Berman, Mr. Waxman points out that you have submitted an entire complaint."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2041.47,2053.489,"Well, to answer that, Justice Ginsburg, the pretrial order that Mr. Waxman cited to and I think that you cited to as well said that the consolidated complaint was to be filed for pretrial purposes only."
2002.01-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.893,2076.813,Where does it say that?
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2078.688,2079.815,--It's in the--
2002.01-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.815,2091.745,"I mean, the judge says on page 41, should plaintiffs in all or some actions decide to file a consolidated complaint, that complaint shall be filed within 15 days."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2096.176,2100.074,"--No, it does not, Your Honor, and the judge didn't mandate that we do it."
2002.01-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.023,2110.439,"But in Lexecon, we said that the judge who... to whom it was referred for pretrial... couldn't try the case unless both parties consented, didn't we?"
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2110.439,2111.275,"Yes, you did."
2002.01-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.728,2127.015,Could... could you come back to my question?
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2134.457,2138.394,I base that on my understanding of MDL practice.
2002.01-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.808,2146.844,You filed a complaint.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2148.68,2158.914,"In MDL practice, I submit, Justice Scalia, that you do file a complaint of some form that brings all these plaintiffs from all over the country together."
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2177.141,2184.704,"--That's true, but does it normally... is it normally just look like an ord... your complaint looks like an ordinary complaint."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2214.54,2215.93,I think it is very typical--
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.93,2216.936,How do I verify that?
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2216.936,2219.128,--I could submit my supplemental record--
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.128,2219.855,"No, no."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2250.215,2252.303,--It never got there because--
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.303,2252.778,Why?
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2252.778,2258.444,"--that... the order of remand, both by the district judge and the Ninth Circuit, was stayed."
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.444,2267.607,"No, but was the order of remand the... an order to send it back not to the States but to the Federal transferor districts?"
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2267.607,2273.558,Actually I think the language of the order is that the cases are remanded back to the State courts.
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.558,2274.83,To the State courts.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2274.83,2275.012,Yes.
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.012,2276.61,"That must be wrong, mustn't it?"
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2276.61,2277.272,That's correct.
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.272,2279.481,It should go to the transferor districts.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2279.481,2280.013,That's correct.
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.013,2288.794,"And there also... it says specifically and that is pursuant to the MDL order, which we can review, can we not?"
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2288.794,2289.415,"Yes, you can."
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.415,2290.057,Okay.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2302.889,2308.157,If you... if you took jurisdiction under that scenario--
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.157,2308.755,Yes.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2308.755,2313.405,"--in all due respect, you would be violating both the spirit and the intent--"
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.405,2313.9,Not at all.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2314.754,2315.407,--of 1407.
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.407,2315.863,--Not at all.
2002.01-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.487,2346.8,"--Mr. Berman, you don't want us to review an order that never existed, do you?"
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2346.8,2348.667,I'm not sure--
2002.01-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.667,2352.051,You wouldn't want us to... to review an order that should have issued but didn't issue.
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2355.768,2356.73,"No, it did issue."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2356.73,2360.953,--There was... there was an erroneous order of the district court.
2002.01-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.819,2366.245,I think we can review... the... the erroneous order is nonreviewable.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2366.245,2366.949,--That's correct.
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.949,2367.72,No.
2002.01-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.256,2375.735,It says remand to the State--
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.735,2376.803,--To the State courts.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2378.457,2380.545,That is... that is not what he meant.
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.545,2381.34,All right.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2387.067,2396.663,"And the problem I have, Justice Breyer, is that I would like to agree with your argument because, as you pointed out, this is something that's plaguing the courts."
2002.01-896,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2396.663,2396.971,All right.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2416.428,2430.091,"Well, I would like the Court to review the underlying merits, but to do so, I think you have to do some gamesmanship and do injustice to 1407."
2002.01-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2430.091,2431.028,"Isn't, Mr. Berman, what--"
2002.01-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2431.028,2436.795,--Justice Breyer told you that... said that it would have to go back to the State courts.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2446.776,2447.762,That was disposed of.
2002.01-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.762,2462.779,"But that's the only thing we're arguing about here, and the arg... and the contention is it was improperly disposed of and that it was disposed of on a basis that injures the defendants and that they can appeal that because they're aggrieved under the cases that Mr. Waxman cites."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2464.227,2473.969,"And I understand that, Justice Kennedy, but the case that Mr. Waxman cites and the cases he cites for the proposition that an aggrieved party can appeal, I don't quarrel with that."
2002.01-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2488.815,2493.913,"Mr. Berman, I think something needs clarification here."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2533.148,2535.385,--I... I agree with that.
2002.01-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2548.585,2548.949,Okay.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2568.757,2569.498,--That's correct.
2002.01-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2569.498,2570.278,"Yeah, okay."
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2570.278,2571.689,And... and because of that--
2002.01-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2571.689,2572.531,May... may I ask?
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2600.836,2601.303,--No.
2002.01-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.303,2603.324,So that just surfaced today.
2002.01-896,1,40974,steve_w_berman,,2603.324,2605.529,It just surfaced today.
2002.01-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2624.795,2625.511,Us too.
2002.01-896,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3375.274,3376.459,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.01-896,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3496.663,3499.553,They don't... they don't need that for their relief.
2002.01-896,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3507.715,3519.702,"--It's... it would not if... the Court may or may not grant specific performance of the national program in response to a particular plaintiff, but it would certainly not be a frivolous claim."
2002.01-896,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3521.926,3529.672,"Why... Mr.... Mr. Waxman, if you... if the test is one plaintiff... if it's Judge Posner's test, you assume there's one plaintiff, what will it cost the defendant."
2002.01-896,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3539.901,3552.885,"Justice Ginsburg, first, the cost is... the test is the cost of supplying the relief requested in the complaint to any one plaintiff, and that is class-wide relief."
2002.01-896,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3558.16,3559.151,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2002.01-896,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3559.151,3559.319,Thank you.
2002.01-896,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3559.319,3560.453,The case is submitted.
