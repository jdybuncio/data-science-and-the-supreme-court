1972.71-863,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,94.515,"-- hear your argument next in 71-863, Columbia Broadcasting against the Democratic Committee and 864, 865 and 866."
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,104.824,108.4,May it please the Court.
1972.71-863,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.534,848.634,Are these taking the form of hearings --
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,848.634,849.034,"Yes sir, I understand sir."
1972.71-863,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,849.034,850.579,-- in the -- in the rule making tradition?
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,850.579,859.314,Both -- both hearings and written submissions.
1972.71-863,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,925.471,925.987,Would you suggest --
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,925.987,927.512,-- of the First Amendment.
1972.71-863,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,927.512,953.964,"Would you suggest, Mr. Solicitor General that if the Federal Communications Commission had this obligation that's being sought that it would mean that the Commission would also have to step in and put some limits on the amount of advertising, time which could be used and at what hours?"
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,953.964,955.319,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.85,1145.609,"The First -- the First Amendment isn't applicable at all, is it?"
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1153.056,1153.538,"Well, certainly that's --"
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1153.538,1154.252,Unless I'm missing something.
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1154.252,1158.75,"-- true Mr. Justice, literally."
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1166.35,1167.035,"Well, that's right."
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1176.937,1177.136,I think the --
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.136,1179.089,-- that's exactly the opposite side of the coin.
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1179.089,1188.194,I think Mr. Justice that you get into an argument about the First Amendment when you begin to talk about First Amendment values.
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1228.867,1236.493,"Well, maybe somebody else is, but until or unless you can show that it's Government that's doing it, the First Amendment isn't involved, is it?"
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1236.493,1245.121,Unless the Government is under some sort of a -- a duty to help them to protect their First Amendment value.
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1246.461,1252.078,"In other words when a newspaper, turns down an ad and says, “We're not going to run this ad.”"
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1263.714,1298.805,"Well, I would have supposed that was true Mr. Justice, but Congress on February 7, passed a statute giving access to political candidates to the radio, and television, and included in it to the extent that any person sells space in any newspaper or magazine to a legally qualified candidate for federal elective office then they must sell space to other candidates."
1972.71-863,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.805,1300.069,Well the constitutionality that (Voice Overlap) --
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1300.069,1305.275,That is not -- that is not here but I -- I -- that's one reason I'm a little hesitant --
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.275,1305.455,Right.
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1305.52,1306.451,-- about making what I think --
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1306.451,1306.601,I see your position --
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1306.601,1309.781,-- I would otherwise have made as my answer.
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1317.817,1335.038,"Well in any event, it might getting -- whether or not that's been understood you would agree, I -- I would suppose unless I'm all off on the wrong track here that the First Amendment is inapplicable unless and until you can equate broadcasters with Government, state or federal."
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1349.049,1354.108,"Well, I -- I would be happy to accept that view."
1972.71-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.883,1584.859,"Mr. Solicitor General, do you understand that broadcaster's position to rest considerably on the existence of the Fairness Doctrine?"
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1590.961,1592.864,I think their position might be different.
1972.71-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.949,1620.43,"Well, I'll put it the -- I'll put it this way then."
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1638.34,1639.163,"No, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.264,1664.503,The Commission's position isn't then at the -- if -- if the Committee's position were upheld that the Fairness Doctrine would be much more difficult to afford.
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1664.503,1666.879,"What it is, I think it is to a very considerable extent."
1972.71-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.879,1667.466,"Well, that's --"
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1667.466,1676.453,"I think the -- I think that as Commissioner Johnson said in his dissenting opinion, I think it pretty much involves the abolition of the Fairness Doctrine."
1972.71-863,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.453,1681.895,So that -- so that the existence of the Fairness Doctrine is a -- is a very substantial part of the Commission?
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1681.895,1685.862,It is certainly a very large element in the overall picture.
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1715.986,1718.303,"Well, in that extent it was a constitutional case because the plaintiff was (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1718.303,1719.248,And as far as --
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1719.248,1721.163,(Voice overlap) -- didn't have the power to do it.
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1721.163,1725.311,As far as the Constitution was involved that there was nothing in the First Amendment --
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1725.311,1725.919,Right.
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1725.919,1728.105,-- which made the Fairness Doctrine invalid.
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1728.105,1728.348,Right.
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1728.348,1732.756,That seems to me it was a -- it was a --
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.756,1735.877,That while it was a limitation upon the right of the broadcasters it did not --
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1735.877,1735.981,Whether --
1972.71-863,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1735.981,1737.07,-- violate their First Amendment rights.
1972.71-863,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1737.07,1744.803,-- whether Congress was prevented from treating this as an administrative doctrine because of the First Amendment.
1972.71-863,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1927.102,1937.816,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,1943.112,1950.68,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-863,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2046.367,2056.581,"Does the failure of a licensee to observe the Fairness Doctrine, give a balance (inaudible) sometimes become an issue and they come up for a renewal of the license?"
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2056.581,2066.406,"It has indeed, and the Commission's refusal to renew a license on that ground was recently sustained by the -- by the Court of Appeals."
1972.71-863,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2075.522,2083.188,And you're suggesting that's a sufficient control over balancing as against unbalanced programs?
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2083.188,2086.304,I am suggesting that there is no evidence.
1972.71-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.741,2346.695,Weren't their frequencies still not (Inaudible)
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2346.695,2348.345,There are in some places in the country.
1972.71-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.812,2374.756,"Would you thing that predicate is generally -- still true and have to warrant the Commission, regulation might --"
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2374.756,2380.64,"Oh, Mr. Justice White, I'm -- I'm assuming for the -- you mean in the Fairness Doctrine?"
1972.71-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.448,2391.742,"I know, but --"
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2391.742,2393.13,-- that there is state action.
1972.71-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.13,2402.482,-- you're still asserting here that there is a limited -- limited capacity in the television medium.
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2402.482,2420.269,"Well, I'm -- I'm asserting that -- that an individual radio or television station has a limited amount of time and responsible choice has to be made as to what is going to be covering in that time."
1972.71-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.269,2426.823,"You're also -- you're also assuming that there is a limited spectrum of frequencies to be licensed by the Federal Government, I presume --"
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2426.823,2426.96,That is correct.
1972.71-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.96,2434.439,"-- that's in the -- that's been the rationale since 1927 in the Radio Act and that's been the rationale of every decision on the subject in this Court, isn't it?"
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2434.439,2443.094,That is correct and that's -- that's precisely why the Act has placed the responsibility on the individual broadcaster as a trustee.
1972.71-863,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.094,2443.497,Right.
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2443.497,2447.456,"And that -- that term has been -- has been repeated, and repeated."
1972.71-863,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2459.649,2474.628,"I understood Mr. Justice White's question going to unclaimed the potential stations, no other any or very many unclaimed in large market areas?"
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2474.628,2489.415,"They're not very many in large market areas, Mr. Chief Justice.And I take it that the -- that the holding of the court below and that the position of the respondents in this case would not vary from city to city or state to state."
1972.71-863,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2717.56,2723.343,Because of the Cullman rule?
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2723.343,2730.828,Not -- that is because of the necessity of the Fairness Doctrine itself.
1972.71-863,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.828,2731.051,And the common rule exacerbates --
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2731.051,2733.657,"It would be -- exactly, exactly."
1972.71-863,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2743.126,2745.035,Right.
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2745.035,2753.265,"Moreover, increasing involvement of the Government cannot be avoided if editorial advertising is made compulsive."
1972.71-863,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2761.495,2764.012,"I think your time is up, Mr. Jennes."
1972.71-863,1,22563,ernest_w_jennes,,2764.012,2772.615,Let me conclude by saying that the threat of intimate direct and pervasive government regulation to broadcast content -- of content would be serious.
1972.71-863,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2784.576,2786.643,Mr. Wollenberg.
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,2786.643,2790.22,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-863,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2894.679,2900.291,You don't then content that your -- your client's constitutional rights were violated by the decision below.
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,2900.291,2900.544,No.
1972.71-863,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2909.049,2916.56,"That -- that contention if -- that contention would be similar to the contention that was made by the broadcasters in Red Lion, and it's not made here."
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,2916.56,2926.078,And let me say Your Honor that I associate myself with Mr. Jennes' statement that we are -- we accept Red Lion --
1972.71-863,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2926.078,2926.673,Right.
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,2926.673,2947.176,"-- that were not here undercutting Red Lion and that to the contrary, we suggest that the trustee fairness scheme created by Congress and the Commission and upheld in Red Lion would be diminished, hampered and frustrated by the holding of the court below."
1972.71-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.176,2964.152,"Well, Mr. Wollenberg I take from the -- the responses of the broadcasters that they relied on the Fairness Doctrine to some extent at least as a justification for the refusal of -- of selling advertisements."
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,2964.152,2983.188,"I don't know Your Honor whether I would use the word “justification” but I would say this, that the broadcasters having been told very clearly in the pronouncements of the Commission and the pronouncements of this Court in Red Lion, that they have a responsibility to achieve fairness."
1972.71-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.878,3103.897,"Well, Mr. Wollenberg, what -- what is your -- what is your view?"
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3112.579,3116.624,It is our position which I hope to get into --
1972.71-863,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.624,3117.064,"Well, I didn't mean --"
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3117.064,3140.492,"-- a little greater length after the lunch and recess, but it is our position that there is not state action here and that their not being state action that -- that is an alternative ground for reversal of the judgment below because the First Amendment question does not arise unless there is state action."
1972.71-863,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3198.448,3201.971,Mr. Wollenberg during lunch maybe you can tend to the answer this question.
1972.71-863,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3222.416,3230.11,I think we'll let you respond to that right after we lunch.
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3233.057,3245.508,Before attempting a response to the open book examination question that was left with me at the recess and completing my -- my discussion with state action.
1972.71-863,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3494.844,3506.295,"Mr. Wollenberg, don't you at least have this difference between Lloyd and Moose Lodge on the one hand, and the situation of the broadcaster on the other that the -- the license which he holds is really a -- a form of profit."
1972.71-863,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3520.243,3529.033,"Well, of course, in Moose Lodge at least one dissent argued that the number of liquor licenses were limited in -- in the State."
1972.71-863,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3857.018,3858.814,"Thank you, Mr. Wollenberg."
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,3868.485,3874.418,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-863,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3984.965,3991.574,Mr. Califano would you care to define responsible entity?
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,3991.574,4011.596,Your Honor we'll use that -- Mr. Justice we used that phrase in the rule because it is the phrase used to -- by the communications industry in the FCC under the Fairness Doctrine and -- where they present an editorial view on one side and say that responsible spokesman are invited to answer that editorial on the other side.
1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4011.596,4017.136,"Certainly not a concept though that has any relevance to the First Amendment, is it?"
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4017.136,4017.75,I think the relevance --
1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4017.75,4024.45,"The First Amendment doesn't allow the Government to control the speech of their responsible people, does it?"
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4024.45,4026.157,"No your -- No, Mr. Justice."
1972.71-863,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4057.471,4088.694,"Mr. Califano, while we have you stopped -- would it be reasonable and appropriate for the Federal Communications Commission under your formulation to say yes the network or the station must make that time available on those terms provided that they make an equal amount of time available within the same five-minute span for the contrary view?"
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4098.341,4110.917,"Well, the -- Mr. Chief Justice, we have -- the Fairness Doctrine would still operate as we see our rule."
1972.71-863,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4159.075,4171.932,"Well, wouldn't this -- wouldn't this hypothetical situation I have just suggested be an implementation in a precise way of what the Fairness doctrine is driving at?"
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4171.932,4176.625,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, that -- that is certainly one way to do it."
1972.71-863,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4184.502,4187.585,"Well, on the fairness question lies, would this be a reasonable solution?"
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4187.585,4192.517,Yes Your Honor.

1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4336.946,4337.884,They say that --

1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4361.927,4362.752,Just answer that question.

1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4377.885,4400.581,"Well, certainly they are different but I just want to be sure I -- that you go at least that far under the First Amendment that if -- that if these were ordinary, that if these were newspapers, they would have an absolute right to print want they wanted and to refuse to print what anybody wanted them to, government or private individual, wouldn't that be true?"
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4400.581,4401.748,That's correct.

1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4406.9,4409.367,All right.
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4409.367,4435.87,"The Communications Act, I might note on -- on that point specifically -- specifically notes in Section 301 that the FCC which grants licenses to broadcasters to provide for the use of such channels may not provide for the ownership of those channels specifically dealing with that point."

1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4524.09,4524.759,Yes Your Honor.
1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4731.52,4744.658,"Now, is that -- insofar as your argument does rely on the First Amendment, that seems to me an extraordinary thing to say that Government can make judgments as to what -- what it will suppress and what it won't."

1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,4810.623,4812.912,"Well, that's the language of the unanimous opinion of the Court."
1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4812.912,4817.662,"Well, that language of the First Amendment says, “Congress shall not abridge,” doesn't it?"

1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5102.5,5104.647,That's correct.
1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5208.393,5211.099,"Well, they can't buy unless the networks sell it."
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5211.099,5211.28,If the networks sell it.

1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5241.47,5242.45,That's -- that's correct.
1972.71-863,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5242.45,5245.959,"So their freedom not to sell time for this purpose, that's the issue, isn't it?"
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5245.959,5247.612,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."

1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5604.256,5605.079,-- it stands for.
1972.71-863,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5605.079,5607.143,What's inconsistent with the Communications Act?
1972.71-863,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5614.76,5634.161,"Well, I was -- I think that the -- the provisions of the Communications Act that we would say the FCC is not dealing within its present ruling or one, the fact that these are publicly own airwaves, Section 301."
1972.71-863,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5662.991,5669.088,"Well, I thought you were addressing yourself to just the statutory aspect?"

1972.71-863,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5968.621,5971.834,Did you make the same argument with respect to the newspaper?
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,5971.834,5973.294,Would I make the same argument with respect to --

1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,5981.023,5986.5,I think it would -- it would present a different -- a different issue Mr. Justice White that we need not reach in this case.

1972.71-863,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5998.346,6000.949,Like a broadcast station?

1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6024.813,6032.371,The -- the petitioners seek to justify the exclusion of editorial advertisements on two distinct grounds and I think this should be kept in mind.

1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6197.019,6201.037,-- and the broadcasters have quite clearly suggested that there is an analogy.

1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6235.089,6235.49,Pardon me?
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6235.49,6237.225,-- the newspaper was characterized as a purely private --
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6237.225,6237.542,Yes.
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6238.712,6242.594,It is the same distinction Justice Stewart has been making.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6242.594,6243.76,That's right.
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6305.222,6325.509,"Mr. Asher the language following that quoted portion that you referred to in the United Church of Christ case went on to say in effect that the -- when they come to the renewal of their license, they're held to an accounting of their stewardship in terms of whether they've been operating on whim and caprice or whether they've been operating in the public interest."
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6334.766,6348.452,"I think that that's -- that maybe quite right Mr. Chief Justice, but what the Commission has established in this case is a policy that when a broadcaster's license comes -- renewal comes up, and every three years, each broadcaster's license comes up."

1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6668.601,6674.833,Have you said all you're going to say -- addressed to the point that broadcasters are Government?
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6674.833,6675.081,No.
1972.71-863,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6824.091,6840.246,But can -- can you really make that serve a distinction between a marketing of commercial time and the other aspects of the broadcasting business when you're trying to decide whether or not this is a state or governmental action?
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6840.246,6853.188,"I -- I think -- I think you can make -- you can make the distinction, Mr. Justice Rehnquist only -- only as follows, well, the Fairness doctrine sweeps across the entire board of -- of the -- of broadcasters dealing with controversial issues."
1972.71-863,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6877.3,6888.174,"But in order to decide whether or not it's governmental action, the -- the Court would have to adapt some general principle not just to say that in these two particular cases its governmental action and we'll worry about others when they come here."
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6898.644,6911.084,"Well, yes, I think -- I think so.So certainly if in -- if in a broadcast station's offices an employee tripped and -- and would hurt himself, he wouldn't have to assert his rights under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6940.017,6955.683,If that's -- if that's true then -- then I don't see how a broadcaster who would have any power whatsoever to limit or censor anything on -- on his station.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6955.683,6960.819,"Well, I -- I -- limitation and censorship may perhaps be the same Mr. Justice Stewart."
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6972.957,6975.041,Well that's -- that's an equal protection argument.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6975.041,6975.598,That's right.
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6975.598,6976.983,That's very much what it sounds like really.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6976.983,6977.407,That's right and I think the --
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6977.407,6993.47,"I think that that's an argument not a -- that too, it depends first of all upon the equating a broadcaster with Government but equal protection is something else and that's really what -- you would agree I think that the Court of Appeals' opinion is heavily larded with equal protection (Voice Overlap)."
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,6993.47,6997.066,"Oh, right, and I am trying to make my argument accord with that."
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7035.125,7037.977,You say that government can limit speech and it does all the time?
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7037.977,7039.492,Oh I think -- I think there's no doubt about it.
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7044.607,7044.945,Time and place (Inaudible)
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7044.945,7052.169,"(Inaudible) time, place, and manner are perfectly permissible while one may have a right to speak in -- in the Capital building during (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7052.169,7054.842,"Time and place, not -- certainly not by the -- by the --"
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7054.842,7055.536,Certainly not --
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7055.536,7056.26,-- by way of the content.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7056.26,7063.627,"Certainly not on the basis of the content and if on a content at all, certainly not on the basis of the fact that controversial speech will be excluded."
1972.71-863,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7063.627,7069.577,"About responsible speech, speech by responsible people as contrasted with irresponsible people."
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7074.762,7086.66,"It's -- it's a -- it's a very, very difficult distinction to make Mr. Justice Stewart and -- and certainly this Court has -- has many -- many cases suggested that the -- that regardless of whether or not one is -- what is responsible."
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7126.417,7145.402,"Now, let's take that last two hypothetical you gave, suppose a city had an ordinance that it would grant licenses permits for parades, for people in noncommercial categories that is to advertise their views on war or public health or whatever."
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7156.22,7161.706,"Well, this Court has certainly suggested that in terms of -- in -- in cases such as Valentine and Breard."
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7161.706,7166.026,"Well, haven't -- haven't they made -- hasn't the FCC made a classification here?"
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7166.026,7167.439,"Yes, but it's an inverse classification."
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7167.439,7167.834,Yes.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7168.382,7168.857,Instead of -- instead of saying --
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7168.857,7169.361,I noticed.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7182.016,7182.628,I think we do.
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7204.289,7206.28,"Well, it hasn't done quite that though, has it?"
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7220.594,7237.761,"Oh we have numerous classifications but -- that we will allow political speech by political parties to raise money, we won't allow it for other purposes, which -- which in a way touch -- touches upon another unreasonable aspect of -- of the entire scheme that seems to be evolving here."
1972.71-863,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7278.807,7290.529,"Mr. Asher, when the States involve -- they put up the overwhelming state interest, what did the broadcasted agencies put up as their overwhelming interest with it?"
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7290.529,7298.313,"Well, we've been -- we've been hard-pressed to try to find any -- any of the interest that have been -- been asserted by the broadcasters that -- that can be regarded as overwhelming."
1972.71-863,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7305.988,7307.685,Regulating their own time?
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7307.685,7308.488,I beg your pardon.
1972.71-863,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7308.488,7311.998,Regulating their own time.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7311.998,7313.841,The broadcasters regulating their own time?
1972.71-863,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7313.841,7315.992,Yes.They only have 24 hours in a day.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7315.992,7316.499,That's right.
1972.71-863,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7316.499,7317.287,Yes.
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7317.287,7323.083,"And -- and no -- no one is questioning the broadcasters' right to regulate it in term of saying, “We're going to market so much to sell to others."
1972.71-863,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7327.283,7331.438,Then your only point is that you're restricted because it's controversial?
1972.71-863,4,42352,thomas_r_asher,,7331.438,7332.639,That's right.
1972.71-863,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7725.504,7727.035,Thank you Mr. Asher.
1972.71-863,5,43692,vernon_l_wilkinson,,7737.594,7743.387,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1972.71-863,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8049.352,8052.521,"But you didn't give time here, did you?"
1972.71-863,5,43692,vernon_l_wilkinson,,8052.521,8053.604,We have given --
1972.71-863,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8053.604,8055.901,Did you gave time in these cases here?
1972.71-863,5,43692,vernon_l_wilkinson,,8055.901,8061.74,I thought in response to this particular request that there is no complain by the DNC.
1972.71-863,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8061.74,8065.789,"Well, I -- I don't understand your argument, you give somebody else time, but you wouldn't give them time."
1972.71-863,5,43692,vernon_l_wilkinson,,8065.789,8071.069,"We -- we have give DNC time on occasion, on the ABC Network, yes."
1972.71-863,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8211.254,8212.686,Thank you Mr. Wilkinson.
