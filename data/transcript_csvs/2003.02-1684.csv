2003.02-1684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.082,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1684, Michael Yarborough v. Michael Alvarado."
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,61.279,63.53,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.021,140.396,"Ms. Chuang, there are two questions presented in the petition for certiorari."
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,155.628,156.704,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.704,157.364,Thank you.
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,157.364,172.512,"The Ninth Circuit fundamentally changed the rule for resolving custody claims by juveniles and, second, Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court refers... is limited to the Supreme Court's holdings."
2003.02-1684,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,189.686,191.051,But how is it a new context?
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,216.807,218.831,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,220.029,233.215,"Then why do you need a new, special Supreme Court to say a very young person might feel very differently about whether he's in custody from a person who's a... not... not a child and not a minor?"
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,233.215,247.232,"--Well, because this Court's precedence as for custody determination has only considered the circumstances encountered by the person--"
2003.02-1684,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,247.232,249.379,"Well, we haven't considered blind people either."
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,267.599,279.655,--I believe that the answer is that the ultimate inquiry for custody determinations is whether there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom of movement.
2003.02-1684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,279.655,281.679,How old was the respondent in this case?
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,283.536,284.158,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.584,296.062,"And I suppose, in the view of the Ninth Circuit, he would have had to be treated quite differently if he were 6 months older, if he were 18."
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,296.062,297.548,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,297.548,299.367,I thought--
2003.02-1684,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.367,299.86,--What... what if he were 6?
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,304.485,317.86,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that a 6-year-old... that age and experience should be considered because the test... the ultimate inquiry is whether there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom of movement."
2003.02-1684,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.86,328.429,"No, but that depends upon what a reasonable person in the circumstances would understand to be his situation whether a reasonable person would believe he was being detained."
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,354.435,362.154,We don't deny that a 6-year-old would certainly be more vulnerable to overall coercion.
2003.02-1684,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,377.448,378.441,Why... why isn't it?
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,421.016,440.335,"--Well, Your Honor, I suppose that a blind person, if you hand the blind person a note saying, you are free to leave, would not... you could not use that note as an indication that he was free to leave."
2003.02-1684,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.572,453.033,"Well, isn't what you're objecting to in the Ninth Circuit's decision the idea that there is some sort of a bright line cutoff date when the person turns 18?"
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,461.39,464.195,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,464.195,467.522,Is that... I thought you said age is irrelevant.
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,467.522,469.214,Yes.
2003.02-1684,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.214,473.3,That age is... you... you said age is irrelevant to the custody determination.
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,473.3,474.415,That's correct.
2003.02-1684,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.87,482.838,Other things like language is... language is relevant if the person doesn't... is not conversant with English.
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,482.838,520.649,"--Language might not be relevant, Your Honor, because... or... or it might relevant because if the person did not understand English and the officer said, you are free to leave, that is... that is a circumstance that the person encountered that is within the officer's control that the... and the person doesn't understand English, that would be something that could not be relied upon later on to show that he was... he understood that he was free to leave."
2003.02-1684,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,526.594,530.188,Let... let me ask you about two facts in... in this particular case.
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,600.033,605.4,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe they are relevant."
2003.02-1684,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,605.4,605.689,Why... why not?
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,606.144,630.088,"Because once... again, if his... if his parents were asked for permission to interview, the detective had asked the parents for permission to interview him, and his parents said yes, the meaning of that question was that he could have said no, and--"
2003.02-1684,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,630.088,630.338,Wait a minute.
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,633.782,641.112,"--He could have refused to have submitted to the interview, and there's no indication in the record--"
2003.02-1684,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,641.112,642.931,"Well, but he... but he... he didn't."
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,648.542,651.598,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,654.115,654.941,And why is that?
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,659.316,662.455,"That... yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,663.836,667.163,"You don't know whether he would have felt free to say that or not, do you?"
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,668.854,671.454,--There's no indication one way or the other.
2003.02-1684,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,675.996,677.316,"Well, there is an indication."
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,732.855,744.894,"Well, Your Honor, I... I... there's no indication, though, that he was at the station involuntarily."
2003.02-1684,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,747.495,749.231,"Well, the indication is that his parents brought him."
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,750.262,758.064,"--Well, Your Honor, Mr. Alvarado... it indicated in the record that Mr. Alvarado lived at home with his parents and that he did not have a car."
2003.02-1684,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.064,759.178,"He's a minor, isn't he?"
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,759.178,760.377,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.377,763.099,"He has to go where his parents tell him to, doesn't he?"
2003.02-1684,0,20714,deborah_jane_chuang,,805.452,823.163,"Well, Your Honor, I... I believe that custody by... custody in the sense of a parental and juvenile situation is not the same as custody as you are under formal arrest or restrained in freedom of movement to the same degree--"
2003.02-1684,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.163,824.361,"Well, then that's the whole point."
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1255.768,1264.684,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1684,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1272.281,1285.035,Do you agree that the fact that the parents brought the person to the station and that they were... requested to be in the room it... are... are not relevant to the custody determination?
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1285.035,1295.892,"I think that they can be considered by the court in determining the... the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, just as in Oregon v. Mathiason they considered the fact the... the person came to the station on his own power."
2003.02-1684,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.892,1302.169,So that they are relevant to the objective inquiry whether or not a reasonable person thought he was under custody in these circumstances.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1302.169,1311.496,I think that they are facts that can be considered by a... under the reasonable person standard to determine whether a reasonable person would have felt that he was not free to leave or rather that he was under formal arrest at that point.
2003.02-1684,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1311.496,1313.686,So you disagree with the State on that point.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1313.686,1319.259,I... I think it's a... it's a slightly different viewpoint because I... I don't think that's what the Ninth Circuit was getting at.
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.661,1349.314,"But it is true there was testimony on it, is it not?"
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1349.314,1350.178,--I--
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.178,1360.209,The... the... page 2 of the red brief gives transcript cites for... as Michael... his parents asked if they could come in and Detective Comstock refused to do it.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1360.209,1371.066,"--I... I... I don't... unfortunately, I... I left my transcript at my seat, but it may be that the defendant testified at the trial itself that that is what occurred."
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.066,1372.059,J.A. 49--
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1372.059,1375.774,"In any event, we don't have any findings from the State court about what exactly transpired."
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.882,1379.489,--But your view is different from your colleague.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1382.673,1392.333,"--That's correct, that there are no findings on it and that we have the lawyer's assertion and we may have... I... I don't recall... the defendant's own testimony at the... the trial itself."
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1401.211,1409.012,But do you think the child whose parents were denied permission to come into the room would draw any inference about whether he could leave at... anytime he wanted to?
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1409.012,1420.612,"--Again, I think it depends on how it was put because if they just say, no, you may not come in, I think a reasonable person could conclude from that that they're exercising control over the interrogation and that they... that might extend to whether or not he's free to go."
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.129,1438.778,"Do you think it would make a difference in that inquiry if the person being interrogated was 35 years old, on the one hand, and 10 years old on the other hand?"
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1438.778,1453.843,"--I think that it doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes, and that's our basic argument, is that Miranda doesn't... didn't develop a rule that provides protection tailored for the specific circumstances of... of the person who's under interrogation."
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.152,1466.436,And you're telling me that the 35-year-old example and the 10-year-old example should be treated precisely the same.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1466.436,1469.818,--I think that they should be treated the same for purposes of the Miranda prophylactic rule.
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1472.419,1473.041,For the purposes of determining whether he thinks he's in custody.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1473.041,1474.155,"Yes, that is correct."
2003.02-1684,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.703,1491.244,A person of borderline competency who doesn't speak the language is... we don't consider that a--
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1491.244,1496.817,You don't consider that for purposes of the... of the altering the reasonable person view.
2003.02-1684,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.59,1516.962,--All right.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1526.045,1527.531,--But one of the reasonable under the circumstances--
2003.02-1684,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1527.531,1527.781,Is that the point?
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1527.781,1529.35,"--It's not quite right, but it's getting there."
2003.02-1684,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1529.35,1529.517,No.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1530.26,1541.034,The point is that one... one of the important factors to determine when you're figuring out what the totality of the circumstances is that you apply the reasonable person test to is what police officers told the person about his freedom to leave.
2003.02-1684,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1541.877,1542.315,I understand all that.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1565.349,1571.499,--I... I think that you can consider... I think we might be saying basically the same thing but just slightly different--
2003.02-1684,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1571.499,1572.779,I want you to say it--
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1572.779,1573.977,--I'm trying to get--
2003.02-1684,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1573.977,1575.38,--so that I understand what your statement is.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1575.38,1590.506,"--Is that the... is the... is that the person... you can consider what the police officer communicated to them, and when you're figuring out what the police officer communicated to them, the police officer doesn't get to, you know, pretend that a blind person can see."
2003.02-1684,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1655.877,1664.96,"On... on your view of this case, is it... suppose we say, all right, reasonable person doesn't mean 16."
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1677.675,1690.8,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think that a remand isn't necessary because I think that what the State court of appeals did is approximately right, or at least it's within the range of reason."
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1757.014,1757.18,I really don't understand.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1770.349,1778.977,"Justice Stevens, our point is that basically we don't require police officers to figure out the mind-set of 16, 17--"
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.977,1779.515,I wish you would tell me yes or no on my question.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1779.515,1781.828,"--I... I think the... well, I've already forgotten what it is."
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1783.026,1783.564,Let me... let me restate it.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1795.907,1799.417,"--I think if... in generalities, yes, that's true, but I also--"
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.417,1800.327,But then isn't age relevant?
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1800.327,1806.864,"--No, it's not relevant because I think Miranda... we... because it's a prophylactic rule, it's a supplemental protection in addition to the--"
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1806.864,1807.053,No.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1807.053,1808.334,--voluntariness test.
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.334,1809.904,Just relevant to the question whether he's in custody.
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1813.042,1813.292,Right.
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.368,1819.115,"And if it... if it makes a difference of his age, why doesn't that make it relevant?"
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1819.115,1822.709,--Because what we're talking about here is not just 6-year-olds.
2003.02-1684,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.229,1852.552,"But it's relevant by even a tiny, tiny bit if you've got a totality of the circumstances test."
2003.02-1684,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1858.375,1873.728,"--Justice... Justice Stevens, our point is that it's not relevant because the law says it's not relevant, that the police officer... all they're accountable for is the way a reasonable person would view the circumstances, and they shouldn't be required to figure out... get inside the head of a reasonable 16-year-old, a reasonable 15-year-old."
2003.02-1684,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.322,1878.231,"Thank you, Mr. Elwood."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1880.832,1885.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1684,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.151,1912.039,Was that based on testimony presented in the district court?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1912.039,1914.928,There was no evidentiary hearing in the district court.
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1917.075,1920.213,Then how... how did the district court know to make a finding?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1920.213,1923.762,--I believe they based it on the petition for habeas.
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.498,1926.074,Well--
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1926.074,1926.9,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.9,1930.328,--A written petition?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1939.327,1942.521,"No, there was no evidentiary hearing in the Federal court."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.521,1943.514,Then--
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1943.514,1945.288,And there was no testimony in the State court either.
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.288,1949.208,--Then what is the basis for the finding?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1949.208,1960.808,"At the motion to suppress in the trial court, in the State court, the argument was, in both the written motion to suppress and the oral argument in front of the court, that the parents were refused permission to attend the interview."
2003.02-1684,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.583,1980.87,"So... so you're saying it was the subject of evidence at one point, but in a different proceeding, and... and when the record of the different proceeding was used here, no one objected to it."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1980.87,1982.728,No one objected to it.
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.297,1986.405,"You're saying it was... it was the subject of allegation, not of evidence."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1986.405,1987.77,"--Yes, certainly."
2003.02-1684,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1994.623,1994.995,Okay.
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,1994.995,1997.307,Secondarily--
2003.02-1684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.307,1998.71,What's RT?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2002.219,2005.73,--That was the reporter's transcript from the motion to suppress at trial... pretrial.
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.543,2072.315,"Well, and your... your argument is that you think the fact that he thought he was a suspect would make him less likely to feel he was free to leave?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2072.315,2072.937,--Yes.
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.438,2132.462,"That... that was not a Court opinion, was it?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2132.462,2136.177,"I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.177,2137.746,You're citing it and you don't know?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2137.746,2138.944,Is it a plurality?
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.944,2140.597,It was a plurality opinion.
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2140.597,2142.47,"Plurality of this Court, yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.519,2187.12,"What... what good does... does a Miranda... I mean, you know... warning... what... what good does it do if you... if you recite it to a 6-year-old?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2208.956,2222.618,"--If you were to recite a Miranda warning to a 6-year-old, in the waiver determination they would decide whether that 6-year-old understood the waiver of his rights, and the evidence would come in there as well."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.618,2226.788,"Oh, so... so that even the giving of a Miranda warning would not suffice."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2226.788,2229.86,The giving of a Miranda warning doesn't suffice.
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.787,2237.273,"Well, coercion of what?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2279.543,2283.424,"However, if you cite a Miranda warning to a 17-year-old, it may."
2003.02-1684,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2283.424,2296.966,"Well, counsel, the... the person to whom the warning is given must be found to have waived the rights so warned and to have understood that a waiver was being made."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2297.709,2298.49,That's correct.
2003.02-1684,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2298.49,2301.12,"So I... I think that's the answer, isn't it?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2301.12,2301.796,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2301.796,2307.861,"So... so that means you cannot interrogate a 6-year-old, neither in custody nor out of custody."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2313.228,2314.343,Usually--
2003.02-1684,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2315.186,2320.349,Isn't the question whether we're going to--
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2320.349,2320.537,I... I--
2003.02-1684,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2320.537,2323.981,--Isn't the question whether we're going to treat them and prosecute them as adults?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2323.981,2325.805,--That's... that's right.
2003.02-1684,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.805,2328.2,And we don't... we don't do that with 6-year-olds.
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2328.2,2329.52,And in most circumstances you're not prosecuting 6-year-olds.
2003.02-1684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.832,2347.353,"What is the evidence or the indication here that the State did not take account of the fact that he was a juvenile, but having taken account of it in the State proceedings, they just reached the conclusion that it didn't in this case matter that much?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2350.408,2357.384,"When you read the California State opinion in this case, they don't mention Michael's age."
2003.02-1684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2364.897,2373.609,"I can understand why they might not... they would mention things that did matter, but if they thought it hadn't mattered here, why would we have expected them to mention it?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2373.609,2379.719,Is your question if they thought it didn't matter?
2003.02-1684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.719,2385.292,"Well, I mean, is our only indication that they didn't take it into account the fact that they didn't mention it?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2405.248,2414.892,"Well, the objectively unreasonable thing about what the California court did in this case was they recited the correct test for custody, yet they completely failed to imply it."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2423.437,2438.298,"To... to what extent do we require a State court, when we're talking about the AEDPA rules, to be absolutely accurate in following, say, precedent of this Court?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2445.272,2452.042,"--As this Court has found, a totality means a totality."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.042,2463.848,"Well, then you say that in any... every single Miranda case, a court must take into account in its opinion every single circumstance that is mentioned in the record?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2463.848,2464.552,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.552,2467.236,"Well, then what... why do you say totality?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2467.236,2471.982,"Most certainly they should discuss the factors that make a difference, and in this case they didn't."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.006,2479.413,"Well, why should they have said that the age of a 17-and-a-half-year-old made a difference?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2479.413,2483.211,It's more than the age in this case.
2003.02-1684,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2493.12,2497.04,"Well, that's mentioned in the court's opinion, that they brought him to the station house."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2497.04,2505.297,"When they're talking about the facts, they take the facts from Detective Comstock's interview where she says, I called the parents and had them come down."
2003.02-1684,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.238,2510.043,That both Mr. and Mrs. Alvarado came to the sheriff's station with their son.
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2510.043,2510.869,Yes.
2003.02-1684,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2510.869,2513.554,"Well, so then they did talk about some of these circumstances."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2515.412,2516.731,They--
2003.02-1684,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.731,2517.557,It's right in the opinion.
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2517.557,2522.099,"--They didn't mention that they were refused permission, and they didn't mention that Michael was 17."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2527.755,2529.734,"Well, maybe they didn't mention that because it's not in the record."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2537.907,2546.246,"Well, part of the record were the... the trial transcripts which included the motion to suppress hearing, and... and the briefs cited to that and the motion itself."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2547.445,2559.827,"--I... I didn't... well, I... I'm not sure that you're required... or it's even proper to take into account allegations that are made in... in a motion to suppress when there's been no evidentiary hearing on them."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2560.077,2574.278,"Well, where they're not disputed by the prosecution and... and the judge finds no contrary finding and they're argued in all the briefs without the respondent saying that that's not correct, it seems reasonable that the court of appeal would... would take that as fact."
2003.02-1684,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2574.278,2590.913,"--Why should it matter in the... in the... why would a court say, oh, yes, I know that age could be... could be relevant, but this was a 17 and more... more than 17-and-a-half-year-old, closer to 18 than 17?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2603.173,2621.999,"I think even if Michael had been 18 and the court had no duty to apply a reasonable juvenile standard, there are plenty of facts that point toward custody in this case not only the parental involvement, but the very fact that this interrogation took place in an interrogation room at a police station."
2003.02-1684,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2621.999,2631.863,That's the question I asked Mr. Elwood and he... his answer was a remand wouldn't be appropriate because what the State court held was a... was reasonable.
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2631.863,2641.234,"What the State court held was objectively unreasonable because they... they failed to apply the clearly established Federal law from this Court, which is Thompson v. Keohane."
2003.02-1684,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.776,2648.005,In... in what respect?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2648.005,2659.644,"In the respect that that case says you need to look at all of the circumstances surrounding an interrogation, and once you add up those circumstances, you decide whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2757.398,2757.564,"You're... you're not meeting their argument, though."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2809.167,2810.653,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.653,2811.396,"Now, what is... what is your response to that?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2811.396,2814.906,"It is an objective determination, and nobody is arguing that it should be subjective."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.878,2839.593,"Well, every subjective inquiry uses objective factors."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2870.096,2871.211,There's a fine line here.
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.55,2900.067,"Yes, but not in this particular context."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2900.067,2904.154,In the context of custodial interrogations and the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2910.72,2918.401,"But up... up to now, it's been concerned with respect to the custody inquiry to the external circumstances of... of the person."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2937.431,2941.639,"Mr. Chief Justice, I... I respectfully disagree."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2954.643,2963.187,"Well, but you say juveniles, and you're saying the 17-and-a-half-year-old will not assess his freedom to leave in the same way an 18-year-old."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2965.416,2973.84,This Court in its juvenile jurisprudence has drawn lines with juveniles versus adults.
2003.02-1684,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2986.555,2989.322,"Well, it certainly matters for determining voluntariness of any statement."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2991.673,2992.499,"No, it wasn't."
2003.02-1684,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2994.068,2996.131,"That's kind of odd, isn't it?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,2996.131,2996.669,--It is.
2003.02-1684,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3007.526,3011.613,But never an assertion that the statements were involuntary.
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,3011.613,3012.993,"No, no."
2003.02-1684,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3012.993,3019.187,"And all of these things would be relevant in the voluntariness inquiry, would they not?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,3019.187,3019.93,"Yes, sure."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.93,3036.443,"If juvenility must be taken into account for the custody determination, how... how is it that it is not taken into account for the purpose of what the nature of the warning has to be, assuming custody?"
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,3044.466,3044.921,And--
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3044.921,3056.976,"Now, if... if, indeed as you say, relevant to this whole thing is... is the age of the person, we ought to have different Miranda warnings, an 8-year-old Miranda warning, a 17-and-a-half-year-old Miranda warning, and so forth."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,3056.976,3059.577,"--I have two things to say about that, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1684,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.149,3102.096,"And is it also not true that in many, many cases, voluntariness may remain an issue, for example, as in Oregon against Elstad."
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,3112.415,3113.901,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
2003.02-1684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3113.901,3118.238,Does that help your case or hurt your case?
2003.02-1684,2,42359,tara_k_allen,,3130.209,3135.699,"Sure you can, but voluntariness is retrospective, and Miranda is prospective."
2003.02-1684,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3162.614,3166.701,"Thank you, Ms. Allen."
