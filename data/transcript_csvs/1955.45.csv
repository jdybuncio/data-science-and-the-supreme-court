1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,23.534,25.647,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1955.45,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,25.647,29.79,You may proceed Mr. Levy.
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,29.79,36.52,This case is here on certiorari from the Pennsylvania Courts.
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,170.3,176.888,"In your statement of facts, you're not going give us anything except that is beyond dispute, is that it?"
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,176.888,178.495,Let me clarify that Your Honor.
1955.45,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,365.389,368.894,How long was the time of that prior plea has gone down?
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,368.894,371.199,"Prior plea was two years before, I believe."
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,911.05,921.695,"You would think -- you think that kind of a question -- that kind of -- on here, that's frequent, I'd rather go to the chair than get a life sentence or judges say that, a lawyer say that."
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,926.789,927.068,I would --
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,927.068,935.43,"Of course, anything only formality's act, that they now go to the electric chair because they could -- they didn't think to -- because I want to go to the electric chair."
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,946.206,946.797,Well --
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,946.797,950.47,Doesn't cut your argument but it does touch the support in this.
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,950.47,954.08,"I -- I would say in answer to that, Your Honor, that of course there's really no way to find out."
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,954.08,957.044,"Precisely, that's why it shouldn't be pressed as an argument."
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,957.044,968.911,"Except insofar as the reports generally, maybe relevant to the question of the seriousness of these two things, even if we cannot believe all conducts of status."
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,968.911,969.07,"Well, I know (Voice Overlap) --"
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,969.07,970.509,I think in terms of acquitting --
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,970.509,972.269,-- as a serious business in the lights of that.
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,972.269,972.735,Precisely.
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,972.735,980.654,Addressing myself to this psychological speculation that seems to me to becloud the actions here and sort of (Inaudible)
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,980.654,994.164,"It may, I -- I would prefer the rest it actually, in terms of this being virtually as serious as a death sentence with a difference and quality, not having any effect on what a fair trial is going to be."
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1029.203,1029.441,Why is that?
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,1029.441,1030.55,-- want to examine the fact.
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1030.55,1032.425,We've had that firstly.
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,1034.077,1034.924,That's right.
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1049.233,1049.475,And if the (Voice Overlap) --
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,1049.475,1050.607,-- on exactly those same circumstances.
1955.45,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1050.607,1055.321,-- the man who still lives has a chance to get out and the man who still had no chance to get out.
1955.45,0,27460,herbert_monte_levy,,1063.415,1063.598,Yes.
1955.45,1,36299,marjorie_hanson_matson,,2610.248,2612.854,If the Court please.
1955.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2758.628,2761.372,What were those dates again please?
1955.45,1,36299,marjorie_hanson_matson,,2762.17,2764.189,April -- April the 30th.
1955.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2764.189,2764.368,Yes.
1955.45,1,36299,marjorie_hanson_matson,,2764.368,2766.24,And the rule was granted in June.
1955.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2766.24,2766.66,"Oh, yes."
1955.45,1,36299,marjorie_hanson_matson,,2766.66,2772.743,And an answer was filed by the District Attorney's Office in August of that year.
1955.45,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,2873.803,2874.056,Do you mean --
1955.45,1,36299,marjorie_hanson_matson,,2874.056,2876.967,"Here, with Stephen Herman, who was picked up, held incommunicado question --"
1955.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2876.967,2880.396,"Before you get to that Ms. Matson, may I ask you this."
1955.45,1,36299,marjorie_hanson_matson,,2900.095,2914.105,"The rule would have -- have required their application and I suppose we could have moved to strike the pleading on the ground if it not being verified.Perhaps, Mr. Zelt will be able to give some explanation as to why it was not."
1955.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2922.704,2928.572,"That is, it would have no greater legal effect if -- if it had been verified?"
1955.45,1,36299,marjorie_hanson_matson,,2928.572,2934.134,"Well, I wouldn't want to go quite that far, I think, that it could have been stricken off for not being verified."
1955.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2940.083,2941.013,Yes.
1955.45,2,46668,wray_g_zelt_jr,,3484.256,3491.008,May it please the Court.
1955.45,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3543.662,3549.52,"Well, Mr. Zelt, did -- did this man have any hearing on his habeas corpus proceeding?"
1955.45,2,46668,wray_g_zelt_jr,,3549.52,3554.741,"Not on the question of the truths or falsity of -- of his allegations, Your Honor."
1955.45,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3554.741,3557.174,"Well, what did he have the hearing on?"
1955.45,2,46668,wray_g_zelt_jr,,3557.174,3558.638,"Well, he didn't have a hearing of --"
1955.45,3,36299,marjorie_hanson_matson,,5562.126,5572.268,I wanted to have it be perfectly clear on this matter of the 72-hour detention that that occurred prior to September the 8th.
