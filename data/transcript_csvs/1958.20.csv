1958.20,0,33881,kenneth_r_king,,16.212,22.828,May it please the Court.
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1195.54,1203.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1249.004,1249.664,May I ask you --
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1249.664,1250.012,Yes you may.
1958.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1250.012,1253.617,Was she under subpoena here and was she under bond to testify?
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1253.617,1255.471,The record does not say.
1958.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1255.471,1256.766,What is the fact?
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1256.766,1261.776,"The fact I assume is as stated by Mr. King, that just as he states."
1958.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1262.851,1264.66,But she was under bond to --
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1264.66,1268.635,"That's what he states, and I'm sure that what he states is correct."
1958.20,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1293.587,1295.099,Why do you say that?
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1295.099,1327.718,"I say that Mr. Justice Frankfurter, because I say it on the basis two cases I would like to cite to Your Honors, and also on the basis of Mr. Wigmore's treatise, one of them is not cited in our brief because as I start to say, we rather assume that since the record showed nothing indicated the opposite of voluntariness, in other words compulsion, therefore she was a voluntary witness and should be assumed by the Court to be a voluntary witness."
1958.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1329.308,1341.53,"How can you -- how can you quite say that when she is not only under subpoena, but she is under bond to testify?"
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1354.238,1377.152,"Because Mr. Chief Justice, in order to assert a privilege, the witness has to be called into court and she may consent to testify and she may refuse to testify, and it is only when she refuses to testify that any element of compulsion may come into the case, and it is my basis for that statement."
1958.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1410.055,1412.462,"May I ask you what the citation is to that case, I don't --"
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1412.462,1417.878,That is 117 Fd at 156 and 163.
1958.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1417.878,1418.747,Not in your brief here?
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1418.747,1419.81,No sir it's not --
1958.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1419.81,1421.935,117 Fd or Fd 2nd --
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1421.935,1424.649,"117 Fd, yes sir."
1958.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1424.649,1425.87,Page what?
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1425.87,1429.355,156 and particularly at 163.
1958.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1429.355,1430.713,(Inaudible)
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1430.713,1433.185,United States against Kimbell.
1958.20,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1433.185,1437.356,I'm surprised you don't refer to Chief Justice Marshall's ruling.
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1437.356,1439.09,I'm not acquainted to that.
1958.20,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1439.09,1446.048,"(Inaudible) If subpoena could be issued to the President of the United States it doesn't follow, that he can be compelled to come."
1958.20,1,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,1446.048,1451.893,"That's quite correct, that's quite correct."
1958.20,2,18092,byron_tunnell,,4850.949,4856.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of this bar."
1958.20,3,33940,kirby_w_patterson,,6273.824,6274.575,Yes sir.
1958.20,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6274.575,6275.382,Thank you.
