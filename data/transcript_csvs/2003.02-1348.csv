2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.371,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1348, Olympic Airways v. Rubina Husain."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,78.928,79.505,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,191.293,207.557,"I take it you don't take the position that...  that, let's say, any death resulting in part as a result of one, but not the only, cause of the preexisting conditions is thereby excluded from the...  the class of liability."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,207.557,209.498,I think you have...  Justice...
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,209.498,218.331,"Every...  in other words, having a heart condition does not immunize Olympic Airlines against liability if somebody dies of a heart attack per se."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,219.696,233.237,"Our position is that if somebody is on board an aircraft and they die of a heart attack, that is...  that is not an...  that's a...  the passenger's own internal reaction and it just happened to be...  the passengers happened to be on board the aircraft."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,233.237,240.38,"Sure, if...  if they're simply sitting in the seat and nothing unusual happens and they have a heart attack and die, sure, there's no liability."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,263.907,264.528,"Well, no."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,271.587,288.017,And...  and they say the injury-producing event is...  or one of the...  the analyses is the unexpected refusal of the airline personnel to allow this individual to get moved into a smoke-free zone.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,310.02,324.593,"I respectfully disagree with the characterization, which was adopted by the court below, in that in this case you have to...  you...  you can't just simply look to the fact that you had the flight attendant saying we're not going to move you."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,327.026,332.106,He was assigned a non-smoking seat which happened to be in a zone with smoke.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,332.106,346.634,"Well, in...  on board any aircraft, when smoking is allowed, you have ambient cigarette smoke throughout the aircraft, and in this case you have to look to...  it can't be disputed that this passenger reacted to the cigarette smoke and the injury-producing event indirect..."
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.634,350.515,But less in...  less in row 15 than in row 48.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,350.515,354.686,"That's...  that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,385.727,389.896,"Well, you say direct, are...  are you trying to make the...  the act omission distinction?"
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,389.896,404.386,"Well, the act and...  in one respect, but...  but in the broader sense, you have to look to is what has always been the event the courts have looked to, what did the drafters intend the event...  the...  the cause to be?"
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.549,414.045,No...  no one is...  no one is making the common...  I don't think is making the common law argument here.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,436.42,453.964,"But...  but that's what courts have done after the Supreme Court's decision here by the Court in Tseng because at that time, before Tseng, courts used to find that it didn't matter whether you had allegations of true negligence because we do have to look to..."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,453.964,458.96,"The...  the point is the allegations are not of negligence, which is a legal and normative conclusion."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,458.96,459.348,Yes.
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,459.348,469.362,"The allegation is simply, as a matter of fact, it is not to be expected that a stewardess would stand there and say, no, you can't move him."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,478.856,480.22,I...  I disagree.
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.375,486.43,"Well, it could and it is different from ordinary negligence."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,510.851,523.938,"I don't believe in the...  for purposes of the article 17 accident analysis, you...  you...  your...  you should or should be allowed or it's proper to go beyond looking to asking what is that injury-producing event."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,538.882,540.451,Which...  which is a matter of defense.
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,540.451,540.99,Yes.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,540.99,542.476,"Yes, it's a matter of defense."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,542.476,547.705,But Justice O'Connor's question and my question is...  is the question that goes to whether you get into court to defend.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,553.333,553.954,No.
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,553.954,561.911,But our questions were wasn't it unexpected in fact that somebody would be in the position that this passenger was in.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,561.911,578.225,"I don't...  well, I think that's where the courts below and where you get...  where you can cross the lines and confuse the concepts of negligence and causation in this case because here you could say was it unusual, unexpected for a...  for a...  when a passenger makes a request to be moved."
2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,589.659,593.996,Were there other seats available in the economy section?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,593.996,596.901,"There were other seats available, Chief Justice."
2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.901,598.099,In the economy section?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,598.099,599.213,In the economy seat section.
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,609.616,614.984,"And in addition, there were the no-revenue people who could have been asked to leave."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,614.984,631.824,"There were the non-revenue people, but when you look to the record, the only way you could determine the non-revenue people...  in fact, we had to submit post-trial submissions after the trial to...  for somebody to testify to interpret the codes that were on the passenger manifest to determine who were revenue and who were non-revenue."
2003.02-1348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.824,633.643,"This doesn't have anything to do with the case, does it?"
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,633.643,634.469,"No, it doesn't, Your Honor."
2003.02-1348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.008,635.546,So what are we talking about it for?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,638.025,638.973,It's not...
2003.02-1348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.973,640.542,The issue before us is whether it was an accident.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,640.542,641.573,Exactly.
2003.02-1348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.142,643.968,May I ask this question?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,666.259,671.189,"Under the circumstances, no, I don't think under...  for purposes of the Warsaw Convention, that would have been an accident."
2003.02-1348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.189,672.038,That would have been.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,672.038,673.153,It would not have been an accident.
2003.02-1348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,673.153,673.607,It would not have been.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,673.607,674.805,"Because again, the injury..."
2003.02-1348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.805,678.149,So then...  then you don't rely on a distinction for the action and non-action.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,678.149,686.322,"Well, because...  well, I do rely on the distinction between action and non-action because you could have an omission which in and of itself cannot be an accident."
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,695.133,696.891,"Well, why is this a pure omission?"
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,719.842,735.09,"The...  the bottom line of the allegations here were that the...  the flight attendant should have taken action to move Mr....  Dr. Hanson to another seat, and failure to do so would be..."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,735.09,736.288,And part of what...  part of what she had...
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,736.288,736.576,in itself an omission.
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,736.576,744.389,"Part of the picture is things that she affirmatively did do, and part are things she didn't do."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,760.353,767.867,Generally in...  under negligence law...  under negligence law a negligence can be an act or omission.
2003.02-1348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.953,783.759,"Yes, but you...  you say you wouldn't draw the distinction I suggested."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,790.341,796.928,"Because at that point, when he got back to his seat, he would be back to his normal assigned non-smoking seat."
2003.02-1348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,813.481,815.3,But I want to be sure I understand your position.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,828.713,832.678,"Under the Warsaw Convention, I don't think it would be an accident, and here's why."
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.343,867.312,I...  I take it...  I take it you think...  is it Abramson in the Third Circuit where they...  the...  the passenger can't lie...  lie down.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,867.312,869.17,"Exactly, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,869.17,871.193,You take the position that case is wrong?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,871.193,871.732,No.
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,877.555,881.557,That's...  that's...  it seems to me there's an accident in that case.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,881.557,885.273,"In that case, the...  the court of appeals found there was not an accident."
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.273,887.297,"I understand, but it seems to me that there is."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,887.297,892.044,"Well, Abramson followed the...  almost the exact criteria set forth by the Court in Saks."
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,912.228,919.536,"Of course, there it seems to me that the...  the internal cause is...  is much greater than it...  it is here."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,933.942,935.056,We have to...
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,935.056,935.595,Now...
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,935.595,936.171,Yes.
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,936.709,941.167,"if we take the case on that assumption, it's...  it seems to me it's got to be an accident."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,941.167,956.855,"I disagree, Justice Kennedy, because again, I...  I just come back to when I was looking at all the cases and looking at the treaty and the text of the convention, you always do have to look to the injury-producing event because the text of the treaty says an accident which causes the damage."
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,982.422,987.873,But was it determined here that the passenger died from smoke exposure?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,987.873,993.612,There was at the...  there was a...  a legal finding that it was the smoke that killed the passenger even though...
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,993.612,995.963,And do we take the case on that understanding?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,995.963,1001.452,You would have to take the case on the understanding because we didn't raise the factual issue that he would have died from the food poisoning.
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1001.452,1012.394,And is it the case that there would have been seats possibly available more removed from the smoke so that it wouldn't have been as heavy an exposure to smoke?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1012.394,1017.156,I don't...  I don't think there was any evidence to establish the concentrations of the cigarette smoke.
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1029.871,1032.66,But here there was a total refusal to...
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1032.66,1034.146,"There was a...  well, there was a..."
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1034.146,1034.888,to provide any help.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1034.888,1042.857,"There was a refusal to...  there was a refusal to move him because the flight attendant believed the flight was full, and it was, other than the 10 seats."
2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.565,1053.26,"Well, you...  you say you have to consider just very precisely what caused the injury."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1055.839,1062.981,What caused the injury was his exposure to the cigarette smoke under the facts of this case and on the findings.
2003.02-1348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.81,1088.04,"When you say the...  the airline gave the passenger the option to reseat himself, wasn't it the option to...  to request another passenger to change seats with him?"
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1088.04,1089.526,To change seats with him.
2003.02-1348,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.526,1089.692,Yes.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1089.692,1096.479,Or he could have...  what the...  or he could have moved through the cabin to see if he could locate an empty seat.
2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.75,1110.868,"Well, but does that make...  does that make any difference in...  in this case, the fact that his wife was speaking for him?"
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1110.868,1111.34,No.
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.392,1157.642,How about other courts?
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.642,1161.562,"I mean, we do look to see what our treaty partners do in this area."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1171.388,1172.131,Yes.
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1190.502,1191.366,What about the court of appeals in England...
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1191.366,1192.109,that...
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1192.109,1195.164,that disagreed on the...  on the...  whatever that...
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1195.164,1196.733,"Yes, the DVT litigation."
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1196.733,1205.073,"Disagreed on that, but did say, went out of its way to say, it thought that this case was the right way to go about it."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1205.073,1216.18,"Well, the...  on the DVT litigation case, the court found that...  he disagreed with the reasoning of the lower courts, but he said that he could certainly understand the result."
2003.02-1348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.35,1221.631,"Well, that's surely dictum anyway."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1221.919,1222.557,"Yes, well..."
2003.02-1348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.557,1226.999,the dictum in that case that...  that he thought that this case came out right below.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1235.294,1236.863,"You're...  you're right, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1252.095,1257.092,"I don't think so, having read his decision and the other members of the court of appeals."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1257.092,1259.943,What was Lord Phillips' misperception?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1259.943,1270.345,"As to the enforced exposure to the cigarette smoke because...  because the passenger here was given the option to relocate, and he could have relocated himself."
2003.02-1348,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1270.345,1274.06,The option being...  the option being the one that was mentioned a moment ago.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1277.033,1280.126,Switch or find another...  one of the available empty seats.
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1284.296,1286.896,She...  she said positively there are no empty seats.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1293.09,1298.496,"Sure, because...  because at the time, you know, there were only 11 empty seats, and she said that the plane is full."
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.516,1311.172,"But by the time the second and third inquiries were asked, it should have been evident that there were empty seats."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1311.172,1319.262,"Well, the...  the second inquiry was just before...  shortly before takeoff on...  on a flight delayed for 3 hours, and they're trying to take off, and she says, I can't help you right now."
2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.349,1326.943,"Well, but the...  I wouldn't think they allowed smoking before takeoff."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1326.943,1328.8,"No, they did not allow smoking before takeoff."
2003.02-1348,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1364.587,1373.01,"If Tseng had held nothing on this point, in fact, it...  it said that the Second Circuit's conclusion that that wasn't an accident was doubtful."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1401.866,1402.172,No.
2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.648,1458.482,But are...  are you saying here that the court of appeals really wrote an opinion about...  in negligence and saying that's an accident?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1458.482,1464.798,"When you read the...  the language of the court of appeals, it's...  it's pure negligence language."
2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.798,1471.735,"But...  but it seems to me whatever you think about what the flight attendant did, it...  it can't be classed as negligence here."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1474.086,1475.572,It was a refusal.
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1490.97,1498.939,I don't know if we really have to get into the act versus omission question here because this was more than that.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1522.262,1536.873,"Well, I...  when I think of an event, I think of some type of positive action, and in this instance, when...  when I look at a refusal to do something, I look at it as...  as an omission."
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1562.219,1563.584,No request made?
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1565.442,1565.725,I'm sorry.
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1565.725,1566.468,Excuse me.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1566.468,1567.561,A hypothetical.
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.561,1568.12,Oh.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1568.12,1577.625,"Let's assume no request had been made, and he would have remained in that same non-smoking seat and he would have died because of the exposure to the ambient cigarette smoke, according to plaintiffs' theory."
2003.02-1348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1600.321,1612.06,"Well, but of course, the exposure might have been substantially reduced if the passenger had been able to get seated in an area further removed from the active smokers."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1612.06,1618.376,"There...  he still would have had...  there still would have been ambient cigarette smoke throughout the cabin, as we all well know."
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1618.376,1627.747,"Well, suppose there were five rows of empty seats in front and a...  a stewardess...  and there are stewardesses like this sometimes that we don't people wandering around the plane."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1630.969,1643.146,"No, not a different case because you are assigned to your assigned seat, and again, it's one of those extreme examples that if I believed there were five empty rows here, he probably would have gotten up and found it himself."
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1653.427,1659.183,"So your...  your submission is if the airline requires you to sit in the no-smoking seat for no particularly good reason, there's still no accident."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1659.183,1665.027,"Oh, I...  I disagree on that one because if they required you to sit in a non-smoking seat and you had..."
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1665.027,1666.308,"Well, that was my hypothetical."
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1666.308,1666.763,Okay.
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1671.1,1671.843,No.
2003.02-1348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1671.843,1673.533,One...  just one...  one row ahead.
2003.02-1348,0,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1673.533,1677.703,There would be no difference in the situation from this...  from our scenario.
2003.02-1348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.074,1705.734,"Very well, Mr. Harakas."
2003.02-1348,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1706.849,1719.359,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1348,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.08,1746.767,"Well, that's the question."
2003.02-1348,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1748.087,1757.375,I'm sorry if I said that kind of...  I meant to say that kind of action under Saks is contrary to...  to the normal industry safety practices.
2003.02-1348,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.375,1757.912,Let me ask about Saks.
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2893.642,2900.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1348,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.124,2962.374,Ms. McDowell...
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2962.374,2962.624,Yes.
2003.02-1348,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.624,2971.169,"assuming that it could have happened somehow in an airline context, would you say that Justice Scalia's hypothetical was an accident?"
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2971.169,2980.744,"I think that a failure of an airline employee to come to the assistance of a passenger can, indeed, be an accident."
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3014.552,3014.868,Okay.
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3033.461,3035.485,"Well, I think the inquiry here..."
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.485,3036.805,"You still wouldn't call it an accident, I don't think."
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3039.738,3046.797,"Well, I think here under the Warsaw Convention, the term accident has been understood to refer to an unusual, unexpected event."
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.797,3046.98,Okay.
2003.02-1348,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3046.98,3056.418,"But wouldn't you...  Warsaw Convention or not, wouldn't you call it an accident if the bystanders had put up an advertisement saying, swim with us for $500, and then they stood there?"
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3056.418,3059.8,"Yes, that would...  that would seem to be an accident."
2003.02-1348,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3059.8,3062.484,"That would get a little closer to our situation, wouldn't it?"
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3062.938,3063.764,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1348,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3063.764,3064.507,and that might well be an accident.
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3064.507,3074.993,"Other circumstances...  medical malpractice cases, for example, might be those where an omission of some sort, because the doctor is under a duty to act, could be viewed as an accident."
2003.02-1348,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3082.052,3092.249,"Would...  would you say that we ought to write the opinion so that if there is negligence, that is evidence that normal airline practices were not being followed, and that's an accident?"
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3098.649,3100.014,We would say that...
2003.02-1348,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3100.014,3102.364,Or...  or should we write the opinion without talking about negligence?
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3102.364,3110.992,We would say that the test is objective reasonableness which connotes some of the same concepts as negligence does in the common law.
2003.02-1348,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3110.992,3114.503,"Well, how does...  how does that differ from...  from the common law at all?"
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3122.426,3128.992,"Well, not in all circumstances because negligence isn't a necessary condition for an accident to occur."
2003.02-1348,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3157.515,3163.831,"Well, negligence is a proxy for the fact that normal airline operating rules were not being followed."
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3163.831,3165.605,Correct.
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.813,3214.813,"You know, I think there may be a public policy reason for construing accident contrary to its normal meaning to embrace in this context intentional acts whether by the airline employees or by pirates or...  or terrorists or anybody else."
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3246.225,3250.972,"Well, of course, in this case we don't have a mere negligent omission."
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.683,3271.86,"No, the misinformation didn't bear any causality."
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3285.418,3298.793,I don't think it's properly characterized as an omission when there were three increasingly desperate requests to reseat the passenger and the flight attendant responded on each occasion...
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.793,3299.026,I take it back.
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3299.869,3317.163,"I think that this sort of case can be contrasted, for example, from a...  a simple failure to warn case where the question is whether an airline should have warned about a particular medical condition that a passenger might have in response to ordinary flight."
2003.02-1348,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3368.517,3370.625,"Well, is airline's fault even required?"
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3381.232,3384.759,"It could well be an accident, Your Honor."
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3388.186,3388.641,Why wouldn't it be?
2003.02-1348,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.641,3391.696,There's going to be an accident within the meaning of the convention is what I'm asking you.
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3391.696,3393.925,"Yes, it probably would."
2003.02-1348,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.925,3401.068,"So then the smoke doesn't have...  the...  the...  whatever the accidental cause is, it doesn't have to be fault of the airline."
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3401.068,3414.647,That's correct because the airlines have the opportunity under article 20 of the convention to come back and say that we cannot be held responsible for this accident because we did not act negligently.
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3418.279,3419.272,I thought they had to show more than that.
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3424.352,3426.042,"Well, the term in the treaty is all necessary measures."
2003.02-1348,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3426.042,3426.514,Yes.
2003.02-1348,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3426.514,3430.418,But it's been construed to mean all reasonable measures.
2003.02-1348,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.454,3495.683,"Thank you, Ms. McDowell."
2003.02-1348,3,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,3498.2,3513.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think when you...  when you look at the arguments that were made both by the respondents and the Solicitor General, it all comes back to the issue of negligence, wanting to equate an accident with negligence."
2003.02-1348,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3684.348,3685.613,"Thank you, Mr. Harakas."
