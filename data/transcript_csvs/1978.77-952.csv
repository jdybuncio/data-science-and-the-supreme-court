1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,61.27,"We'll hear arguments next in 952, Group Life and Health Insurance against Royal Drug."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,65.628,69.863,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,165.799,168.492,I want to be sure I understood you Mr. Kaiser.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,182.825,183.517,"Blue Shield, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,183.517,192.48,Blue Shield and the insured expressly provides that Blue Shield shall enter into a contract with the suppliers?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,192.48,206.307,It expressly provides that the benefits will be provided to the insured through a participating provider and it obligates the insurer to enter into participating agreements with providers.
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,206.307,221.645,In other words that would be inconsistent with the insurance contract if Blue Shield itself were to go under the business of being a pharmacist and itself provided the in kind of --
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,221.645,224.26,With its policy it certainly would Your Honor.
1978.77-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,234.469,238.474,"Since, Blue Shield prescription couldn't have its own drugstores under the insurance policy?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,238.474,240.82,"No sir, not into this policy."
1978.77-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.82,257.154,"Mr. Kaiser, what is the business reason either from the point of view of the insured or the insurer for requiring in the policy between those two that Blue Shield enter into an agreement with providers?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,257.154,260.375,Your Honor that involves a little bit of history.
1978.77-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.228,337.497,Why did they insist on it?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,337.497,341.922,"They wanted full benefits coverage Your Honor, at a minimum cost."
1978.77-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.922,355.082,But couldn't they get that sort of coverage and leave it up to the insurer to decide how he was going to go about procuring the benefits?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,355.082,356.33,That could have been done Your Honor.
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,372.361,394.265,"In other words, the reason of the insurance contract contains that provisions that it does as largely and historic reason, it's not essential that the contract be that way that is if you're doing it now from scratch but there are historic reasons why the contract is as it is?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,394.265,402.803,The essential provisions in the policy dealing with benefits and coverage were all insisted and in fact demanded by the insureds and beneficiaries.
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,402.803,404.522,As matter of historic fact?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,404.522,405.627,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,405.627,412.947,Would it be fair to say in broader terms and you cast it that this was a response to the demand of consumers?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,412.947,413.935,No doubt about it.
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,416.07,419.163,"Excuse me, but it wouldn't be limited to just the automobile people?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,419.163,421.555,"No, sir and it has not been limited to the automobile people."
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,436.245,441.729,"But there's no real reason why this be tripartite, is it, is there?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,457.341,457.619,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,457.619,461.615,The beneficiary receives money directly from the insurance company.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,468.498,479.661,"There is really no distinction, no practical distinction to be drawn here with the way benefits are provided under our policy and the way benefits maybe provided under another traditional form of interest."
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.661,484.75,But this isn't inexorably a tripartite situation.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,489.346,497.67,"Well, I might add Your Honor that tripartite service benefit agreements already distinct the feature of the health insurance industry."
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,508.075,514.265,"Only what's full coverage when he wants money too when he has liability or accident insurance, he wants full coverage?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,514.265,515.001,That's right.
1978.77-952,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,515.001,519.169,But that that is not necessarily tripartite he just gets the money from the insurance company.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,519.169,532.751,"There is another distinctive feature of this particular type arrangement and that is that under a full coverage and when I say full coverage Your Honor I'm talking about no matter what it takes to make this person well, the insurance company will furnish those have insurance."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,532.751,535.845,It couldn't be full coverage if there is $2.00 deductible?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,535.845,536.386,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,536.386,537.814,"It isn't full coverage, is it?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,538.586,541.02,"Now, there's a $2.00 deductible here with each prescription."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,541.02,542.817,"So, that's not full coverage then is it?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,542.817,544.117,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,548.019,567.295,"Well, how is this any different in the old-fashioned automobile policy in which reliability policy which insurance company agrees to provide the defense if the insured gets sued and the company then hires lawyers to represent the policyholder and provides in effect the benefit in kind to the services of the lawyer?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,574.122,583.074,"Your Honor, I can't agree that the health insurance industry is anything at all like the casualty insurance industry because of the very peculiar nature."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,583.074,591.812,But the contractual arrangement between the liability insurance carrier and the lawyer who defense cases from time to time for the benefit of the policy holder.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,598.778,603.17,In as much as you're talking about that being a part of the benefits and coverage of the policy.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,603.17,603.706,Correct.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,603.706,604.375,There is really --
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,604.375,616.977,"Yes, No difference and so this case would be and if you're correct and you may well be that this is the business of insurance and then lawyers when they represent liability -- represent insureds under liability policies are equally engaged in the business for insurer."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,616.977,617.511,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,641.577,651.779,But it might well encompass a provider agreement when the agreement involves the provision of legal services to somebody who sued as the result of the automobile accident.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,655.346,659.012,"Well, Your Honor I'm trying to confine and I'm not arguing with the Court."
1978.77-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,659.012,661.467,I won't if I were you.
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,665.852,676.53,"Mr. Kaiser, you cannot distinguish between the variants and the case Justice Stevens opposed was services, here it's goods."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,676.53,678.12,"Goods and services, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,678.12,689.057,And unless someone can distinguish between those two variants from the normal concept of insurance that's very strongly in your favor.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,689.057,692.196,"No, I think that that is a normal concept of insurance as I understood."
1978.77-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.799,745.682,"Well, I happened to do disagree with my brother Stewart's comment that your answer that Justice Stevens' question helps you rather than hurts you and I don't see the bright line that you're talking about between an agreement on the part of and casualty insurance company with a law firm to defend its policyholders in lawsuits in which they're sued and an agreement with drugstores or pharmaceutical houses to provide drugs where the causality insured against is the need of drugs."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,745.682,754.946,"Your Honor, we think that the proper line is that an agreement -- a third party agreement which relates directly to the provision of benefits."
1978.77-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.25,775.603,But that Justice Stevens' questions meets everyone of the criteria you've just set forth.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,788.991,791.258,"Your Honor, there is no service benefit policy."
1978.77-952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.748,818.331,"So if the insured simply went ahead and as a part of the policy with the insurer when they have as a part of the policy with the insureds said, we're also going to draw up an agreement with the law firm to provide services to you and that's part of this policy then the two would be the same."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,818.331,828.563,"Your Honor, I think we're getting very close to prepaid legal services in many states which I have been proposed to be operated in just that fashion."
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,828.65,857.601,"Is it not true that some forms, some policies of insurance beside replacing the casualty loss, fire or whatever also provide a fixed amount for the lawsuit profits during the period when the building or the plant or the factory is being rehabilitated and you certainly would not say that that takes that out of the business of insurance because it goes that far, would you?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,857.601,871.496,"Your Honor, I can't -- without knowing the full terms of a policy and the requirements of the insurer, the obligations -- the contractual obligations of the insurer, I'm not really sure that I could comment on that."
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.879,888.816,Mr. Kaiser.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,888.816,889.369,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.369,895.094,I'd like to go back because I'm not all clear in light of the way you started your argument.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,933.918,944.693,"Your Honor, first of all let me and maybe I misunderstood you but we are not hinging our case upon the fact that this arose out of a collective bargaining agreement."
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,952.534,957.039,Demand it because it offers this coverage at lower rates?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,957.039,957.738,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.738,959.238,"Well, I hadn't heard you say that."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,959.238,963.094,It offers full coverage at lower rates.
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.094,965.037,At lower rates.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,965.037,969.306,And it guarantees the provision of benefits.
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.306,987.586,And it in a sense that protects I understood from your argument in your brief the Blue Shield Company and similar insures from the hazard of perhaps higher charges by pharmaceutical retailer outlets around the state.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,987.586,1005.028,"One of the principle policies behind the enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act was that insurance companies be able to maintain themselves, manage their own business subject to regulation by the states and that they'll be able to managing their business."
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.027,1042.522,"And for all of these, would you have thought Blue Shield would wanted this without regard to any pressure from labor unions?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1042.522,1044.391,"I'm sorry Your Honor, I didn't understand."
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.391,1058.271,I said for all of the economic reasons I would've thought Blue Shield as a business operation saving the public would want it this sort of contract without regard to any pressure from a labor union.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1058.271,1066.16,"Your Honor, this tripartite benefit arrangement polices have been in effect since the early 1930's."
1978.77-952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.9,1188.098,Does last terms Paul case have any bearing on this case?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1188.098,1193.425,"Your Honor, the St. Paul versus Barry case dealt with the three --"
1978.77-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1193.425,1194.395,St. Paul Insurance.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1194.395,1196.429,"Portion of the statute, the boycott exception."
1978.77-952,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1196.429,1197.875,Boycott Exception.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1200.407,1223.771,It has no direct barring but it does has some barring that I think it's very beneficial and that this Court said in St. Paul versus Barry that there is no indication in the legislative history of the Act that Congress intended to define the business of insurance in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary meaning or customary understanding that being the state of the industry at the time of the Act's passage.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1272.134,1281.747,May I ask about the words “every person engaged therein” is it your position that those words grant an exemption to the pharmacies?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1281.747,1285.813,"No, Your Honor, we're not saying that the pharmacies are exempt."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1297.541,1324.185,"Does that mean that if the pharmacy hold a trade association or similar meeting and say, “We'd like to increase by 15% the price of drugs on our schedule with this Blue Shield policy is that that meeting would be exempt and they implement it by then going around to the insurance company and say, “we want 15% more”, and you renegotiate the agreement with the group as a whole and come out with a higher drug price, is that exempt or is it not?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1324.185,1327.988,As I understand your question if there was collaboration among the pharmacies and then they went in the insurance.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1327.988,1330.881,If there are persons engaged in the “business of insurance” is my question.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1334.203,1342.859,We're saying that the pharmacy agreement constitutes the business of insurance and in order to effectuate the purpose of the Act both signatories to the agreement must be exempt.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1342.859,1351.355,"Well, then the other signatories exempt in so far as a collaborate with one another in determining what -- how to negotiate with Blue Shield about the price schedule."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1351.355,1361.223,"Your Honor, it would be our position and if the signatories collaborated among themselves went to the insurance said, “We want a 25% increase in the dispensing fee which you prepared to offer.”"
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1361.523,1362.57,"No, not the dispensing fee."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1371.189,1375.671,"No, Your Honor there is a formula -- a reimbursement formula for the pharmacist."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1379.029,1379.748,Right.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1379.748,1382.311,We pay him a dispensing fee.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1382.311,1383.916,"Oh, I'm sorry the dispensing is --"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1383.916,1386.299,"Plus, the acquisition cost of the drug."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1386.299,1387.736,Right.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1387.736,1389.843,That is the formula which is reimbursed.
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1410.258,1428.429,What about the action of the pharmacy trade association that Justice Stevens postulated their own action independent to whatever success they -- whatever agreements they had with the insurance company?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1428.429,1431.426,"Your Honor, we believe that if it --"
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1431.426,1442.934,You don't mean that their action in agreeing to fix prices would be completely immune when you're just talking about all the drug companies.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1442.934,1443.944,"I'm not really sure that I understand your question, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1443.944,1452.971,"Well, you postulated that a group of the drug suppliers got together and entered what amount and I took it to be a price-fixing agreement."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1461.266,1465.212,"If it stopped right there before they got to Blue Cross, it probably would Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1467.288,1472.893,Blue Shield is not the part of that consortium at that stage.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1481.867,1491.689,"Well, Your Honor most times, these prices or the establish reimbursement formula would be establish in a competitive atmosphere."
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1521.309,1534.872,But Blue Shield itself might be a victim of that price-fixing agreement if they couldn't buy any where else but suppose it was so pervasive that it covered that whole round of suppliers.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1534.872,1537.974,"Well, Your Honor that's -- I guess that is always possibility obviously --"
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1537.974,1542.258,"No, you will have antitrust violation and wouldn't you conceivably?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1542.258,1544.581,"Quite possibly you would, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1576.668,1583.607,"No, the reason that's beside the point is because the exemption if it applies would cover the conduct even if you did have an antitrust violation."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1591.023,1592.267,"Yes sir, I understand."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1592.267,1602.222,And you mentioned would be said in a competitive atmosphere but you're talking about competitions between Blue Shield and the drug companies rather than competition among the drug companies.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1612.45,1623.885,I think that's right Your Honor but as the Government said in its brief that the antitrust laws are or the purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect competition not competitors.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1630.528,1637.461,And the purpose of the exemption is to protect the competitors even if there is no competition at all even if there is collaboration.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1656.431,1664.977,"Yes, if there was incorporated in the pharmacy agreement, so our position that the pharmacy agreement constituting a part of the “business of insurance” that that would be exempt."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1664.977,1671.784,So that Blue Shield within effect have the power to grant the exemption if it were approved ultimately approved by the Blue Shield.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1671.784,1672.348,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1678.727,1682.854,When it comes of “business of insurance” as soon as Blue Shield signs the contract.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1682.854,1685.177,"Your Honor, the pharmacy agreement is the “business of insurance.”"
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1685.177,1702.662,I'm talking about a business price by the drug companies which ultimately Blue Shield could take or leave but ultimate if it takes it if I understand your position as soon as the insurance company signs up then that has the effect of conferring exemption on what would otherwise have been an illegal price fixing conspiracy.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1708.893,1710.465,"Well, I don't like the way it sounds but."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1710.465,1713.102,"Well, you're asking for an exemption from the antitrust laws."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1735.343,1736.96,"Well, Your Honor I don't --"
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1736.96,1739.317,"That lawsuit here too, I understand that."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1739.317,1741.333,Of course and that is really --
1978.77-952,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1741.333,1765.114,"Mr. Kaiser, suppose you have five drug manufacturers, who deliberately conspire in violation of every antitrust principle in the world to run up the price of at least all and that it put in, the insurance contract is protected?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1765.114,1767.509,Would we claim that to be the business of insurance?
1978.77-952,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1768.413,1770.397,Would that be protected?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1770.397,1772.135,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.623,1805.114,"Well, I'm telling about based on drugs."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1805.114,1808.048,"No sir, I think that would be too far removed if they took the manufacturer?"
1978.77-952,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.048,1827.09,"Do you mean the fact that -- they deliberately got together and then jacked up the price of one drug, five companies in deliberate violation of antitrust laws and insurance company took that price?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1827.09,1832.279,"Your Honor, I'm not sure I'm totally understanding are you talking about a manufacturer or a pharmacist?"
1978.77-952,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1832.279,1833.367,I said manufacturer.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1833.367,1842.636,"A manufacturer, Your Honor I think a manufacturer would be too far removed to come within the scope of the exemption of the business of insurance under the situation that we have here."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1842.636,1846.345,"Mr. Kaiser, your time maybe running a bit short."
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1867.236,1873.191,"Your Honor, initially, the State Board of Insurance in Texas absolutely disapproved the issuance on use of the policy."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1873.191,1874.949,But then it --
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1874.949,1875.972,Then it issued an order.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1875.972,1877.602,Yes.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,1877.602,1903.489,To prevent a competitive disadvantage with a foreign insurance carrier who was carrying on the same business in Texas and permitted authorized Blue Shield to issue and use this policy in the State of Texas specifically referring to the pharmacy agreement and the fact that Blue Shield would enter into participating providers to provide dispensed drugs to the policyholders under the terms of the contract.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1977.773,2003.388,"Well, I understood you say initially that the policy had been approved and now you say that it was exempted, and I so understood the opinion of the Court of Appeals to say and I have it before me that in September 1969, the Texas Insurance Commission of Insurance issued another written order exempting the policy from the approval requirement of the Texas Code, is that correct?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,2003.388,2005.711,"Yes sir, that's exactly correct."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2008.86,2012.475,"Yes, but what's the current status, is it approved or exempted?"
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,2012.475,2017.014,We have one policy that's being issues that is issued under an exemption order.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2017.014,2017.431,Yes.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,2017.431,2022.303,And one policy that's being issued under a flat approval order by the Commissioner.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2022.303,2023.706,Which is the more recent?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,2023.706,2027.985,The 1974 policy is the more recent and it's being issued under an approval order by the Commission.
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2027.985,2028.806,An approval order?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,2028.806,2030.184,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2030.184,2036.559,And all other laws with respect to insurance remain applicable even with respect to an exempted policy.
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,2038.549,2048.896,"Yes sir, the Deputy Commissioner of Insurance testified that with respect to -- there is no difference between an exempted policy and an approved policy as it applied to state regulation."
1978.77-952,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2052.514,2057.467,Of what does that regulation consists so far as this type of insurance then?
1978.77-952,0,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,2057.467,2062.866,"Your Honor, it consists of the traditional forms of prior approval of policies."
1978.77-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2102.352,2107.921,"Very well, Mr. Kaiser."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2110.496,2114.541,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.15,2208.048,Mr. Kaiser --
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2208.048,2208.276,Excuse me.
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.276,2217.186,Is that the testimony referred to on page 28 of your brief?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2217.186,2221.797,"I believe that it is, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.797,2226.396,Where does he say it's not part of insurance?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2226.396,2230.875,"I asked question, so that the record will be clear."
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.749,2244.669,Uh-huh.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2244.669,2255.867,"Answer: My personal opinion is that this particular contract that you showed me, then I said you're talking about the deposition exhibit 3, the pharmacy agreement."
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2283.907,2295.225,"Well, I'm reading that but why did the Commission report to approve a contract in 1974?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2295.225,2299.405,I believe if you look at the contract Your Honor and we covered this in our brief.
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.728,2361.943,"What if the state had chosen to regulate this contrary to your contention, would you say that you would -- should lose your case?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2361.943,2362.414,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.307,2387.253,But you say even if it constitutes the business of insurance if the state is not regulating it then and who was this person that you had on the witness stand that you were asking by these legal questions to?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2387.253,2394.379,That was Mr. Ferguson who was the -- I believe the Assistant Manager of the Department of Policy Regulation.
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2394.379,2395.744,Was he a lawyer?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2395.744,2396.07,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2408.681,2415.735,Was that the deposition on that testimony given prior to the 1974 approval of this policy?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2415.735,2417.879,"No Your Honor, it was given after the approval."
1978.77-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2417.879,2423.675,How did he reconcile that action of the Commission if indeed that Commission did act that way with his testimony?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2423.675,2427.089,"Well, the Commission only approves policy forms."
1978.77-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2430.011,2438.146,But I understood that the policy call for this agreement that we're talking about here this pharmacy agreement.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2438.146,2440.589,"No Your Honor, apparently I did not make myself clear."
1978.77-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2456.936,2462.865,It does say some about the price that which they will be furnished to the beneficiaries to which the drugs will be furnished by the beneficiary.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2462.865,2473.572,"Yes, in other words -- but the only thing there Your Honor again, nothing in the policy itself refers to a price fixing agreement."
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.219,2476.902,It didn't say anything about the cost to the insurance company --
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2476.902,2477.728,That is correct.
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.728,2484.315,Which in terms of the seller is the price to the insurance company?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2484.315,2484.974,"Now, I would like to also --"
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2484.974,2500.172,"Well, weren't they -- weren't the policyholders simply in the open market they brought drugs and paid the first $2.00 as I understand it on each proscription."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2503.693,2505.058,Blue Shield?
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.058,2505.657,Yes.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2505.657,2506.495,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2568.951,2571.466,How does -- you say that penalizes the pharmacy?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2571.466,2572.065,Yes sir.
1978.77-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.754,2618.377,"Well, not as it shows a boycott, I don't understand that."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2618.377,2633.096,Because Your Honor what the effect of the policy is to allocate the business of Blue Shield insurers to those pharmacists who have agreed to fix prices with Blue Shield.
1978.77-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.096,2641.827,I agree to accept the price Blue Shield is willing to pay is what you're saying which has to be a lower price than the others want for their drugs.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2641.827,2642.593,Yes sir and it's consistent --
1978.77-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.593,2644.57,I don't understand that to be a boycott.
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2644.57,2647.133,"Anybody can get in that participation, can't they?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2647.133,2649.157,"Yes, Your Honor but that's not the problem."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2660.822,2665.6,"Well, we're talking about now more about the merits I suppose and about the business of insurance exemption --"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2665.6,2673.744,"Well, we're talking about the boycott provision and the exemption Your Honor which I say is a matter that this Court should consider."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.744,2693.804,"Well, supposing would somebody have a retail drugstore have an action against the Bank of America because the Bank of Americard, it's kind of coerces people to go to drugstores that will accept the Bank of Americard even and take 5% off their gross as a result of it?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2693.804,2695.96,I'm not familiar without the Bank of Americard could work.
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2695.96,2700.02,"Well, any kind of credit card is going to have a certain coercive effect."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2700.02,2708.691,I think that's true Your Honor but let's look at this transaction and I think it will be very quickly demonstrated.
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2789.842,2791.327,Getting back to the drugs.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2791.327,2791.626,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2791.626,2803.902,What other interest does Blue Shield have other than to get for the -- its customers the lowest price drugs they can get?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2803.902,2806.106,"I don't know that that's their interest, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2806.106,2807.471,"Well, give me one other interest they have."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2807.471,2813.938,I think their interest basically is to increase the amount of money which they will retain out of the transaction.
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2813.938,2816.872,And in the meantime they get drugs cheaper?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2816.872,2818.25,That is questionable.
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2818.25,2820.214,And that --
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2820.214,2821.232,They do --
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2821.232,2830.154,"You just said so sir, you said that when they go to another place and they charge more, isn't that what you said?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2830.154,2831.052,I did use that Your Honor but --
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.052,2833.268,"But more means more, doesn't it?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2833.268,2834.034,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2834.034,2837.328,"So, the other place is cheaper, isn't it?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2837.328,2842.166,"It maybe as to a Blue Shield customer and the way that it operates, I would say yes it is cheaper."
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2842.166,2843.244,It is cheaper.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2843.244,2844.142,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2844.142,2857.795,"So, the persons that's buying the drugs or the person is buying the insurance is getting cheaper drugs at a cheaper price, and that's a crime?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2857.795,2858.334,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2915.592,2924.215,Isn't there a factor of the predictability of prices that goes into the actuarial activities of the insurance company involved here?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2924.215,2925.472,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2925.472,2932.694,They must know reasonably what the exposure of risks amounts to.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2932.694,2933.593,"Yes Your Honor, I agree with that."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2933.593,2940.587,"And if they're at the mercy of any one who wants to charge a higher price they can't predict the prices, can they?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2940.587,2950.598,"No, they can't predict the price but they can by specifying in their contract what they're going to pay predict their exposure on which their premium is based."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2985.713,2994.951,"But the participating druggists manage to accommodate themselves to the economics, do they not?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,2994.951,2996.791,"That is the question, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3002.001,3005.582,"Well, is there anything in the record here that would indicate that?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3005.582,3016.408,"There in some of the deposition testimony of some of the plaintiffs in my case, I believe you will find that Your Honor because there was inquiry about what's wrong of which you're getting and they say it's too low."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3020.061,3032.157,"On your approach to this thing although in some business they're not involved in this case, if you carried it to its logical conclusion you'd undermine the whole cooperative movement in the United States, would you not?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3032.157,3032.983,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.983,3039.87,"What produce bargain for the lowest prices and limit the areas of their purchase, do they not?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3039.87,3047.044,"Yes, Your Honor but I think here we're looking at something into determine not the cooperative movement but the “business of insurance.”"
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3047.044,3052.661,"Well, they've coupled the cooperative concept with the business of insurance or made it part they say --"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3052.661,3054.086,"Well, I would disagree with that statement."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3054.086,3056.294,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock counsel.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3074.134,3075.152,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3075.152,3091.26,Could I ask you if in the 19 -- in the approvals or exemptions of the policy forms that you were speaking about in 1974 and was it in 1969?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3091.26,3092.218,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3092.218,3098.386,"Now, weren't the provider agreements attached to those forms?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3098.386,3103.883,They -- as I recall Your Honor they were submitted with one of them and maybe near on this.
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.129,3114.051,"Well, submitted it was attached to the form, wasn't it?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3114.051,3115.069,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3115.069,3116.734,And how about in 1974?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3116.734,3119.109,"In 1974, I do not recall."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.684,3125.995,But what about was attached and the policy was approved?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3125.995,3134.738,I would still say Your Honor that all that would be approved would be the policy because that's all the state has authority to approve under the specifically under statute.
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3134.738,3138.858,Was the deposition of Paul Conner introduced in the evidence?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3138.858,3144.774,"Your Honor, this was on a motion to dismiss the deposition is before that was before the court and this Court."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.774,3145.685,"So, it is before the --"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3145.685,3145.913,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3145.913,3157.458,And didn't Mr. Conner testify that this provider agreement was part of insurance subject to the jurisdiction of Commission?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3157.458,3160.081,I don't think he did so too clearly and there is some debate about --
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3160.081,3163.662,"Well, too clearly I am --"
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3163.662,3166.524,"Perhaps, we'll have to decide that when we examine it again."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3166.524,3167.183,All right.
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.183,3174.656,But you do recognize that he looking in a little bit different direction in Mr. Paul?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3174.656,3177.111,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3177.111,3182.62,"Well, now, you suggest that they approve only the terms of the policy?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3182.62,3183.578,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3183.578,3195.554,"But the Commission had before it exactly the interpretation of the insurer as to the scope of that policy and the meaning of the language of policy, did they not?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3195.554,3210.193,"Your Honor, my reading of Mr. Ferguson's testimony was that this came in they did put it the file although they did not stamp it filed it I will just the matter which they received for informational purposes."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.48,3225.151,"Well, is this a question that would ultimately you said by a Supreme Court of Texas?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3225.151,3226.47,Was it ultimately decided?
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3226.47,3235.153,Is this a kind of question that would ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court of Texas whether the Texas Insurance Commissioner has what your furtherance jurisdiction over this matter?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3235.153,3236.36,It could be Your Honor.
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3242.564,3245.058,"Well, then you're not relying on the deposition?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3245.058,3248.339,"No, I am relying on deposition very much so."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.339,3259.118,"Well, do you really think that's the way you establish what might be a fairly important question to state law to have conflicting depositions of two agencies subordinates as to what they think the state law provides?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3259.118,3269.585,"No Your Honor, I think you have to look at the state statute and when you look at the Texas State statute when it talks about what will be filed, it is insurance policy forms."
1978.77-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3288.028,3290.843,Then you don't need the depositions from --
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3290.843,3304.903,"No sir, I think it helps considerably because he's the man who is enforcing the Texas law and this is how it does operate."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.799,3475.53,"When you say they can tell them, I'm not sure what you mean."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3477.554,3478.38,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3478.38,3481.135,"Well, participating pharmacy it doesn't have to participate."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3481.135,3497.77,"No, Your Honor, but this is where the percentage comes in because what they do the way the program is set up with the non-participating pharmacist and the penalty that an insured suffers if he deals with a non-participating pharmacist."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3505.123,3511.231,"Mr. Pullen, tell me specifically, what's wrong with that in your view in antitrust terms?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3511.231,3521.351,"Your Honor, in my opinion, that is a price fixing conspiracy and it is a boycott and it is a conspiracy to boycott and it's been very successful."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3530.141,3543.195,It's price fixing to take your terms in a sense that the participating druggist agreed to sell at a lower price.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3543.195,3545.052,At one fixed price Your Honor.
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3545.699,3550.058,And the lower price solved ore you wouldn't be here I assume?
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3550.058,3562.992,"Well, what I was trying to say again and apparently for the second time I have not articulated it very well is that the ultimate price which their customers will find acceptable will be a price fixed by competition."
1978.77-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3633.305,3642.754,"Well, we're not all concern here with the merits of the antitrust claim but merely whether or not the defendant is under the statutory exemption."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3660.598,3660.838,Yes sir.
1978.77-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3660.838,3664.778,Within the many exemption and that's all but we're not interested in the --
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3664.778,3667.592,I understand that Your Honor.
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3667.592,3690.407,"Could I ask you, assuming you're right that these provider agreements are not regulated by the state, well doesn't Section 2 of the McCarran-Ferguson Act say that the Sherman Act does apply to the extent the state doesn't regulate of certain phases in the insurance business?"
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3690.407,3694.706,That is my understanding Your Honor.
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3694.706,3712.67,So that even if you might consider for purposes of the McCarran-Ferguson Act these provider agreements to be within the contemplation of the word “insurance” but other words insurance business.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3718.958,3721.281,That would be certainly my understanding.
1978.77-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3721.281,3728.108,But it doesn't have the record to regulate under its insurance commissioner; it can regulate through his antitrust laws or any other way.
1978.77-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3728.108,3731.33,But it doesn't purport to regulate them at all I gather.
1978.77-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3731.33,3741.617,"I wonder Mr. Justice Stewart is right because Section B says, it will supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3744.492,3752.444,I have some question about it Your Honor in looking at the McCarran Act legislative history.
1978.77-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3817.176,3825.559,"Well, the question is to whether it supply after the fact, the question is whether it's a law enacted by a state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3825.559,3828.074,As compared to just regulation of business in general?
1978.77-952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3828.074,3828.613,Yes.
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3828.613,3828.973,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3828.973,3836.147,"Well, Section 2 (b) has no such limiting language and that's the, I thought that's the exempt Section that was an issue in this case."
1978.77-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3836.147,3843.663,I've been quoting from Section 2 (b).
1978.77-952,1,32367,joel_h_pullen,,3843.663,3848.938,"To continue Your Honor, the matter is not one sided."
1978.77-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3915.658,3918.46,"Very well, Mr. Pullen."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,3933.191,3936.509,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3995.653,3997.916,"Mr. Allen, I just want to be sure about this."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4020.555,4036.502,"Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, there are two portions to Section 2 (b) which maybe the source of some of your confusion but under either portion if a activity is not the business of insurance it makes no difference whether the state law regulates it or does not."
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4040.01,4043.496,"Well, let me be sure I get my confusion cleared up because I am confused."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4053.065,4059.892,"No part, excuse me, no part of 2 (b) would grant an exemption from the antitrust laws if there was no state regulation."
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4059.892,4060.299,Right.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4060.299,4060.958,Does that answer your question?
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4060.958,4067.533,"So, that then in my hypothetical, there's no exemption unless there is state regulation which authorized that particular arrangement."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4067.533,4071.892,That is true even (Voice Overlap) even if the activity is the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4071.892,4073.374,Alright.
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4073.374,4078.06,State regulation doesn't have to authorize that just as to be state regulation?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4078.06,4078.826,That is correct.
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4078.826,4091.042,"And the language to which my brother Stevens adverted in Section 2 (b) I'd already understood as referring to none preemption prior to June 30, 1948."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4095.234,4095.821,That's my understanding Mr. Justice.
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4095.821,4097.988,After June 30 of 1948?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4097.988,4102.401,That's my understanding too.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4102.401,4109.063,Isn't true that all the state law would have to do is purport to regulate provider agreements?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4114.121,4115.666,That's my understanding Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4116.252,4128.397,"And that even if the provider agreement was in violation of state law you have to leave the policing up to the state authority, it's not with the antitrust laws?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4128.397,4132.216,If the provider agreements are part of the business of insurance that --
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4132.216,4133.212,Yes.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4133.212,4134.062,But if they were not at court --
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4134.062,4136.803,"Yes, I understand right."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4136.803,4144.996,The issue presented by petitioner's motion to dismiss and the issue before this Court is simply whether the pharmacy agreements are part of the business of insurance --
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4144.996,4149.667,I hate to take up all your time on my confusion but I think it is important that I understand the statutes.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4160.283,4161.555,Section 2 (b).
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4161.555,4164.787,And read me the words that you talk about.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4164.787,4184.937,"The pertinent portion I think is they provide it that after June 30, 1948 the Act of July 1819 know as a Sherman Act, and the Act known as Clayton , and the Act known as a Federal Trade Commission Act shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is no regulated by a state law."
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4184.937,4187.979,And does it at anywhere say and you say by reverse implication --
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4187.979,4194.793,By reverse implication that would suggest that if it were regulated by a state law those particular Acts would not apply.
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4197.847,4199.752,I understand that.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4207.465,4217.214,That's my understanding although of course under our position it wouldn't make difference because under our position it's not the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4217.214,4220.136,"Well, the words the “business of insurance” are found in that Section 2?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4220.136,4220.436,That's correct.
1978.77-952,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4220.436,4221.023,Alright.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4222.089,4223.035,That's quite alright.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4223.035,4235.486,"Well, I would suppose the first part of 2 (b) would set aside any state law that was in conflict with the antitrust laws."
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4235.486,4235.957,"Would not be, isn't it?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4235.957,4242.903,The first part of 2 (b) provides no Act of Congress shall be construed to supersede according from memory.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4242.903,4243.565,That's right.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4243.565,4246.053,Any state law enacted for the purpose of regulating insurance.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4246.053,4247.239,Including antitrust laws?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4247.239,4248.964,Including the antitrust laws.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4248.964,4253.024,"So, it would not apply if it serve to --"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4253.024,4253.551,Supersede.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4253.551,4254.797,To supersede a state law?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4254.797,4256.821,That is correct.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4256.821,4265.62,"So, the first part of 2 (b) would give insurance business exemption from antitrust laws if --"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4265.62,4266.917,That is correct Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4268.761,4275.228,"Well, and why do you say it's a latter part?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4277.384,4280.737,"Well, let me modify my position, it is not only the latter part."
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4287.594,4288.331,But the first thing --
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4288.331,4289.636,The first part would include the Sherman Act as well as --
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4289.636,4292.091,Sherman Act and every other federal law.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4292.091,4293.594,That's correct.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4294.709,4303.583,It also includes the Robinson-Patman Act the first part of 2 (b) and which is not referred to and that exempts in the proviso?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4303.583,4305.057,That is correct.
1978.77-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4349.13,4352.137,"That's implicit exemption, isn't it?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4352.137,4357.022,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, this Court has applied that principle even in the case of express exemptions."
1978.77-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4367.441,4376.685,Do you think that one applies the principle of narrow construction equally to express exemptions as to imply the exemption?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4376.685,4379.484,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4439.236,4454.912,"What is your response to what we suggested this morning on the universal practice of public liability insurance insuring not only against the risk of ultimate judgment against the policyholder but the cost of litigation, is that --"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4454.912,4460.173,My response is that that example is a good illustration of our point.
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4471.767,4474.459,How about the provision in the policy itself?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4474.459,4485.765,Even if it's in the policy itself it simply begs common ordinary understanding to say that an agreement between an insurance company and a law firm about how much they're going to pay per hour is the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4485.765,4489.531,Isn't also true that medicine is part of health?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4489.531,4493.271,That's true too Your Honor and our argument that will follow.
1978.77-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4493.271,4500.085,"That they can -- well, as the paying of the doctor's bill insurance?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4500.085,4514.277,The paying of the claims to the insurer -- to the policyholder is the business of insurance and an agreement between the insurance company and somebody who provides services is we contend not the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4514.277,4515.678,Including the doctors?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4515.678,4519.031,"Including the doctors, including the pharmacists, there's no difference between pharmacist and doctors."
1978.77-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4519.031,4530.016,"Then under the Group Health Plan it wouldn't be covered, wouldn't the insurance would because they pay the doctors?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4530.016,4532.783,"I'm not certain, I understanding to your point Mr. Justice Marshall --"
1978.77-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4532.783,4533.975,They pay the doctors.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4536.26,4537.206,That's true.
1978.77-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4537.206,4538.523,"So, that wouldn't be insurance then?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4538.523,4541.577,The hiring of the doctors would not be the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4541.577,4542.236,What if the --
1978.77-952,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4542.236,4543.733,It wouldn't be -- they wouldn't be covered by this?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4543.733,4546.587,It would not be part of the business of insurance and maybe perfectly lawful.
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4550.41,4577.536,"What if forgetting any problems of legal ethics or anything, what if an insurance company just had a stable of lawyers, its employees that it furnished under its insurance contracts to beneficiaries who were sued for liability, would those employment contracts with the lawyers pay the business of insurance?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4577.536,4579.44,I think not Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4589.257,4596.27,"If it's not clear, then why is it so clear that if the insurance company does the same thing with independent contracts is it all of a sudden becomes very clear?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4596.27,4603.324,"Well, it seems to me basis for distinction between one's dealings with ones own employees and ones dealing with outside contract."
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4603.324,4615.175,"In each case, the insurance -- the insurer is furnishing the services and what difference has it whether so far as this exemption goes whether it does so through its employees or through independent contract?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4615.175,4623.618,"Well, I think as I say my first response would be that I don't think labor relation agreements between an insurance company and doctors --"
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4623.618,4629.307,"But you don't make the labor relations agreements, they're employment contract, no point in giving out a fancy name."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4629.307,4640.371,"Between insurance company and its doctors, my first reaction was I don't think that will be the business of insurance although I think the question there would be closer because I think there's a basis for distinction."
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4666.889,4675.32,"Now, you don't seriously contend that the promise to furnish to defend that person in a case of an accident is not insurance."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4675.32,4676.757,"No, the promise is insurance to deliver in the pharmacy --"
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4676.757,4685.021,"Alright then, I wouldn't think you would think -- if there's been an accident the companies called upon to furnish the legal services that were promised."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4688.003,4689.466,"No, I agree that that would be insurance --"
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4689.466,4694.117,And if they're going to furnish to legal service they're going to have to pay for them?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4694.117,4696.483,That is correct but only in the same sense.
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4696.483,4707.819,You wouldn't if the insurance company goes out to an independent law firm and hires them to furnish the services that were promised; the furnishing of those services is part of insurance business?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4707.819,4710.112,"Well, we can say no because --"
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4710.112,4712.73,You just said so.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4712.73,4714.819,"The furnishing of the services to the policyholders, that's right."
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4714.819,4721.925,And but you wouldn't think that the negotiation the price at which that they were furnished was part of the insurance?
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4721.925,4731.268,Negotiation between the insurance company and the lawyer we would contend does not the business of insurance because there is no principle basis for distinguishing that kind of agreement between insurance company --
1978.77-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4731.268,4744.015,"Why not draw the line and say well, perhaps that piecemeal negotiation is one thing but a forward contract, they're sort of a supply contract in the indefinite future is something different."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4745.302,4750.295,Because the any kind of any distinction on that basis would break down.
1978.77-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4750.834,4760.766,"Any distinction breaks down and what about the contract of purchase the paper on which the policy is written, is that part of the business of insurance?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4760.766,4762.82,The contract that purchased the paper?
1978.77-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4762.82,4764.547,On which the policy is printed.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4764.547,4780.403,We would contend it would not be and that a conspiracy between printers to fix the price of printing services which used an agreement within an insurance company to do too to implement that conspiracy is not what Congress intended to exempt from the antitrust laws.
1978.77-952,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4780.403,4788.307,"Well, the insurance company could be a plaintiff in an antitrust lawsuit against the paper manufacturers who agreed to fix the prices."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4788.307,4789.014,"Exactly, we contend it would be."
1978.77-952,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4789.014,4790.2,It could be a plaintiff here.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4796.475,4799.11,Under our contention -- but not on the petitioner's contention.
1978.77-952,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4799.11,4800.547,"No, no I think --"
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4800.547,4802.724,He responded to that this morning.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4802.724,4804.02,But not consistently.
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4804.02,4815.887,But the point is that now we have an agreement with them between the insurance company and the pharmacist to provide services and the question is whether or not that is the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4815.887,4825.404,And our response is that it is not because if it were then everything in an insurance company would do to save its own costs of services would be the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4825.404,4828.679,"Of course, perhaps that's the answer."
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4828.679,4829.039,But Mr. Kaiser --
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4829.039,4830.876,But Congress did not so intend.
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4832.451,4858.165,I understood Mr. Kaiser this morning when I put the question to him to say that the action of the drugs -- drug people together independent of the agreement with Blue Shield could be an antitrust violation and one of the ways that could be asserted would be for Blue Shield to sue them because they were pushing the price up; price fixing agreement.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4858.165,4864.144,That's correct Mr. Chief Justice but the distinction is important.
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4880.201,4884.081,It doesn't know his response to that was that would not render them.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4898.273,4900.678,"Well, I don't understand that to be their position Your Honor."
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4902.415,4905.623,I understood that very clearly that it was his position.
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4905.623,4912.259,But if that's his position what he saying is that then we can violate the antitrust laws by entering into an agreement with pharmacist --
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4912.259,4914.322,"Well, that's sort of exemption from the antitrust laws mean."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4914.322,4918.476,And the pharmacist would be guilty of antitrust and we would not.
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4918.476,4928.387,"Well, that's exactly an exemption means that you can violate, you can engage in conduct which would be violated of the antitrust laws if you didn't have an exemption."
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4928.443,4938.902,"But what this Court has established is that the McCarran-Ferguson Act didn't intend to immunize entities that intended to immunize conduct, agreements practices --"
1978.77-952,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4938.902,4941.298,"Except that a business, the business of insurance?"
1978.77-952,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,4941.298,4941.765,That's right.
1978.77-952,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4944.879,4946.314,"Very well, Mr. Allen."
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,4950.424,4960.005,Thank you.
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4983.778,4988.105,"Well, what if Blue Shield joined the conspiracy?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,4988.105,4990.82,Your Honor that if we are a victim of a conspiracy ---
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4990.82,4991.778,I didn't say that.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,4994.149,4998.233,Under those -- like we have two different circumstances under my theory --
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4998.233,5001.108,"Well, yes I know but I'm asking about mine now."
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5004.85,5008.924,"Alright Your Honor, if Blue Shield was a party to the conspiracy --"
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5008.924,5013.839,Remember they are carrying out the business of insurance according to your view.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5013.839,5028.138,It would be my initial impression right now that if the agreement was embodied into the pharmacy agreement and it is always been our position that the pharmacy agreement is immune as a part of the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5029.336,5030.773,Blue Shield would be immune?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5030.773,5031.492,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5031.492,5035.013,How about -- and but nevertheless I suppose you say the druggist --
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5035.013,5042.546,For the separate conspiracy between the druggist there maybe an actionable that maybe actionable conspiracy.
1978.77-952,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5042.546,5053.732,But Blue Shield is at least an ordinary human experience isn't as likely to -- isn't very likely to enter into conspiracy to raise their own costs?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5053.732,5058.658,"Not at all, Your Honor that would be totally against our own interest and the interest of our policyholders."
1978.77-952,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5058.658,5062.67,"So, the hypothesis is at least economically not very real?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5062.67,5064.575,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5064.575,5073.497,Unless they get together to keep Blue Shield from going too low and Blue Shield gets paid off in some way?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5073.497,5075.88,"Yes, I guess that is the possibility Your Honor."
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5075.88,5079.174,"Well, it has been true, hasn't it in some places?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5079.174,5080.235,Not to my knowledge Your Honor.
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5084.654,5092.918,Is the price fixing agreement have to be the fix maximum prices to be unlawful supposing it's an agreement to fix prices is much lower than anybody else can charge?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5092.918,5100.032,"Your Honor, there's considerable dispute about that but as I read the cases of price fixing can either be to fix maximum prices or minimal price."
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5100.032,5103.254,"It may be illegal either way, would it not?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5103.254,5105.266,Strictly from the antitrust from an act standpoint.
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5105.266,5118.919,So they could have a lot of group of large druggist who wanted to have a very low price in order to drive small companies out of business for example and persuaded Blue Shield to go along with it and that would normally be an antitrust violation?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5118.919,5128.248,"Well, I'm operating my thoughts are under the theory that Blue Shield would offer this agreement to everyone; somewhat to possibly be able to accept some possibly not."
1978.77-952,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5128.248,5131.951,"Is there any limitation now, can anyone be a participant?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5131.951,5138.416,Any license pharmacy in the State of Texas has been invited and is capable of becoming a participating pharmacy.
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5138.416,5159.853,"Mr. Allen to be sure that my confusion is completely cleared up, do you agree with the view that in order to qualify for the exemption under Section 2 (b) of the McCarran Act you must establish both that you're in the business of insurance and secondly that that which you claim is an exemption is regulated by state law?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5159.853,5160.751,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5177.01,5181.578,I take it that the court below did not reach the second step.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5184.945,5187.568,The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not reach the second step.
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5192.897,5195.009,But the Court of Appeals didn't reach that second?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5195.009,5195.586,No sir.
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5225.476,5235.344,It's true that the exemption however exist only at the exemption for the business of insurance exist only to the extent that it is regulated by state law?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5235.344,5236.067,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5236.067,5243.301,"So, and your opponent in part 2 I think it is what the brief asserts that this is not regulated by state law."
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5246.617,5248.904,"Yes sir, well, I just want to make our point clear."
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5256.073,5262.54,But the federal standard upon that federal standard is that the business of insurance has to be regulated by state law?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5262.54,5263.079,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5263.079,5277.81,But suppose the state says that the dealing in drugs is not an insurance function and therefore we will not regulate it.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5279.235,5281.091,My position would still be the same Your Honor.
1978.77-952,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5292.984,5297.403,"Well, if they said it was and they did move and it would be a very question."
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5297.403,5298.212,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1978.77-952,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5298.212,5306.044,"If they said it was an insurance problem and did regulate it, it would not be a federal?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5307.601,5309.637,"I think its still would be a federal consideration, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5338.116,5344.703,"Well, what would some of those things be -- let's assume a company that's an insurance company nothing else --"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5344.703,5344.931,Yes.
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5344.931,5346.416,It's not a conglomerate or anything.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5351.266,5355.326,As the Solicitor General has said that the contracts for the purchase of paper (Voice Overlap) the buildings --
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5355.326,5357.278,"Well, how can that be the building of insurance?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5357.278,5357.997,That I would say it would not --
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5357.997,5361.361,If it's in the insurance business then it has to buy paper.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5361.361,5373.218,"Your Honor, the federal courts and this Court has said that the key is not whether or not it's in the insurance business but the business of insurance and there's a difference --"
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5373.218,5378.955,"Well, it's in the business of insurance and then conducting at business it has to have policies?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5378.955,5380.021,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5380.021,5385.817,"Whether written or printed on paper and why therefore, shouldn't its purchase of paper be the business of insurance?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5385.817,5391.985,Because there is not a requisite relationship between the insurer and its policyholder in that situation.
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5391.985,5400.249,"Well, about the paper used for -- that that they send out to the policyholder to submit claims on?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5400.249,5405.983,That still would not really involve the claim -- the risk --
1978.77-952,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5405.983,5410.104,Condition of the policy is that you file a claim on this form?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5410.104,5415.841,"Your Honor, I think that would be too attenuated to the business of insurance to become an exempt to activity."
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5415.841,5421.458,What about the between the insurance company and the lawyer to employees to defend the casualty case?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5421.458,5421.985,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.77-952,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5421.985,5422.89,"Now, we're back where we started."
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5422.89,5430.136,I want to go back where we started on the lawyer hired by the insurance company to defend the policyholder who sued under a liability policy.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5430.136,5430.747,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5430.747,5433.43,Would that be the business of insurance?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5433.43,5436.771,If it was an obligation contained in the policy of insurance?
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5436.771,5439.586,"The policy says, “We'll defend all claims.”"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5439.586,5440.104,And if it was --
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5440.104,5444.703,It doesn't say by lawyers or how but then they go and hire lawyers to defend the claims.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5444.703,5452.715,If it is a part of the coverage and benefits provided by the policy and if it is something that is eminently related to the insured --
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5452.715,5454.817,"Well, I don't think I don't need any adjectives."
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5459.993,5461.625,I think it might be Your Honor.
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5461.625,5462.464,You think it might be?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5462.464,5462.978,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5462.978,5471.151,You're not very confident and yet I don't see any difference between that in providing drug as I indicated earlier.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5475.283,5476.874,"Your Honor, it's the difference between that."
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5494.241,5501.247,"Supposing you pay money and you go out and borrow money from a bank to pay off a claim in dollars, is that the business of insurance?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5501.247,5502.565,If the insured?
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5502.565,5511.475,"No, the company has a little short of cash so they go to the bank to raise the cash to pay off a very large claim at some catastrophe of some kind."
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5511.475,5514.23,"Your Honor, I don't believe that would constitute --"
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5514.23,5515.236,"Well, how's that different?"
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5515.236,5520.913,"Well, it does -- I believe that it would fall too far outside the relationship between the insurer and the insured."
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5522.697,5529.464,"What the insurance company needs to satisfy a claim that it's obligated and under the policy to satisfy, it's $10.00 rather than drugs."
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5530.53,5536.925,I don't believe it would fall within the criteria establish by this Court in SEC versus National Securities.
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5536.925,5539.799,The only criteria there is that it be the business of insurance.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5541.895,5542.973,"Well, Your Honor, this Court set out --"
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5542.973,5544.29,And if you buy the company.
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5544.29,5559.4,Set out some very broad criteria in determining what constitutes the business of insurance in that case but the real nexus for what does constitute the business of insurance are matters that intimately relate to the insurer-insured relationship.
1978.77-952,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5575.019,5581.367,Do you apply that all that language to make a big loan from a bank to pay-off a policy obligation it seems to me?
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5581.367,5604.39,"Your Honor, there was the preceding case in 1959 of Securities and Exchange Commissioner versus Variable Annuity said, that the merger of two insurance companies even though the sale of stock or the holding of stock involved the insureds to some respect said that that was not sufficient that did not sufficiently relate to the insurer-insured relationship."
1978.77-952,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5610.019,5619.719,"The real answer is, to my brother Stevens' question is that the further we take you away from this case and your theory of the less certain you get."
1978.77-952,3,33872,keith_e_kaiser,,5619.719,5621.935,Yes sir.
1978.77-952,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5622.414,5622.994,Thank you Mr. Kaiser.
