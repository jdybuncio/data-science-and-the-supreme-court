2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.256,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1603, Jeffrey A. Beard v. George E. Banks."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,75.38,77.731,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.014,239.097,"Mr. Eisenberg, tell... tell us exactly what you mean by jury unanimity because, you know, most States require jury unanimity in the... in the final verdict."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,239.097,240.212,"Excuse me, Your Honor, yes."
2003.02-1603,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.994,317.571,"On... on the instructions in the red brief at page 8 and then at page 9, there are two different instructions set out."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,341.802,350.819,"Your Honor, I think that the instruction here was basically the same throughout, that the message as to unanimity regarding mitigation or not was basically the same throughout the instructions."
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,441.62,456.564,"Well, with Lockett... with Lockett they... what Lockett says is that the sentencer cannot be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor any aspect of the defendant's character or record or any circumstance."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,511.549,512.003,Well--
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,512.003,515.225,"Well, what else could Lockett mean is my question."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,515.225,515.679,--Lockett... Lockett--
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.679,520.919,What else could Lockett mean that would make sense in the context of the death penalty?
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,523.231,524.224,"--Excuse me, Justice Breyer."
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,524.224,524.717,Yes.
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,524.717,534.544,"It... what it also could have made sense is that the jury as a whole in the historical manner of juries had to consider the evidence, and there's no doubt that it could have meant the interpretation that you suggest."
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,550.519,558.404,"No, it doesn't, but I want you to tell me precisely in a reasonable way... and I'm going to wonder if that's... if it is reasonable or not."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,579.005,579.171,Well--
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,579.171,584.828,"So... so you tell me... I understand the words, well, historical, et cetera, but I want to pin you down more than that."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,584.828,585.858,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,626.559,629.532,But I'm thinking of Penry's commentary about Mills or whatever.
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,636.84,638.26,"Your Honor, I--"
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,638.26,638.882,--from Lockett--
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,638.882,647.881,"--I could be wrong, but I... I remember no such statement from any of the opinions in Penry or really in any other case except for the... the Mills and McKoy cases where the subject was in dispute."
2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.808,665.092,"--Mr. Eisenberg, the court of appeals has changed its mind in this area, has it not?"
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,665.092,681.318,"That is certainly our view, Your Honor, and that is very relevant to the second question presented here, which is whether, even assuming that the Mills rule could be applied retroactively, there was a... an unreasonable application of that rule by the State court."
2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.796,732.626,Did it... did it treat the Frey case as overruling its earlier case?
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,732.626,742.74,"It's... it treated it as distinguishing, Your Honor, but that... Mr. Chief Justice, but we think that that's irrelevant for our purposes because the Frey case was a pre-AEDPA case, certainly wasn't applying a deference standard."
2003.02-1603,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.222,758.405,Could I interrupt?
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,758.405,758.777,--Excuse me.
2003.02-1603,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.777,760.057,May I interrupt with just one question?
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,788.293,792.751,"The court of appeals in the Zettlemoyer case, the first one in 1991, focused on both, Your Honor."
2003.02-1603,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.751,793.206,It did.
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,793.206,801.834,And the court of appeals... it was faced with the... the... I believe that the page exactly is 923 F. 2d at 308.
2003.02-1603,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.386,827.553,"Because the jury form does seem to imply a concept of unanimity because they got to require... you know, the form definitely refers to unanimity."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,827.553,842.906,"Well, the form refers to unanimity in exactly the same way that the charge does, I would submit, Justice Stevens, because it says, we, the jury, unanimously sentence the defendant in the above matter, and then you have two options, just as the statute in Pennsylvania and just as the judge's charge laid out."
2003.02-1603,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.151,877.048,"Yes, but... but the key point is that in the mitigating circumstances are, there are one, two, three options."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,877.913,878.944,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1603,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.773,901.318,"And see, it isn't explicit here, and the check seems to me to indicate that they were unanimous on mitigating circumstance number 1, but they were not on the others."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,901.318,901.773,Well--
2003.02-1603,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.773,909.574,And so it seems very likely that some of the jurors may have considered... felt they could not consider mitigating circumstance 2 or 3.
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,909.574,910.234,"--Your Honor, two things."
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.689,1028.976,"And so... so if in fact we have 12 jurors and all 12 believe that this person was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and 11 of them think that means he shouldn't get death, but one of them thinks it isn't that much of an offsetting factor, on your reading of this, the... they could conclude after Lockett that it's death because we don't have unanimity on whether that Congressional Medal offsets the horrible crime."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1028.976,1049.077,"--Justice Breyer, for purposes of the second question here, the deference question, our argument is that that is not the case, that the jury here was not permitted to vote for death or not required to vote for death automatically merely because they were not unanimous in failing to find a particular piece of mitigation."
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.077,1057.993,"So if they had been... because let's... I... I was reading the jury form differently, and I might be wrong."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1076.326,1084.499,"What I would say, Your Honor, is that before Mills a State that came to that conclusion would not have acted unreasonably for purposes of the Teague standard."
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1084.499,1084.665,"Yes, all right."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1139.856,1142.556,"Well, Your Honor, we think it is a significant change and that's--"
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1142.556,1145.628,But amazingly enough to fall within in... you see where I'm going?
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1145.628,1146.271,"--Well, that's--"
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.271,1148.09,I'm... I'm saying--
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1148.09,1148.628,--to the same exception.
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1148.628,1148.933,--a watershed rule.
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1150.048,1150.364,"Yes, yes."
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.479,1153.874,"If it is a watershed rule, then of course it's retroactive."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1153.874,1161.304,"--Then answer to that is, Your Honor, that the fact that a rule is new enough to be Teague-barred is hardly enough to make it... render it--"
2003.02-1603,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.304,1162.297,"In other words, it's not that--"
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1162.297,1162.752,--a second Teague exception.
2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1244.653,1245.767,--You mean that Teague is a new rule.
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1245.767,1246.676,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.669,1247.957,Mills is.
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1247.957,1248.495,Thank you.
2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1325.937,1333.944,"Just to get back a minute, Mr. Eisenberg, this case was decided before Mills was decided."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1334.194,1335.559,The direct appeal in this case--
2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1335.559,1336.218,"Yes, the direct appeal."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1336.218,1340.51,"--was completed, including denial of certiorari by this Court, before Mills was decided."
2003.02-1603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1375.683,1382.703,"But, Mr. Eisenberg, you would concede that those... those questions are... are certainly ambiguous."
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1407.262,1415.314,"Well, Your Honor, I would suggest that if it is susceptible to such a reading at all, it is far from the primary meaning, and the reason for that is really just the rules of English grammar."
2003.02-1603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1447.924,1465.468,"Mr. Eisenberg, if you... if you were... if you were a... a defense lawyer and you knew that the... the law was that each juror could individually decide the mitigators and you were confronted with a form like this, would you object?"
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1465.468,1470.465,"--Well, Your Honor, had the Mills rule already been decided, I think somebody might have raised an objection."
2003.02-1603,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1500.391,1507.904,"Before it was just the law and not constitutional, it was all right to be... to be ambiguous, but once it was constitutional, it had to be clear?"
2003.02-1603,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1508.647,1519.338,"Well, our... our argument, Your Honor, is that the fact that they changed the form in response to a new rule is not evidence that they previously read their statute in a different way."
2003.02-1603,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.582,1605.697,"Very well, Mr. Eisenberg."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,1608.835,1614.779,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1712.86,1734.88,"That might have been, Mr.... Mr. Flora, the logical extension of Lockett, but to say that Lockett itself compelled or directed that extension I think is quite a stretch."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,1734.88,1757.442,"Justice Ginsburg, I think when you look back at the legal landscape over a period of time, going back from Hitchcock, to Skipper, to Eddings, in all of those cases, the Court dealt with different types of barriers."
2003.02-1603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1830.548,1838.229,Does it... does it mean nothing that this Court was so sharply divided and that you really have just an opinion?
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,1853.765,1877.049,"If we look at Mills and if we look at the dissent, in looking at the dissent, my interpretation was that the issue was over how a reasonable juror would have interpreted the particular instructions in that case."
2003.02-1603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.749,1938.721,"Yes, but Lockett didn't put it quite that way, did it?"
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,1949.245,1950.238,That is correct.
2003.02-1603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.102,1974.774,It said that the... it said the court had to admit any evidence dealing with the defendant's character.
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,1974.774,1994.715,"That is correct, but what I'm saying is when you look back at Lockett, at the time Lockett was decided, I don't think the Court could... could envision the various types of barriers that a State could create which would preclude a sentencer from giving effect to mitigating evidence."
2003.02-1603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.03,2005.2,But what happened in Lockett was quite different than what was involved in Mills.
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2025.429,2046.521,"--The way I describe Mills is essentially again that in order to give effect to mitigating evidence, you simply cannot have a requirement which allows one juror to preclude the other 11 from giving that effect."
2003.02-1603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2054.284,2070.547,"If there's doubt about that, I mean, one might say you would prevail on that argument in a debate, but Teague requires more, doesn't it?"
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2070.547,2085.614,There is language as to whether if there is a reasonable debate amongst the minds of the jurors.
2003.02-1603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2137.505,2152.57,"Does it make any difference if it's four Justices, as it was in McKoy, do you think?"
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2152.57,2158.886,I don't think you can honestly quantitate it... put a quantitative amount to it.
2003.02-1603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.768,2175.4,Does it make any difference that the dissenters say Lockett didn't remotely support the rule that a mitigator found by only one juror controls?
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2175.4,2188.403,--I think... that's a tough question.
2003.02-1603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.403,2199.465,But that is what... what was said in McKoy by the dissenters.
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2199.465,2208.36,"That is what was said in McKoy by the dissenters, but the majority in McKoy disagreed with that."
2003.02-1603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2208.36,2226.752,"Would it be all right, let's say today after Mills, for a trial judge to instruct a jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is a case of utmost gravity from the standpoint of both the defendant and... and the families of the victims?"
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2249.088,2252.364,A judge could not say in light of Mills.
2003.02-1603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2255.154,2256.435,It's too dangerous?
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2256.435,2262.091,--especially in a weighing State because you're talking about unanimously find aggravating circumstances.
2003.02-1603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2283.267,2293.298,"Because it seems to me that what I've said is right, that if they are unanimous on all factors, that that's... that's the jury functioning at its best."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2305.724,2326.242,"If you tell the jury to try to unanimously find all of the mitigating factors, the problem I see with that is what happens if they don't."
2003.02-1603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2335.38,2341.679,"Well, of course, my hypothetical was half... half completed, and then we'd have to fill in what would happen and I... I didn't bother to do that."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2357.904,2364.841,It was an understanding of the way the jury functions pre-Mills.
2003.02-1603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2384.243,2389.073,"Well, I... I think for your case you... you have to amend your statement."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2405.503,2432.912,"--Well, when I think of a unanimity requirement in a non-capital setting, if one juror holds out, that juror cannot force a guilty verdict."
2003.02-1603,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.112,2464.081,"That's true, but now what are you... what do you say to a different reading of Lockett, which would be the following?"
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2545.694,2548.294,I think we can.
2003.02-1603,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.294,2549.796,Because?
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2549.796,2570.957,"I think we can because merely giving consideration to mitigating evidence would, I think, also necessitate the ability to give effect to that evidence, and I think that's what's essential."
2003.02-1603,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2575.044,2592.505,"But you... you don't seem to mention our holding in Saffle v. Parks which was a much harder, closer case in my view about whether it was dictated by Lockett than your case."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2603.445,2611.125,"--In Saffle, you were dealing with an anti-sympathy instruction."
2003.02-1603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2626.108,2629.452,Sympathy is a... a conflict?
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2629.452,2630.567,Is a concept.
2003.02-1603,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2630.567,2631.022,Concept.
2003.02-1603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2631.022,2631.272,"Oh, concept."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2631.848,2666.938,"When you introduce sympathy, as the attempt was to be done in Saffle, that by doing that you're bringing into the picture something that is totally irrelevant and from which a jury would not be able to make a reasoned moral inquiry into the culpability of the defendant to determine whether a sentence of death or life should be imposed."
2003.02-1603,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.291,2702.148,Is... is... the point I was thinking before and I'd... it was Justice Kennedy actually.
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2745.517,2758.504,It would be freakish or arbitrary again I think because mere consideration of evidence by a jury is not enough.
2003.02-1603,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2771.94,2774.191,"No, but the question is how you give it effect."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2843.748,2863.522,I think that it still comes back to how the unanimity requirement operates.
2003.02-1603,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2891.757,2900.673,Is... a different question.
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2942.534,2944.475,It's improperly indented.
2003.02-1603,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.645,2950.791,But the form itself is... it's indented.
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,2966.645,2975.106,"--When you have we, the jury, have found unanimously, my recollection of the form was that it is actually not indented like that."
2003.02-1603,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2975.106,2980.39,"If it's not indented, then... and this is the other part of the case."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,3036.162,3045.987,"My understanding of the verdict form when it was developed was that we, the jury, have found unanimously basically applies to all of the check-off items."
2003.02-1603,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3045.987,3046.442,All of those things.
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,3046.442,3047.268,I beg your pardon?
2003.02-1603,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3047.268,3054.205,"And... and if a judge... if a judge in the State says, well, I think it didn't, what would you point to in reply?"
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,3054.205,3057.754,The only thing that I could point to is the actual verdict form itself.
2003.02-1603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3222.297,3231.297,"But that was something in 1995, and you're talking now about a case that was over on direct appeal before Mills was decided."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,3231.297,3244.051,"--That is correct, but in 1995, when the case was decided, the Pennsylvania supreme court had the benefit of Mills."
2003.02-1603,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3299.407,3306.799,But wouldn't that undercut this Court's remand the first time around?
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,3317.323,3336.353,"And I understand that, and when you sent it back, one of the questions we had in our own mind is whether in fact this Court was fully aware of Pennsylvania's unique process dealing with finality in capital cases."
2003.02-1603,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3414.206,3421.06,"Yes, but that's the State making a policy that its State court judges will do that, and that's different from a Federal intrusion."
2003.02-1603,1,15932,albert_j_flora_jr,,3421.06,3430.432,I think the States have a right to do that.
2003.02-1603,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3433.032,3435.095,"I think you've answered it, Mr. Flora."
2003.02-1603,2,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3438.483,3440.795,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1603,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3612.814,3626.848,"See, this mixed question of fact of law that I think makes it more difficult for you in the sense that if it's a mixed question, it's really asking the jurors to decide should this person die, does he deserve to die."
2003.02-1603,2,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3637.334,3638.16,"--But, Your Honor, those--"
2003.02-1603,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3638.16,3638.82,And that... that--
2003.02-1603,2,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3638.82,3659.048,"--those difficult mixed questions are exactly the kinds of questions that we always ask juries to decide and in every context outside of this one, to decide unanimously, even for example, not just in the case of the commonwealth meeting its burden of proof, but the defendant meeting his burden of proof where that burden of proof is on him in the situation of a... of an affirmative defense."
2003.02-1603,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3668.875,3669.618,"Thank you, Mr. Eisenberg."
