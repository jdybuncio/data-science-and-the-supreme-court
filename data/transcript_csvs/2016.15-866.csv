2016.15-866,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.045,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-866, Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands. Mr. Bursch."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,7.045,16.13,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress did not intend to grant a century-long copyright monopoly in cheerleader uniform design."
2016.15-866,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,53.26,64.269,"Why, in this case, would we even need to get to any question of separability? What was submitted was a two-dimensional artwork."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,114.495,116.62,"There two reasons, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,204.95,206.65,But they have put it on those other items.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,257.11,266.58,"Let me respond to both of those points, that the obvious in the second; first, the other garments. To the extent they're putting it on other garments, if you look closely at those pictures, the design changes."
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,308.195,316.28,"How could you copyright anything under your use of ""utility,"" under your definition of ""utility""?"
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,316.28,317.44,Because my definition --
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,317.44,328.53,"Every form -- I suspect in most cases, every form gives something else, an attractiveness, to the purchaser."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,332.965,334.35,We completely agree.
2016.15-866,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,368.68,386.405,"Suppose you have a Picasso painting or Mondrian or Klee, and suppose they're alive and they licensed the use of their picture on a garment and it does just what you say: This Picasso painting or Mondrian just completely captures the shape of the article you want."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,390.685,392.43,"No, it does not, because the Picasso --"
2016.15-866,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,392.43,400.12,What's the difference between Mondrian or Picasso and these -- and these lines?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,400.12,410.61,"Because I could take the Picasso and I could just have it in a frame on the chest, or I could expand it to the entire breadth of the uniform. With these designs, it has -- the side lines have to be right here."
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,427.58,434.775,How is your argument different from this tuxedo shirt that the government talks about -- it's on page 10 of the government's brief --
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,434.775,435.155,Yes.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,435.155,450.415,"-- where the lines really do have to be just in a particular place on the piece of apparel in order for it to make any sense at all and, in there, that was found to be copyrightable? Is that -- is there -- there any difference between the tuxedo shirt and this?"
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,450.415,457.74,"Well, there are differences, and I think even the government would tell you, if you asked them that question, that that design wouldn't prevent you from making the tuxedo."
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,467.07,467.29,No.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,478.42,478.84,Right.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,479.5,482.15,-- with those particular lines in that particular place.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,482.15,485.73,The point is you can have a copyright in that design.
2016.15-866,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,502.52,514.54,So I guess I'm not sure about your -- does that mean if you can have a copyright in the tuxedo shirt design that somebody couldn't draw a tuxedo shirt because that's copyrighted two-dimensional?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,514.54,515.77,"Correct, right."
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,524.08,530.11,But you're saying you couldn't make the tuxedo shirt -- is that correct? -- or you could?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,530.11,530.95,You could not.
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,554.05,560.84,So are you suing them just for the pictures that are in their catalogue? Is that what you're suing them for?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,560.84,562.9,We're not suing them; they're suing us.
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,562.9,563.845,I'm sorry.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,574.18,574.66,No.
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,574.66,578.009,-- but you can't stop them from selling their --
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,578.009,587.05,"We can't stop them from using their copyright to do anything on a printed page, or even to take these designs and, like I said, put it on a lunchbox or a notebook."
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,588.89,590.85,I transposed the two of you.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,591.62,592.82,"No problem, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,592.82,599.53,Can -- are they stopping you from -- you think you can sell your uniforms anywhere.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,599.53,600.24,Correct.
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,600.24,621.87,"So what can't you do? If we don't agree with you, if we agree with them that this is a -- eligible for copyright absent some other disqualification, like obviousness or lack of creativity or whatever else, okay, assume we agree with them; what can they stop you from doing?"
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,621.87,628.945,"Well, actually, if you agree with them that they have a copyright, then you're agreeing with us, too, because we all agree they have a copyright in the sketch."
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,628.945,629.47,Okay.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,629.47,631.125,They have a copyright in the image.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,651.32,655.33,So but if I could just go back and make sure I understand my question about the tuxedo shirt.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,655.33,655.52,Yes.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,655.52,661.195,"If I have a copyright in the design of the tuxedo shirt, not in a tuxedo --"
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,661.195,661.7,Correct.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,661.7,669.07,"-- I have a copyright in the design of a tuxedo shirt, can I prevent other people from manufacturing tuxedo shirts?"
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,669.07,669.61,Yes.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,669.61,672.195,So why isn't that exactly the same?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,672.195,673.01,Because --
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,673.01,685.815,"Because here, I have a design in a copyright dress, and now I'm trying to prevent other people from manufacturing that cheerleader dress with that design."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,685.815,688.245,Because then that's like manufacturing the tuxedo.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,696.765,699.46,I don't understand why it's like manufacturing a tuxedo.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,715.96,721.79,It has to do with the very careful statutory requirement that they exist independently.
2016.15-866,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,750.06,753.38,Is that the same for all five of the --
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,753.38,754.22,All five.
2016.15-866,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,786.61,791.055,I thought conveying information doesn't make an article useful.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,791.055,795.055,I don't think that optical illusions are conveying information.
2016.15-866,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,798.12,805.425,"Well, you said -- you said a function of the cheerleader -- cheerleader's dress is to identify the person as a cheerleader."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,805.425,805.68,Yes.
2016.15-866,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,940.14,942.92,I thought that the -- the shape was the same on all of these.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,947.52,948.34,No.
2016.15-866,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1016.84,1021.835,"So do you get a different -- a different result if, instead of stitched, the design is applied?"
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1021.835,1036.21,"If it's -- it's subliminated, which is something that they -- they've talked about. It's no different with respect to the optical illusion or the identifying function, because if you print the same design in a cheerleader uniform, you'd have to print it exactly the same way they stitch it. Let's focus now on page 5."
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1050.6,1054.68,"Mr. Bursch, I go back to this point, because I'm a little confused."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1062.205,1063.14,Correct.
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1063.14,1067.28,What do they -- what do you think they have a copyright in?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1067.28,1068.61,They have a copyright --
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1068.61,1073.77,Or the -- what do you think is eligible for copyright in this picture?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1073.77,1088.11,"I think the copyright eligibility in this picture is the design, so long as it's not being used to prevent the manufacturer of the useful article that it was intended to be -- to appear on. Like I said, they --"
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1088.11,1090.22,Isn't that the government's position too?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1090.22,1092.72,"Well, I -- I think they agree with us on that point."
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1093.27,1093.56,On that point.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1093.56,1093.68,Yeah.
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1105.29,1120.495,"So what can't you do, assuming that you accept what they have a copyright in, sort of the -- this thing, but not in stopping the manufacture of the uniform --"
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1120.495,1120.91,Yes.
2016.15-866,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1120.91,1124.14,-- what do you think their copyright stops you from doing?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1124.14,1125.06,Everything else.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1153.59,1164.74,"Well, I guess that's the question, is it really in any way, because the opposite way of reading this statute is that the ""utilitarian aspects"" of the article that you're talking about in terms of the separability test?"
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1164.74,1165.36,Yes.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1165.36,1217.02,"That -- that those ""utilitarian aspects"" should be understood to encompass only the utilitarian functions that make something a useful article in the first place, which means that they should be held to exclude things that relate to the -- portraying the appearance of the article or things that relates to conveying information, and that seems to me a pretty good -- I mean, it's a confusing statute, but it seems to me a pretty good holistic understanding of this statute. But that is what this statute is trying to do, is to say there are certain kinds of things that might in a broad sense be considered utilitarian, which has to do with portraying appearance or conveying information, that, for this inquiry, we want you to exclude, that the separability test does not relate to those kinds of things."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1217.02,1231.26,"And, Justice Kagan, that would be a possible policy that Congress could have adopted, but that's not what the statute says. When you're applying the separability test, you're comparing the features to the ""utilitarian aspects"" of the article, not the intrinsic utilitarian function."
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1255.21,1270.72,But the reason why camouflage is such a good example for your side is that camouflage actually -- we can understand it as having a utilitarian function that is different from simply conveying information and it is different from simply making something appear a certain way.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1270.72,1270.86,Yeah.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1270.86,1275.11,"In other words, the utilitarian function that camouflage has is to hide you in the woods."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1275.11,1275.815,Yes.
2016.15-866,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1275.815,1280.445,And so -- so that function would not be excluded by these things.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1280.445,1289.365,"Right, but the utilitarian function of the fabric only works -- of the design only works in conjunction with the useful article, and the same is true here."
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1313.02,1318.185,Forget the special things. I have a picture of a dress now.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1326.36,1326.855,Yes.
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1326.855,1327.59,All right.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1361.695,1362.55,Exactly.
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.55,1363.2,That's it.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1363.2,1366.21,"That is the ""identified separately"" portion of our argument."
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1366.21,1366.76,That's your point.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1367.3,1368.19,That's one of two points.
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1368.19,1376.35,"And then if you fail on that, you have all the specialized arguments about special purposes of cheerleader costumes."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1376.35,1376.49,Right.
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1376.71,1378.96,But the basic argument is what I said; is that right?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1378.96,1379.53,"Well, the part of your --"
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1379.53,1380.45,Is that right?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1380.45,1389.52,"Yes, but the -- the part of your description that makes me nervous is when you talk about, I'm just imagining something, because that's the ""side-by-side"" test that Varsity advances."
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.12,1400.11,"Well, why not? It says, separable from, so we look to see if it's separable from."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1400.11,1401.08,"Right, but what they ignore --"
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.08,1402.285,What else do we have --
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1402.285,1403.14,But what they ignore --
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.14,1404.215,-- but our imagination?
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1404.215,1407.645,But what they ignore is that it has to be independent.
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1409.83,1410.11,All right.
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1410.34,1414.655,"-- of the ""utilitarian aspects."" And so -- so then you lose the utility."
2016.15-866,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1435.26,1436.085,"True, true."
2016.15-866,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1436.085,1446.65,"So you have to look not only at the design; you have to look at the article as well. And if the article does less work when that thing is gone, it's not separable."
2016.15-866,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1451.69,1461.595,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1461.595,1471.835,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress directed the copyright office and the courts to protect applied art as well as fine art. Applied art is art applied to a useful article."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.97,1516.38,What do you do about the camouflage case?
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1516.38,1521.77,We think that camouflage -- the idea of camouflage certainly can't be copyrighted under --
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.77,1522.2,"No, no, no."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1526.715,1530.03,"If it's a brand-new, original camouflage pattern --"
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.03,1531.06,Right.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1531.06,1536.79,"-- we think -- although, I don't think you need to agree with me about this in order to agree with Varsity in this case."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1543.77,1547.22,"Well, can it be -- can it be reproduced on a military uniform?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1547.22,1549.0,-- or -- a hunter's garment.
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.57,1585.42,"Well, if you take them off the useful article, you have whatever color the fabric is, a white dress."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1589.045,1595.645,"Well, respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, you can -- you can have a white cheerleading uniform worn by a cheerleader with the team name and team logo on it."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.42,1600.04,From the 1950s.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1600.04,1612.195,"Well, you could -- you could have -- you could have -- if you look at page 34 of the Joint Appendix, you'll see in Star's own catalogue examples of uniforms that have neither stripes nor chevrons nor color blocks."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.36,1638.125,Your friend on the other side concedes that those could be copyrighted.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1659.44,1668.68,"Well, let me resist the premise, of course, then, that this -- this particular design or these five particular designs and striped chevrons and color blocks are what make a cheerleading uniform a cheerleading uniform."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1701.88,1703.41,I think you're avoiding the question.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1726.905,1736.0,"Well, I guess I just have to resist the premise that these particular designs are what make a cheerleading uniform a cheerleading uniform."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.0,1741.58,But if you -- I understand you are resisting the premise as applied to your case.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1752.13,1759.785,I think that's exactly the kind of utility that Congress did not write into the statute. That -- that is not the kind of utilitarian function that Congress contemplated.
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1783.47,1785.28,"Well, the House report is not the law, right?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1785.28,1796.345,"To be sure -- we are not -- we are not saying that it is, but we are saying that if you look, it's perfectly consistent with our view of what a utilitarian aspect of a useful article is."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1812.98,1817.885,So you're saying that the cheerleading uniforms do not serve a utilitarian purpose?
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1817.885,1825.84,We are saying that they don't serve the utilitarian purpose -- that the purposes my friends attributes to them are not utilitarian aspects of the article under the statute.
2016.15-866,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1830.56,1852.01,"Does the university that contracts with you know that they have to buy their uniform for you -- from you for 99 years plus whatever? Every university that you sell these cheerleading uniforms to, do they know that under your copyright, they are stuck with you forever?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1852.01,1854.84,"No Justice Sotomayor, that's -- that's not the case."
2016.15-866,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1854.84,1872.495,"Why not? If you have a copyright on this design, and they have adopted their school colors, orange and black, and I presume some of these are cheerleading uniforms belonging to certain teams, they buy them and they put their names on them, correct?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1872.495,1873.27,Sure.
2016.15-866,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1875.23,1882.18,So why aren't they stuck with you being their only supplier of their school colors for the rest of their existence?
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1882.18,1893.435,"There are many, many, many variants available, both copyrighted and uncopyrighted, you know, variants, of cheerleading uniforms, that, you know, Varsity and its competitors can sell."
2016.15-866,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1897.21,1904.765,"So I'm right, once a school -- you design a uniform for a school, that's it, forever?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1904.765,1919.53,"Well, respectfully, Justice Sotomayor -- Justice Sotomayor, if we -- if we design this particular combination of elements and we do own the -- we do own a copyright in that combination, but we don't own the idea of an orange and black cheerleader uniform or a black and yellow cheerleader uniform."
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1919.53,1925.28,"But the point, the question is, I think, if I -- because I have exactly the same question."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1986.15,1991.72,"Absolutely, Justice Breyer, because, you know, Justice Sotomayor's question was about the particular patterns."
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.72,1995.58,"And mine is about all dresses, all clothes, that's all suits."
2016.15-866,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1995.58,2000.64,You're killing -- you're killing knock-offs with -- with copyright.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2014.355,2022.68,"So let me clarify at the -- at the outset, we are not claiming the shape, the cut, or anything like that about -- about these garments."
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.55,2045.77,"Well, I see it here, and as I look at it and cut away the wings, I have left -- this is page 22 of the ASG's brief -- what I have left is, I have left the design you're after."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2064.18,2065.48,"Absolutely not, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.48,2065.72,It's not.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2072.155,2085.56,"Our design in figure eight, if you look at the registration that corresponds to that figure, which you will find in the Joint Appendix at G 46, you will see that the registration is for two-dimensional art work."
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.56,2086.275,Of course.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2096.385,2099.31,"No, but it's the two-dimensional artwork that appears on this surface."
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.22,2106.08,You didn't say you own the dress.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2106.08,2106.31,Correct.
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2106.31,2110.31,What you said is you own the design of the dress.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2110.31,2110.54,No.
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2110.54,2112.15,I -- now isn't -- you don't?
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2112.15,2112.545,No.
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2122.54,2123.16,"Mr. Jay, see --"
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2123.16,2123.92,"Now, wait."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2181.31,2190.58,"No, absolutely not, because the ability to take the shovel and hang it on the wall does not make the shovel a sculpture because the things that make the ""utilitarian aspect"" --"
2016.15-866,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2190.58,2192.975,I'm not talking about the shovel at the moment.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2224.68,2230.91,"Only in the surface design, not the folds, not the pleats, not the shape, not the cut. And my friend agreed with me --"
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2230.91,2231.41,"Mr. Jay, can I --"
2016.15-866,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2231.41,2234.805,"As to the -- as to the surface design, I have a similar question."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2247.19,2250.79,"You know, if they are original and meet the other requisites, one assumes so, yes."
2016.15-866,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2250.79,2257.535,"And so the design on any fabric, potentially, could be copyrighted, could it not?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2257.535,2258.96,The surface --
2016.15-866,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2258.96,2261.24,If it began as a painting?
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2261.24,2271.175,"The owner of the copyright in that painting has the right to reproduce it on fabric, on other textiles, you know, or you know, on a -- on a tapestry, on a rug or on wallpaper."
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2271.69,2280.52,"And isn't it -- just starting from the premise that Justice Alito suggested, the -- fabric designs are copyrightable; is that correct?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2280.52,2282.1,That's what -- that's what I was trying to say to Justice Breyer --
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2282.1,2282.77,Everybody agrees with that.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2282.77,2284.55,My friend agreed that the fabric design is copyrightable.
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2284.55,2293.885,"So it seems to me that the question, right, in this case, is are you going to treat this kind of design just as you would a fabric design?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2293.885,2294.34,That's right.
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2294.34,2308.27,"And as I understand Mr. Bursch's point, what Mr. Bursch is saying is, no, you shouldn't, because this kind of design has -- it -- it follows the figure of a human body, essentially."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2336.43,2347.88,"It doesn't make a difference because what he -- he has identified a number of different supposed ""utilitarian aspects,"" and some of which, I think, actually go to the fabric of the dress and were not -- or the uniform."
2016.15-866,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2385.69,2392.61,What is the difference between that utilitarian argument and the utilitarian argument as applied to camouflage?
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2392.61,2426.23,"The utilitarian argument as applied to camouflage is that it's -- I mean, as I said to the Chief Justice, we do think that if you see camouflage as portraying the appearance of a -- you know, of a particular thing, you know, or -- or sending a message that you belong in -- in a particular group, that would not be copyright-eligible -- sorry -- that -- that would not be a ""utilitarian aspect."" If camouflage is not copyright-eligible, it's because it performs something that's different from making you look good in a -- in an anesthetic way."
2016.15-866,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2429.93,2431.88,But why -- why should that make a difference?
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2431.88,2438.16,"I mean, the word ""utilitarian"" is the key word in the definition."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2488.68,2501.94,"Your -- the argument is not that it makes the room or whatever look better. The argument here is the design makes this look like a cheerleader uniform, which is different and distinctive function in -- than a normal dress."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2501.94,2502.1,Well --
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2502.1,2503.63,It's not simply to cover the body.
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2509.65,2520.895,"Well -- well, if that were true, Mr. Chief Justice, they'd have a decent argument under the merger doctrine if there were -- if there were only a few ways of expressing that you are a cheerleader and that you are wearing a cheerleader uniform."
2016.15-866,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.03,2566.14,"Under your -- under your argument, and as you best understand your colleagues' argument, to what extent are there findings of fact involved here? I mean, are we the ones that decide this? You wanted to introduce expert testimony. What was the expert testimony you wanted to introduce?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2566.14,2568.84,"The other side wanted to introduce expert testimony, Your Honor."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2587.73,2588.47,"Well, you just said that."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2605.02,2617.79,"Well, ultimately, the question is -- the question is the hypothetical question whether this design can -- can be identified separately from the articles on which it appears and whether it has -- it has an existence separate from those articles. And I think --"
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2617.79,2619.89,"And when you say ""this design"" -- I'm sorry, Mr. Jay."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2619.89,2620.51,"No, Your Honor --"
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2620.51,2641.865,"When you say ""this design,"" just to make sure I understand what you're claiming copyright in, so if I'm looking at page 4 and there's this design with a blue stripe and a white stripe and a red stripe and a white stripe and a blue stripe, could somebody else come along and just add another red stripe to that? And would that -- would you then say you violated our copyright?"
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2641.865,2645.03,Our copyright is in the arrangement of the design elements.
2016.15-866,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2645.03,2649.355,"The particular arrangement. So if somebody just added a different, another stripe."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2649.355,2658.73,"Well, adding another stripe is -- I -- I hesitate to agree with because usually reproducing a copyrighted work and then adding some other stuff around it is not enough to avoid infringement."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2664.975,2666.295,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-866,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2666.295,2676.354,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-866,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2676.354,2677.935,Mr. Feigin.
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2677.935,2685.85,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about the reproduction of two-dimensional artwork on a useful article."
2016.15-866,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2698.545,2701.425,Or putting camouflage on a military uniform?
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2701.425,2705.8,"So, Your Honor, camouflage has been protected by copyright for decades."
2016.15-866,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2724.17,2726.565,As applied to a military uniform.
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2726.565,2750.05,"So as applied to a military uniform, if someone were asserting a copyright in camouflage in such a manner as to prevent the manufacturer of a uniform from actually manufacturing a uniform that would perform a concealment function, and if concealment were, as Justice Kagan was positing, considered to be separate from the sorts of expressive functions that are traditionally protective by copyright --"
2016.15-866,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2750.05,2750.32,All of which --
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2750.32,2751.31,-- then there might infringement --
2016.15-866,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2751.31,2752.36,-- suggest the answer was yes; right?
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2752.36,2763.94,"Then there might be some infringement defenses that would apply in that context. But what I think the dispute in this case is really boiling down to is a question of what the utilitarian aspects of the ""useful article"" are."
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2777.72,2794.79,"What about the woman or the man who wishes -- and, indeed, this is a normal reason for wearing clothes -- they are making a statement about themselves? They're saying who they are? The clothes on the hanger do nothing; the clothes on the woman do everything."
2016.15-866,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2797.855,2798.85,That's so romantic.
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.85,2799.84,It always has been in history.
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2802.16,2803.0,"Well, Your Honor, it is --"
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2803.0,2804.635,Why do we wear robes?
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2804.635,2813.05,"Your Honor, it is clear and it is common ground among the parties and with the Copyright Office that the actual cut and shape of a garment isn't copyrightable."
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.05,2813.49,What about Lemley's --
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2813.49,2814.17,What we're here about --
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2814.17,2852.295,"What about Lemley's test on page 17 of his brief? As I -- as I read it, as I read it and I thought -- and I'm sure you've read it -- and it seemed to me that it does say that a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional piece of clothing is not entitled to copyright because it is not a design of anything but a utilitarian object, the clothes, whether they are beautiful clothes, ugly clothes, cheerleader, or anything else."
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2852.295,2860.7,"Well, Your Honor, I think I -- we disagree that you can't take the aesthetic aspects of the cheerleading uniform and put them in a different medium."
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2860.7,2865.24,"But do you agree with Lemley's statement, which, I mean, it's such an -- all the professors are there --"
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2865.24,2865.3,No.
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.79,2868.015,-- and that's why I thought probably you've read it.
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2872.655,2875.88,"Your Honor, as you've characterized the statement, we don't agree with it."
2016.15-866,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2943.16,2948.98,"Well, what do you do in Mr. Bursch's examples of military uniforms or police officer uniforms, something like that?"
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2948.98,2952.02,"So, Your Honor, those also are conveying information."
2016.15-866,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2990.02,2996.18,What about the Galiano case? That was the casino uniform.
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2999.36,3003.04,"Well, Your Honor, we -- we don't agree with the result in the Galiano case."
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3018.09,3021.57,"Well, before you get away from that, one thing very quick, because maybe I really agree with you."
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3021.57,3022.74,I hope so.
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3022.74,3026.81,I had looked at page 22 of your brief at figure 8.
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3045.58,3054.62,"The point of figure 7 and 8 in our brief, Your Honor, is that everything you see in figure 7 that's also in figure 8 is not copyrightable. That's the cut and shape of the dress."
2016.15-866,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3059.99,3074.73,"So what happens if when you look at the picture that they submit to the Copyright Office and try to figure out if it's separable what you see is a picture of a dress that goes around a woman which does look like, you know, shape and cut and so forth?"
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3074.73,3110.68,"So they have generally checked a box, as they did here, that says two-dimensional artwork, and the Copyright Office understands all they're trying to protect is the surface imagery of the garment, and that, they'll register. I do want to address this idea that making the viewer look different is somehow the kind of non-expressive function that is associated with the ""useful article"" -- with a ""useful article."" And I think that approach would be contrary to congressional intent and completely inadministrable. If you look at page 55 of the House report, you'll see that Congress believed that two-dimensional designs on fabric or on wallpaper would be separable and thus copyrightable."
2016.15-866,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3128.53,3140.745,"Well, that seems a problem. But on the other hand, it seems a little bit strange that, you know, take a garment designer who wants to do a design that is slimming."
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3147.82,3148.13,Correct.
2016.15-866,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3148.13,3166.335,"Then you're saying that the -- that the placement of stripes or color, that is copyrightable, even though the garment designer is really trying to do the same thing through color and through graphic design as he was doing through the shape of the article."
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3166.335,3179.27,"So, Your Honor, I definitely think there is a spectrum here, but let me try to explain why I think this is on the expressive side of the line, not the non-expressive side of the line. If I were to wear a shirt that said ""Please focus on my very nicely toned arms."
2016.15-866,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3213.25,3219.44,Is the domain of copyright to copyright the way people present themselves to the world?
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3219.44,3234.26,"The way that someone expresses -- the way that someone expresses an idea to the world -- in this case, the idea would be how they look -- is something that is very akin to traditional expression that's protected by copyright. Again, here we're just talking about two-dimensional artwork."
2016.15-866,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3247.15,3250.725,The whole point of the case is we're not just talking about two-dimensional artwork.
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3276.255,3281.4,"Your Honor, I think our fundamental disagreement is whether this is actually performing utilitarian functions."
2016.15-866,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3281.92,3282.12,Sure.
2016.15-866,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3282.12,3299.66,"-- finish my response. And I think one -- I think one problem with the approach you've just articulated is it really divorces Section 101 and 113(a) because you could get a copyright in the illustration, and then he would say it's not copyrightable in certain applications, and that doesn't make much sense. Thank you."
2016.15-866,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3299.66,3304.584,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch, six minutes."
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3304.584,3316.69,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to start with that final point that the government makes, that if you had a statement that says look at my arms on your shirt that somehow that would be conveying the same message."
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3348.295,3349.08,But the colors do.
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3363.205,3365.19,"Well, they are not claiming copyright in the colors."
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3365.97,3366.61,"No, they are not."
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3366.61,3377.79,"-- the arrangement. And I would say even as to color, this Court in the Qualitex case, that was a trademark case, you said that black, the color black has the ability to make a motor look smaller than it actually is."
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3386.145,3395.03,"Before we are going much further, you're now saying that any -- you're saying there is no copyright on those things."
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3395.03,3395.33,"Oh, no."
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3395.87,3398.77,On those pictorial representations --
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3398.77,3398.99,Yes.
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3398.99,3403.965,-- because they can always be applied in a way that has a function.
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3403.965,3431.96,"That -- that's not correct, because if you took the sports logo that the government mentioned, that's a perfect example of something that doesn't require the garment for its functionality, because, just like we were discussing earlier, you could take the logo, and you could put it on your hat or your socks or your lunch pail or on your -- your mitten that you hold up when the folks hit the home run, right, because it doesn't rely at all for the article on which it's appeared for its functionality. But here, these designs rely entirely --"
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3431.96,3433.875,Certain kinds make you look fatter --
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3433.875,3434.38,Right.
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3434.93,3435.865,You believe that --
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3435.865,3436.59,And if --
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3436.59,3446.75,"So you're saying none -- even if you find a color rainbow of some weird ilk that could never be copyrighted, because --"
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3446.75,3457.79,"They -- they could have the copyright in the two-dimensional design, but if there was an application where it would create functionality when paired with a garment, then, yes, their copyright would not extend to prevent --"
2016.15-866,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3457.79,3462.94,"How about the gorilla, a gorilla's hand around your -- one of the pictures in --"
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3462.94,3463.2,Right.
2016.15-866,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3531.4,3562.715,"How do we decide that it's -- how do we decide that it's the design that makes it what it is, as opposed to the cut of the garment, the shape, the pleats or whatever, the tightness of the top? What -- why should we say that -- that this two-dimensional design, which could be put on many things, is what makes this article utilitarian? But what do you do about the shape?"
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3562.715,3566.13,"Well, here it's more than just the shape."
2016.15-866,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3567.63,3575.45,"But we -- everybody agrees that the shape, the cut of the dress, that the garment itself is not copyrightable, right?"
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3575.45,3575.78,Correct.
2016.15-866,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3576.72,3581.855,So we are talking about the -- the design.
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3581.855,3582.535,Yes.
2016.15-866,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3582.535,3591.98,So why -- why is this close to a fabric design?
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3591.98,3597.575,"Because, again, the fabric designs work anywhere, anyplace, no matter how you move them."
2016.15-866,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3649.945,3663.38,"Well, can't the school just go to somebody who puts the zigzag where the chevron was, or the chevron where the zigzag was, or makes it a couple of different colors or adds another stripe? I mean, there's this -- my clerk found -- I'm sorry."
2016.15-866,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3664.51,3665.545,"No, you can --"
2016.15-866,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3665.545,3666.63,I'm done with my question.
2016.15-866,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3666.63,3684.22,"Yeah, as my -- as my friend on the other side said, it -- it would still be a copyright problem because they would claim that it was too close to the original. And you can see from the last two pictures that we have in our reply brief, that there are only certain places that these stripes and chevrons and color blocks can go, otherwise it doesn't look like a cheerleader uniform anymore."
2016.15-866,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3695.97,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
