2009.08-472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.245,"We will hear argument first today in Case 08-472, Salazar v. Buono."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,6.684,12.151,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,52.9,67.426,"General Kagan, just as a factual matter, is there any other national memorial that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol and no other?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,67.426,69.895,"--I don't believe that there is, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.031,127.058,"Well, I was just curious as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if there was any other memorial like that, and your answer is no, but there could be other religiously oriented memorials?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,127.058,134.272,"--Yes, and there is at least one religiously oriented memorial that I know of, which is a priest holding a cross."
2009.08-472,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,134.272,139.272,What are the practical consequences of something being designated as a national memorial?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,139.272,141.787,"Very little, Justice Alito."
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,163.058,176.27,Is the -- is the private property owner who has this designation free to destroy it after it's been designated a national memorial?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,176.27,178.146,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.674,191.793,Could they then substitute whatever other memorial they chose?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,191.793,192.624,The--
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,192.624,194.902,Or would there have to be some government approval?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,194.902,195.51,"--No, no, no."
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,209.708,224.904,"But it wouldn't automatically require acquire a national memorial status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it, hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial status, the government has to approve what you put up."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,224.904,226.09,"Yes, that's correct."
2009.08-472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.267,291.653,"General Kagan, before you go -- go on with your argument, you presented it as -- as though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of the land."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,318.096,328.731,"--Well, there is a question in this case whether the prior injunction was valid and was the display itself a violation of the Establishment Clause."
2009.08-472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.731,329.011,Right.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,329.011,337.493,But the government argued below that that question had been mooted out because of the passage of the transfer legislation.
2009.08-472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.493,339.118,But didn't the court of appeals say no?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,339.118,341.586,"The court of appeals did say no, but it remands the government--"
2009.08-472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.586,351.659,"So -- so what we have before us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the prior injunction, which applied to a cross on public land."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,351.659,371.278,"--Well, I think what you have before you, there were of course two stages in this litigation, and the first stage declared the display unconstitutional, and then the second stage declared the transfer as well unconstitutional or at least a violation of the prior injunction."
2009.08-472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.278,376.994,"Of course, if I -- if I thought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the transfer would a fortiori not--"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,376.994,378.32,"Well, that is correct."
2009.08-472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,407.902,410.23,I don't see why that's the issue before us.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,520.766,526.872,"--Justice Breyer, I think we are in perfect compliance with the injunction and have been since the day it was issued."
2009.08-472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,576.424,578.362,But that's not what I'm talking about.
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,578.362,581.517,I thought the Respondents asked to have the injunction enforced.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,635.587,638.445,"Justice Ginsburg, this is much more than an enforcement action."
2009.08-472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,638.445,639.381,We are talking about the first.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,651.907,652.363,That is correct.
2009.08-472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,652.363,669.416,"But what the plaintiff here said is that when you comply with this statute, you will not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted it to be displayed."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,676.836,694.439,"Justice Breyer, again, the Respondents had to go back to the district court in order not just to enforce the injunction, which said don't display the statue, but to get additional relief, which was don't transfer the statue."
2009.08-472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.214,715.757,--It seems to me unreasonable to read the injunction to say the government shall not permit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter who owns the land.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,723.942,732.175,"And the Ninth Circuit specifically said -- when this came to the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit was asked by the Respondents."
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.704,802.611,"Do you know, General Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible, where -- and standing was in question, raised, litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won the injunction comes to the court and says, court, please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we can go back to square one and argue again about standing?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,808.78,822.09,"Well, either this is one litigation, in which all cases are before the Court, or it's too entirely separate litigations, in which case the Court has an obligation to independently consider the standing question."
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,822.09,825.821,"Well, we know it isn't that because, as I think you pointed out, the same docket number."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,830.681,845.486,"It couldn't have been a motion to enforce the judgment because the government was in compliance with the judgment and because the Ninth Circuit had said that the question that respondents were raising was an entirely separate issue for another day, according to the Ninth Circuit."
2009.08-472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,845.486,851.609,"I would suppose -- I guess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the same action or it's entirely separate."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,886.002,897.919,"Mr. Chief Justice, we could not have taken the standing question to this Court in the -- in the procedural posture that the case was at at that point."
2009.08-472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,923.781,925.827,I don't understand -- I don't understand that point at all.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,958.409,977.824,"I think, Justice Sotomayor, you are right that we could have, but I don't think that we would have used our discretion, in a sense knocking on this Court's door, the Solicitor General's Office discretion, in order to ask you to decide a question that was as likely or not going to be completely irrelevant depending on what happened with respect to the transfer statute."
2009.08-472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,977.824,985.896,But interlocutory appeal or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to get away from the injunction.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1023.523,1031.738,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I appreciate the distinction that you are making between the standing question and the merits question and I think you are exactly right as to that point."
2009.08-472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.848,1073.971,"Well, but that -- that's because -- that's because you assume the act is going to be valid."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1088.199,1098.947,"Well, but we didn't, because we did think that Congress had acted appropriately and that the congressional act was valid, and continue to do so, continue to think that this--"
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1098.947,1121.466,"Yes, but the standing issue was independently important to the government, because the government can face this kind of question again, and if you right -- if you were right on the standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the government would not have had a strong incentive to say, we want to get rid of these cases on the standing ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing."
2009.08-472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1145.862,1148.565,But just I want to just get this clear procedurally.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1191.081,1191.393,--Justice Breyer.
2009.08-472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.393,1196.939,"--this violates the injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1216.069,1231.812,"You -- you are incorrect, Justice Breyer, because in addition to saying this violates the previously given injunction, the district court said, you are enjoined from transferring this property in accordance with this statute."
2009.08-472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.478,1248.774,Thank you.
2009.08-472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1248.774,1256.21,"Before we get -- before your time expires, we would like to spend a couple of minutes on the merits."
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1270.689,1280.825,"Mr. Chief Justice, there are certainly limits to the way that the government can transfer property, and I would give you a few of them."
2009.08-472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1307.388,1308.936,"Well, why isn't that -- why isn't that the case here?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1308.936,1310.968,"--In fact, it's not the case here."
2009.08-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.741,1328.976,But what percentage of the total area do they represent?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1328.976,1329.646,I'm sorry?
2009.08-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.646,1332.286,What percentage of the total area do they represent?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1332.286,1339.941,"It's about -- between the State and the private inholdings, it's about 10 percent of the total area."
2009.08-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.484,1352.295,But do you concede there was a violation at the time the case was decided?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1352.295,1353.387,--I'm sorry?
2009.08-472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.387,1358.105,Do you concede that the Establishment Clause was violated at the time this case was decided?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1358.105,1359.618,"We do not, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1396.325,1404.709,"Well, isn't that an interference or it's singling out someone, private property owner, who's using his property in a particular way, a religious way?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1409.115,1411.942,"I don't think that that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1421.391,1423.032,But it hasn't done anything like that.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1440.054,1447.131,"--Well, I suspect that there are a great many identification signs throughout the preserve, although I don't know precisely what they are."
2009.08-472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1458.72,1459.641,"--Who would see it, General Kagan?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1484.615,1488.848,"I actually think, Justice Ginsburg, that it would be easy to do."
2009.08-472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1509.933,1519.225,"How is the question of -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but briefly, how is the question of whether signs are or aren't valid or required before us in this case?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1523.897,1529.344,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that if we were not going to put up signs, it would still be valid."
2009.08-472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1559.382,1570.125,"Isn't there legislation that requires the original plaque to be reinstated, the plaque recognizing the donation and what it means?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1570.125,1571.611,"--That's correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1591.398,1593.881,"This would be on government land, that sign?"
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1598.974,1600.366,--The small plaque.
2009.08-472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1600.366,1600.709,You are talking about putting--
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1600.709,1602.316,The small plaque--
2009.08-472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1602.316,1603.364,--Would go on the cross?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1603.364,1604.503,--That's correct.
2009.08-472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1604.503,1610.891,The larger sign you're talking about that you are willing to do is a sign that you would put on government land.
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1610.891,1611.328,That's correct.
2009.08-472,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1619.778,1624.789,Did you raise that alternative with the Ninth -- with the district court and the Ninth Circuit?
2009.08-472,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1624.789,1628.022,"--I don't believe it ever came up, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-472,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.333,1637.521,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1641.861,1644.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1673.458,1675.065,I see what the judge did.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1704.147,1705.364,That's exactly correct.
2009.08-472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1705.364,1709.084,So that's the issue here that we were just possibly debating.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1725.215,1729.185,I believe that's -- that is here and that is really the only question that is here.
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1729.185,1742.226,"So that under your approach that this is looking to see if the injunction is being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an act of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard, not -- not de novo?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1742.226,1743.38,That's correct.
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1743.915,1745.319,Have we ever done that before?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1745.319,1745.787,--I--
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1745.787,1752.158,Have we ever said that an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a de novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1752.158,1761.139,"--I am not aware of that, but I am also not aware of a situation where the act of Congress is being put forth as the response to an already adjudicated constitutional violation."
2009.08-472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1761.139,1778.507,"Mr. Eliasberg, I thought that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the validity of the statute would not be before the Court in the first round."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1822.052,1832.936,"The only thing I would disagree with you on that point, Justice Ginsburg, is that the question is whether the act of Congress remedies the already adjudicated constitutional violation and is consistent with the injunction."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.936,1841.573,So when you get to the consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it was your position that we should review this question solely under an abuse of discretion standard?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1841.573,1842.747,It is our position--
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.747,1849.353,"Because while the Court did not decide the validity of the act in the first case, it certainly did in the second case, which is why we have the case before us."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1849.353,1850.226,--That is correct.
2009.08-472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1916.218,1922.34,When this injunction was first entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that this statute was going to be enacted; isn't that correct?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1922.34,1925.182,"--When the district court entered the injunction, that is correct."
2009.08-472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1925.182,1925.525,Yes.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1941.533,1946.485,"I don't believe so, Justice Scalia -- excuse me -- Justice Alito, for a couple of reasons."
2009.08-472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1958.746,1963.683,Wasn't your argument that this was a violation of the Establishment Clause because it was on government land?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1971.848,1975.349,We did not make that argument because it wasn't presented to the Court.
2009.08-472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1975.349,1990.375,"Yes, it was a totally -- so the situation completely changed and the district court either modified the injunction -- it seems to me modified the injunction by interpreting it to mean something quite different from what anybody contemplated it meant when it was originally entered?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,1990.375,1999.122,"Well, I think that, as is traditional equity principles, the district court is at some level the master of its injunction and that's why we give an abuse of discretion standard."
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.741,2019.504,"Well, of course, it was that, but the question is whether it was a permissible amendment by the government of the situation."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2032.404,2034.26,"--Well, I think it is--"
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.26,2041.898,--Unless the injunction clearly applied to the erection of a cross on private land that the government had -- had transferred.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2041.898,2044.102,"--Well, but it's not the erection of the cross."
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.078,2069.34,I will -- I will concede that the obvious purpose of that was to avoid being in violation of the injunction.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2071.591,2079.912,"--Well, I believe it's invalid because I think that the affirmative steps they are taking here really make them -- put them in a position where they are permitting--"
2009.08-472,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2079.912,2083.726,"Can -- can -- what, what -- let's start from the beginning."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2098.938,2100.28,"--No, they would not."
2009.08-472,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2100.28,2101.219,All right.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2120.07,2121.898,That is one part of my argument.
2009.08-472,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2137.625,2151.371,"So are you alleging that doing that violates the Establishment Clause, passing or designating a religious symbol as a national memorial, that that violates the Establishment Clause?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2151.371,2172.377,"--We are alleging that under the totality of the circumstances, which includes the national memorial designation, the government's asserted purpose to make sure that the cross remains up, the government's favoritism of the same parties that it has always favored in this case to the exclusion of others, and the maintaining of the property interest in the land in the form of a reversionary interest, all of those things--"
2009.08-472,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2172.377,2175.72,Does that apply to all lands in this preserve?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2175.72,2178.094,"--I'm sorry, does what apply to all lands?"
2009.08-472,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2178.094,2182.497,Does the reversionary interest apply to all of lands on this preserve?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2188.603,2192.963,"No, the reversionary interest specifically says the land reverts to the government if--"
2009.08-472,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2192.963,2193.524,"No, no, no."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2202.1,2204.019,--I don't believe that that is true.
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2204.019,2219.889,"Counsel, if -- if -- if the government sold this land to a private party, no cross in the picture at all, and they go to settlement and at settlement the private landowner who is going to buy it says, you know, I'm going to put a big cross up on this property once I get it, can the government still sell it to him?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2219.889,2221.714,"Yes, absolutely."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2221.714,2221.855,Okay.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2221.855,2227.025,If the basis for the government's decision to sell the -- sell the land was a neutral basis.
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2229.712,2239.489,"So even though before the sale, even though the government knows there is going to be a big cross on the land with the same situation you have here in the middle of the preserve and all, that's perfectly okay?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2239.489,2240.926,"--No, it's--"
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2240.926,2247.533,I thought you said before the government sold the land if they find out the new owner is going to put a cross on it there is no problem.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2247.533,2252.232,"--The difference between those two scenarios, Mr. Chief Justice, is one is a remedial context."
2009.08-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.665,2281.205,But isn't it also a very different case if a condition of the transfer is that the transferee will preserve a memorial that has been designated in the statute as a five-foot-tall white cross.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2281.205,2281.926,I think that is--
2009.08-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.926,2283.314,So it is a condition of the transfer.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2283.314,2291.188,"--As I was stating to Justice Sotomayor, that is one of the factors that we believe separates this situation from the kind of hypotheticals that you're setting forth."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2291.188,2296.246,"Do you disagree with what she told us, which is that the private property owner can tear down the cross at any time?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2296.246,2299.806,I think that there are very significant obstacles to their doing that.
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2338.902,2340.965,You say under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2344.479,2345.165,--That's correct.
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2350.211,2353.491,"Well, I suppose they have jurisdiction to regulate a lot of -- lot of land that they don't own."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2353.491,2367.595,"--Well I think that in this case when the government is actually -- there's quite a bit of case law -- we set forth some in our brief -- where they talk about the government's power over land that's within a national preserve, so I do think that the criminal statutes may very well apply."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2388.336,2389.85,What else -- what else does the plaque say.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2389.85,2393.238,"--The plaque says: ""This cross"" -- in big letters --"
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2397.567,2398.05,And that's it?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2398.768,2399.517,--Nothing else.
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.041,2421.322,The cross doesn't honor non-Christians who fought in the war?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2422.554,2423.662,--I believe that's actually correct.
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2423.662,2424.446,--Where does it say that?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2424.446,2436.971,"It doesn't say that, but a cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that's why the Jewish war veterans--"
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.971,2439.768,It's erected as a war memorial.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2468.459,2470.986,"--Well, Justice Scalia, if I may go to your first point."
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.453,2491.809,I don't think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2493.603,2501.804,"Well, my -- the point of my -- point here is to say that there is a reason the Jewish war veterans came in and said we don't feel honored by this cross."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2504.756,2506.226,Can I get back to your plaque question?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2521.392,2524.012,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and I apologize."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2524.92,2525.684,That's a big difference.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2538.694,2544.804,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the context of your question was would VFW feel constrained to keep the cross up?"
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2545.615,2548.786,The context of my question was what does the plaque say?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2548.786,2558.265,"--Well -- I -- I apologize for not giving the full text, that was not my intention to -- to mislead the Court or to you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2558.265,2558.858,All right.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2558.858,2569.152,"My only point is that in that scenario, because did I believe we were talking about, is the VFW free to do this, and I was pointing to the criminal statute that I said I believe said that they couldn't -- wouldn't feel free to take this down."
2009.08-472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2575.508,2597.783,"When the Solicitor General represents to us that the VFW will be perfectly free to modify this memorial in any way it chooses if they obtain title to this land, do you think that there's any realistic fear that they will be required to maintain this cross, even if they wish to -- to change it in some way?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2597.783,2608.666,"--Well, I think that there is a real -- well, but -- but I don't think that the cases turn on whether a prosecutor says well, I promise you that we are not going to enforce the statute."
2009.08-472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2621.114,2632.532,"Well, I thought your argument was that although there was going to be a formal transfer of title, as a practical matter, the government was still involved with the maintenance of the cross on this land."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2638.123,2647.354,"--Well, that -- the -- the question of government -- continued government involvement with the land, I believe, continues, because of the reversionary interest and because of the designation as a national memorial."
2009.08-472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2648.043,2661.364,"I think -- I think General Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't substitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a national monument it has to have the government's approval."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2664.799,2666.285,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2668.644,2676.389,"Well, I -- I thought the government's position was it had to be maintained as a national war -- as a war memorial, but not that it had to be maintained as a cross."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2676.389,2678.312,--That is the government's position.
2009.08-472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.177,2717.592,"What about the government's argument that suppose the government took down the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal value, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was ours to begin with."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2746.517,2754.235,"I believe that that -- obviously not the facts presented by our case, Justice Ginsburg, but that likely would be consistent with the injunction, that's correct."
2009.08-472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2756.107,2761.543,Then we are talking about something that is rather formal rather than substantial.
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2779.862,2789.248,"Well, I think if there -- if there were -- I think it's not just formalism, Your Honor, because one, the reversionary -- I am assuming that in your hypothetical the reversionary interest is gone."
2009.08-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2817.66,2828.391,"But there is also the point that I don't think you stressed, that if the reversionary interest was activated -- say they abandoned or destroyed it, the property would come back to the government."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2842.078,2860.521,"--I believe that that is correct, Justice Stevens, and that's an important point that is intertwined with the fact that the reversionary interest also continues the government's ownership in the land, when their whole position is, if we privatize it, as Justice Scalia pointed out, if it's just a private owner, then we don't associate this cross with the government."
2009.08-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2871.483,2887.134,"May I ask this question: Do you think the issues in this case would be -- stay the same or different, if this whole scenario occurred on the Mall in -- right out in front of the Washington -- the Lincoln Memorial?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2893.226,2900.066,--Context has always mattered to this Court in Establishment Clause cases.
2009.08-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.066,2902.019,"And which way would it cut, if it is different?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,2902.019,2914.452,"Well, I do think that Washington is, certainly, a seat of power, and there is, obviously, a close tie between something that is put on the National Mall in the seat of government, but I do think that the designation of a national memorial is also significant."
2009.08-472,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2974.394,2992.902,"Well, wasn't -- isn't this very different from the situation in Toledo Steel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the merits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if not technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they reached it, because of the passage of the new statute."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3055.718,3058.592,"Well, two points, if I may, Justice Alito."
2009.08-472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3104.575,3122.74,"I think General Kagan recognized that there isn't an example of a final injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the standing question that's already been determined."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3146.511,3158.038,"Going back, Justice Ginsburg, to the merits on the earlier question about a cross on government property, I believe that the Argonne Cross in the national -- in memorial cemetery is extremely different."
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3195.458,3204.314,Has the government ever turned down -- let's say the Jewish war veterans request to put up a war memorial on--
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3204.314,3204.673,--They did.
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.311,3211.45,--I am talking about -- on this site?
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3211.45,3211.887,Yes.
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.887,3241.328,"You know, well, I'm not talking about this site, where there already was a memorial, but suppose the -- what I'm getting at is I don't agree with you, that -- that every time the government allows any religious symbol to be erected, it has to allow all religious symbols to be erected at the same place, so long as it is -- it is not discriminatory in -- in accepting or rejecting requests to erect religious symbols in different places."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3245.968,3250.48,I think the context here is what has the government done with respect to national memorials.
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3258.104,3264.382,"But -- but you don't -- and they -- were both of them proposed by a private group, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3264.382,3270.27,"Well, it's Congress -- I don't know that the Veterans of Foreign Wars ever proposed that this be a national memorial."
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.002,3276.174,"Well, but it was erected by the Veterans of Foreign Wars."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3291.527,3293.449,As I said before--
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3293.449,3299.01,"I just don't see why they all have to be on the same piece of land, in -- in order for the government to be impartial."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3299.01,3306.537,"--I'm not saying that in -- in -- that, in every circumstance, the government has to have lots of different symbols, but what the government has done here--"
2009.08-472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3306.537,3309.987,"Well, I think you are saying that, and you are saying that this has to be a public forum."
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3318.188,3327.668,"--Well, Justice Scalia, if I make one prefatory point, the government didn't bring to this Court the merits of the question of whether the cross was permissible on government property."
2009.08-472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3387.911,3393.187,"May I ask a different question, just based on your understanding of all these monuments?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3402.171,3409.9,"The one national memorial that I am aware of that has a cross, it is of Father Marquette, who was a significant historical figure."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3450.291,3459.6,"Counsel, this probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but I'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up -- you know, in the middle of nowhere?"
2009.08-472,1,37851,peter_j_eliasberg,,3460.816,3475.81,"Because the man who originally put up the cross -- not this one, because it has been replaced a number of times, but the man who put up this particular cross, I believe was a homesteader in the area when the land was owned by the Bureau of Land Management, and I believe was a miner on the land."
2009.08-472,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3478.543,3479.404,Thank you.
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3481.526,3482.918,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3529.288,3530.068,How can you say that when there's a reversionary interest?
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3537.536,3545.58,"Justice Stevens, with respect, the reversionary interest says that the holder, the VFW, has to maintain a war memorial."
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3546.329,3549.515,"Yes, but the particular memorial described by Congress was this cross."
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3549.515,3553.686,"--No, the reversionary interest simply says: A war memorial."
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3556.026,3560.979,"Yes, but then it doesn't -- I don't think it's fair to interpret Congress's interest to being and preserving this memorial."
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3560.979,3562.605,"To the contrary, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3568.177,3568.759,Right.
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3568.759,3571.192,"In the 2004 act, it said something very different."
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3598.511,3603.21,Do you think anyone thought there is the remotest possibility they would put up a different memorial?
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3603.21,3608.226,"--I think it's left to the VFW, and it's entirely the VFW's choice."
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3621.722,3630.48,"How can they say it's an inappropriate war memorial when Congress has designated the national memorial as, quote, ""the five-foot-tall white cross"" and so forth and so on?"
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3632.418,3640.509,But there is no -- there is no prohibition on the VFW taking down this memorial.
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3644.226,3646.133,Do you really think there is any possibility that would happen?
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3646.133,3649.116,"--Again, I think it is entirely up to the VFW."
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3649.116,3649.693,That is not my question.
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3649.693,3653.144,"I don't know, because I am not the VFW."
2009.08-472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3677.839,3686.645,"They not only started it out, but they authorized the use of $10,000 in money in order to replace the very cross they had designated as a memorial."
2009.08-472,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3686.645,3702.297,"--Justice Stevens, you are, of course, right that Congress thought at the beginning, prior to the injunction, that this war memorial should not be taken down, that there was an attachment to it in the local community, and that it was -- that it should be retained."
2009.08-472,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3732.784,3733.845,"Thank you, counsel."
