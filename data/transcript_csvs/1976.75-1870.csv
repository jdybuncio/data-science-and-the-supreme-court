1976.75-1870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.549,"We will hear arguments next in 75-1870 and 1872, Du Pont De Nemours & Co. v. Collins, and the consolidated case."
1976.75-1870,0,20824,david_ferber,,43.08,47.475,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,235.398,241.299,"Mr. Ferber, I suppose it is not relevant, but how long has Christiana been in existence?"
1976.75-1870,0,20824,david_ferber,,245.192,251.116,"Yes, it was formed around 1915, I believe, Your Honor."
1976.75-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.518,374.53,"Well, I take that there is no challenge or question about the qualifications of tax-free transaction with the Internal Revenue Code?"
1976.75-1870,0,20824,david_ferber,,374.53,384.658,As I understand the internal revenue people have approved the proposed transactions.
1976.75-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.752,710.947,"Christiana’s stock was not really involved in this merger, was it, except insofar as determining what amount of Du Pont stock after the merger the various Christiana’s stockholders would receive."
1976.75-1870,0,20824,david_ferber,,710.947,715.952,"Exactly, the stock will disappear and Christiana will disappear."
1976.75-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,720.964,724.965,Owners of the stock will receive in terms of Du Pont shares after the merger.
1976.75-1870,0,20824,david_ferber,,724.965,726.298,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1976.75-1870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,984.854,1003.363,"We will resume there, Mr. Ferber, at 1 o’clock."
1976.75-1870,0,20824,david_ferber,,1005.299,1006.838,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-1870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1397.914,1405.503,Very Well.
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1406.043,1409.214,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.254,1798.066,"Mr. Gribbon, would you tell me where the Commission said -- that I was under the impression they said there was a range that was okay, and that this fell within the range."
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1798.066,1805.445,"They said that it was at the upper part of the range, that something lower would have been satisfactory, but nothing significantly higher."
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.726,1819.046,"Well, I see."
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1819.046,1826.951,"It is at the bottom of Page 35, on the top of Page 36 in the Appendix on petition."
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.948,1946.248,"Would you carry that argument to the point at which if there had been overreaching in the sense that Christiana had a benefit that was so large there was some detriment to Du Pont, that the Commission could not have disapproved there?"
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1946.248,1947.789,"They could have disapproved, but the Commission went out of its way --"
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.789,1949.885,Even though the impact was not on the investment company shareholders?
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1949.885,1961.322,"No, the Commission took the view, and I think quite properly, that in one of these transactions, to look out for the shareholders of both companies, not just the investment company, but for the shareholders of the affiliate and for the management of both companies."
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1961.322,1967.353,Do you attach any independent significance to the word overreaching as opposed to the words fair and reasonable?
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1973.256,1985.299,"I cannot Your Honor attach any precise significance to the use of that, I think it is fairly common drafting of legislation to use a lot of words, and I think this just may have occurred to somebody as being a stopgap."
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.641,2001.415,Your view on the legal question then is that as long as there is no detriment to either side it would be fair and reasonable within the statute?
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2001.415,2002.592,Yes.
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.016,2017.768,"Even if you assume, as the Commission did for purposes of decision, that arm’s length bargaining might have resulted in a transaction between willing parties, it would have been somewhat different?"
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2017.768,2018.86,I think that is right.
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.886,2028.074,I think they assumed that for --
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2028.074,2028.866,They assumed it.
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.866,2029.179,Yeah.
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2029.179,2038.231,"If that is the case then I think the Investment Company Act creates an entirely new standard; one of fair, reasonable, and lack of overreaching."
1976.75-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.911,2064.664,"I take it we should judge this case on the same assumption then that an arm’s length bargaining would have had a different result, we should judge it on that basis."
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2064.664,2069.931,"I would say it might have had a different result, I think that is what the Commission was saying."
1976.75-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.121,2095.101,We are not going to first engage in any independent fact-finding as to whether or not arm’s length bargaining would have produced a different result.
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2095.101,2096.097,I would not think so.
1976.75-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.097,2103.256,"We just take it the way the Commission judged it, even if it would have -- it was -- this is fair and reasonable."
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2103.256,2107.215,This is fair and reasonable and reflects no overreaching.
1976.75-1870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.215,2122.347,"You can conceive of the case I suppose Mr. Gribbon, where even at the appellate reviewing level you could make a determination, perhaps something that was so flagrant that on its face it would be unreasonable."
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2122.347,2127.61,In that event I should think you would be reversing the Commission’s finding that there was no overreaching.
1976.75-1870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2129.316,2130.951,An Appellate Court would be required to do that.
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2130.951,2132.664,Would be justified I think in doing that.
1976.75-1870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.664,2134.527,"And then it would go back to the Commission, perhaps."
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2134.527,2138.627,Go back to it.
1976.75-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.893,2242.04,"Now, the price was related to the actual market price of Du Pont shares?"
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2242.04,2247.697,"Yes, at the time of the merger, but as the Du Pont shares predominant value or upper value floats --"
1976.75-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.697,2249.528,We understand.
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2258.856,2259.948,Control premium?
1976.75-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.506,2272.981,"Well, did the SEC talk about that at all?"
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2272.981,2274.764,Did not address itself to that point.
1976.75-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.764,2280.311,Did they make any finding as to whether there was a potential for control?
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2280.311,2286.69,"They said there was under their Act, there was a presumption of control under the Investment Company Act with an ownership of more than 25%."
1976.75-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.69,2290.374,"But in arriving at their judgment of value, they did not mention this fact?"
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2290.374,2293.945,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2626.822,2630.37,"Mr. Gribbon, before you sit down, could you answer one question for me?"
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2641.613,2645.338,The record discloses only that the Court drafted those questions.
1976.75-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.338,2649.681,And the order indicates that there was a five-day period in which you could respond to the report.
1976.75-1870,1,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2650.464,2651.855,We did so respond.
1976.75-1870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2702.545,2704.346,Mr. Collins.
1976.75-1870,2,39027,richard_j_collins-_jr,,2704.346,2709.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1870,3,34889,lewis_c_murtaugh,,4383.684,4387.729,Mr. Murtaugh.
1976.75-1870,3,34889,lewis_c_murtaugh,,4387.729,5280.16,"On the back page of my brief is, almost back, Page 70, I have a list of who gets what out of this merger."
