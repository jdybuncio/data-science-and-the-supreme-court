1988.87-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.997,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1097, Otis R. Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,13.027,19.9,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,61.633,74.048,"Mr. Lazarus, I guess if we were to find that the Medicare Act itself prohibits retroactive rulemaking in this instance we wouldn't have to go on and reach the APA question, would we?"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,74.048,75.907,Technically the Court would not have to.
1988.87-1097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,108.426,114.86,"But still, the answer to Justice O'Connor's question is in the affirmative."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,114.86,115.875,--Yes.
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.076,219.584,"Mr. Lazarus, before you go further with the facts, I presume that the Secretary could have amended the rule in such a fashion as to eliminate the unfair disadvantage without eliminating what he regarded as the unfair advantage, in which case there would have been nobody to challenge the retroactive rule."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,219.584,223.302,The Secretary could have approached it all kinds of different ways.
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.864,229.001,"Well, I mean, you mentioned that it unfairly disadvantaged some people and unfairly advantaged others."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,237.482,242.386,"--Well, not actually, I think, under the way that the respondents would see the case."
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.538,263.112,"But the Secretary could have issued the rule eliminating the unfair disadvantage, not the unfair advantage, and there would have been no one to challenge it."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,263.112,264.534,"No, it was the same rule."
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.534,265.737,I understand it.
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,268.001,275.373,"What, provided two different rules for two different... the Secretary is certainly within his discretion to announce one rule applying to the entire--"
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.373,282.948,"--My point is that we don't have to find for you, in order to enable the unfair disadvantaged to be eliminated."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,285.119,295.396,"--Well, I think we're actually fighting about, about both, particularly to the extent that we're dealing with the broader questions of the Secretary's authority in the future to promulgate retroactive rules."
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.765,315.81,"The Secretary can do all sorts of things, so long as it doesn't hurt anybody."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,315.81,316.637,Right.
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.793,359.464,"But Mr. Lazarus, didn't they also reimburse them under the 1979 rule?"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,359.464,362.947,He did reimburse them under the 1979 rule as a matter of administrative grace.
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.865,379.253,But did he reopen the... did he recoup the money that he paid pursuant to the 1979 rule?
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,379.253,380.159,I think he has.
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.44,383.892,"Oh, I thought it was for later years."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,388.764,400.65,"--A copy of the letter showing our qualification is included, appended to our reply brief, showing that we explicitly at the time they were reimbursed pursuant to the 1979 rule it was made explicit that if the Secretary subsequently determined--"
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,400.65,403.977,And that particular reimbursement was then recouped?
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,403.977,404.446,--That's right.
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.555,407.07,"Well, I wonder why they even reimbursed him."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,407.07,410.849,I think it's a matter of administrative grace to get things going.
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,411.443,414.707,"As a matter of administrative grace, just lend them the money, in effect."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,414.707,419.705,"--Well it wasn't, it was basically to keep the program moving."
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.273,570.285,"Mr. Lazarus, when the government quotes Section 551 in its brief it unfortunately makes something of an ellipsis."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,620.982,623.513,--I think it doesn't affect our case.
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.316,649.284,I don't understand the point of that comment.
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,651.627,652.127,--No.
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.914,728.409,"--But dealing with past transactions in prescribing rules for the future, that may mean from now on you will treat past transactions in this fashion."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,731.985,733.938,"We think the better reading, though--"
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.938,735.436,"Well, I'm sure you do, but I don't--"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,735.436,738.075,--And I think there are other factors in the legislative history.
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.836,791.68,"--Well, has any court ever suggested that ""future effect"" means what you say it means?"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,791.68,795.991,"--No court... well, actually the District Court in the Southern District of Ohio."
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,824.978,827.383,"Well, aren't the words completely redundant under your view?"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,831.741,834.802,--But that's the purpose of the definition provision in the <APA> [= APA].
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.914,877.769,"If that's what future effect means, that is it has some effect in the future though it also has effect in the past, how do you distinguish a rule from an adjudication?"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,902.43,908.912,"Well they only... they have, they have an ongoing future effect in terms of effectiveness, while adjudication is different."
1988.87-1097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,968.154,978.214,"Well, Mr. Lazarus, it seems that you're arguing that the APA allows retroactive rulemaking any time it isn't, in your view, arbitrary and capricious."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,978.214,978.62,That's right.
1988.87-1097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,979.68,986.709,"Well, that just seems to make retroactive rulemaking totally available."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,986.709,988.537,"--Well no, we don't think it will be totally available."
1988.87-1097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1010.263,1017.041,"Well, the facts of this case don't lend themselves readily to supporting the rule, even under your view."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1017.76,1018.619,"Well, we think that--"
1988.87-1097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1018.619,1025.711,"I mean, to avoid the effect of failing to, to apply with the APA in the first instance?"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1025.711,1038.657,"--No, we think that this is a very good case for the arbitrary and capricious standard, because the respondents incurred all of their costs prior to the time at which the 1981 was first invalidated on procedural grounds."
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.213,1058.104,"Well, Congress could have done it."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1083.375,1084.063,--That's true.
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.063,1086.749,So the situation is quite different from the legislative situation.
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1086.749,1107.037,"But we believe that Congress, when it delegates general rulemaking authority to an agency, it includes the authority in discreet circumstances to deal with, to impose retroactive rules, knowing that the kinds of concerns that one has with retroactivity can be addressed through the arbitrary and capricious review."
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.068,1347.22,"Mr. Lazarus, does the record tell us what you're telling us about the fact the rule actually caused the government to give more money away?"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1347.22,1347.453,No.
1988.87-1097,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.75,1350.438,"Oh, it's theoretically possible."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1350.438,1350.984,"We don't, we don't, we don't have--"
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.554,1397.543,"There's no question that under the, under the provision of, of the subject legislation, the Secretary could have recomputed for each of those individual hospitals the charges and found that the regulations didn't provide a fair return in this situation."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1398.73,1400.839,It's within the Secretary's discretion.
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.839,1403.134,Both sides acknowledge that.
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1403.134,1403.759,That's right.
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.331,1434.249,"Are you going to address the point of what regulation takes over, if the agency cannot issue a new one retroactively?"
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1434.249,1438.826,"--Our dispute with the Court of Appeals on that, on that question is the following."
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.161,1504.517,"Well, leaving aside your retroactive argument, which just gets us back into the main problem, I had always thought that a rule could only be amended by a rule."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1517.715,1525.135,But the question is whether it has the effect of them precluding the agency ultimately on remand from deciding what rule of law should apply.
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.092,1553.997,"Although the agency can only decide one thing, it may be."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1553.997,1557.902,"--Well, that's where, of course, we disagree."
1988.87-1097,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.464,1564.213,Does this argument of yours hinge upon your retroactivity argument?
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1572.724,1592.169,"--Again, it would depend on the nature... in some instances, for instance, the court's decision would only suggest that the substance of the new rule was valid, and it might not, it might only question the agency's determination that a substance of a new rule was valid itself."
1988.87-1097,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1613.129,1620.672,"Mr. Lazarus, in your reply brief, you have as an appendix a letter dated January 31, 1984."
1988.87-1097,0,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1622.532,1625.703,It's my understanding that it is not formally part of the record.
1988.87-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.763,1631.67,Very well.
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1633.387,1641.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:"
1988.87-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.333,1787.654,"Well what if, what if the Secretary had promulgated a rule applicable to this past period which, which was aimed at refunding to people who had paid on what the Secretary now thought was an improper basis?"
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1787.654,1789.778,"Well, I don't know--"
1988.87-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.778,1791.138,Would that be--
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1791.138,1792.2,--Justice White--
1988.87-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.2,1797.479,"--Now, what you're really saying is that this rule that he promulgated isn't a rule at all under the definition."
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1797.479,1798.383,--It is not a rule.
1988.87-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.383,1803.397,"And so, and so the rule that I just described would not be a rule."
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1803.397,1824.077,"I think that's correct, Justice White, but I think, as Justice Judge Oberdorfer stated in his case below, it is well established administrative law that an agency may always waive application of a rule when in individual circumstances he thinks justice so requires."
1988.87-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.077,1825.279,"Well, that may be so."
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1825.669,1827.919,It would simply be a matter--
1988.87-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.919,1828.809,--He couldn't do it by rule.
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1828.809,1831.964,"--Well, it would be a matter of waiving his past rule."
1988.87-1097,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.31,1950.385,"Mr. Sutter, let me come back to the problem of the Secretary revising the regulation in order to give more money to some people."
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1962.944,1963.722,"I, I think--"
1988.87-1097,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.722,1973.594,"But if he wanted to be technically correct, I suppose he could, what, present a, in an appropriations bill a little, a little line that says--"
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1973.594,1977.686,"--That, that would certainly be a possibility, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-1097,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.686,1982.403,"--What, what opposition would that likely confront in Congress, if the Secretary's in favor of it?"
1988.87-1097,1,40387,ronald_n_sutter,,1982.403,1984.855,I don't think it would incur any opposition.
1988.87-1097,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3346.319,3348.412,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1097,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3372.684,3375.823,"Only one error, that's all."
1988.87-1097,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3379.197,3383.352,"--It was an, it was an error which required... the Secretary promulgated a new rule."
1988.87-1097,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3427.895,3432.957,"But if the statute reads the way you say, why do you have to narrow it to circumstances?"
1988.87-1097,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3441.391,3442.016,But there--
1988.87-1097,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3442.016,3445.359,I presume the rules would be the same as for retroactive adjudication.
1988.87-1097,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3452.823,3465.022,"--The same concerns, though, whether or not the retroactive rule is essentially necessary under Congressional intent is precisely the test that we suggest would be appropriate under arbitrary and capricious review."
1988.87-1097,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3486.029,3487.06,"Thank you, Mr. Lazarus."
