2009.08-678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.494,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-678, Mohawk Industries v. Carpenter."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,11.305,16.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-678,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,53.556,71.814,"Mr. Allen, except for the fact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think that the -- that confidentiality right is any more important to the proper functioning of society than, let's say, the protection of trade secrets?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,93.539,99.364,"Justice Scalia, there are -- there are several answers to the question."
2009.08-678,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,131.165,132.6,The same thing with a trade secret.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,135.443,136.519,Well--
2009.08-678,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.519,143.811,"--And the Judge says, turn over your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and you say no."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,146.14,148.0,--I think with trade secrets--
2009.08-678,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,148.0,150.203,Or do you say there should be an interlocutory appeal there?
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,150.203,155.604,"--Your Honor, we do not argue that -- here, that there should be an interlocutory appeal for trade secrets."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,171.302,176.329,"But what if the court doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,198.539,201.147,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,222.076,222.45,Ah.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,223.168,233.225,"--But -- but the answer to the -- the importance question, I think, has to return to the central and important role that the privilege plays in the administration of justice."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,233.225,243.844,"But isn't the role -- the central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and open communication between client and attorney?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,246.046,249.498,"It -- it is the purpose of the rule, at least in part, Your Honor."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.498,249.732,All right.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,290.309,298.179,"Your Honor, I -- don't think we are here to suggest that it would stop people from talking to their lawyers."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,306.131,316.609,"Well -- but that's what I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made routinely by the lower courts."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,333.103,339.1,"--Your Honor, I don't think we suggest that -- that erroneous orders on privilege are occurring routinely."
2009.08-678,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.226,375.834,Okay.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,439.339,462.735,"Your Honor, I don't disagree that -- that the rule we search for will not still have problems with the protection of the attorney-client privilege, but I do disagree that it will not significantly improve the quality of the rules that counsel are -- are designed -- or counsel are -- are instructed to follow."
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,462.735,481.121,"Mr. Allen, you used a term before, and I think you were right in using it -- you said, v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the theory is, it is a final judgment."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,515.823,518.869,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.818,531.991,And that's what 1292(b) was meant to deal with.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,531.991,543.439,"I don't think 1292 would -- would obtain, in this instance, and I think the -- the judge in the district court made this observation himself, although he did not expound on his reasoning."
2009.08-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.979,565.288,Why do you think that your -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more important than any other privilege?
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,589.542,592.085,"No, Your Honor, you have not."
2009.08-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,592.085,607.613,"Well, if we don't allow collateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the priest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or something, I don't -- with a priest, or with a psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we allow collateral appeal here?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,607.613,615.062,"Your Honor, first of all, I don't think the issue of those other privileges has, to the best of my knowledge, come before this Court."
2009.08-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,615.062,627.884,"But then if we grant your collateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally grant it in every situation, where a judge arguably makes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,627.884,640.365,"I don't believe you do, Your Honor, and let me say, first of all, the -- the instance that Your Honor points to, where the information would be disclosed to the other party, it's not the other party in this instance, that--"
2009.08-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,640.365,640.661,It's the lawyer.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,640.661,642.19,--that you are worried about in first instance.
2009.08-678,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,656.576,673.585,"So it's -- in your opinion, it's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to clients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest or protect the wife or husband or protect the psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient?"
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,682.597,686.688,What is the use -- I'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,698.651,699.665,"Correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,699.665,702.192,So there is a remedy.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,716.952,719.312,"Your Honor, that -- I apologize."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,719.312,725.776,Why isn't that an effective remedy for the harm that you are claiming exists in the disclosure?
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,725.776,739.693,"That is the analysis that the Eleventh Circuit applied, and I think it was incorrect for the following reasons: First of all, it treats the attorney-client privilege as if it is a use privilege, as you describe it in your questioning."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,750.644,763.262,"You have to a right to choose your lawyer and not to be -- and not to be represented by a -- by a different lawyer, and yet we don't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,763.262,764.323,--That's--
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,764.323,770.57,Why is this any greater in terms of the harm that your client suffers?
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,770.57,785.645,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but in the attorney-client privilege cases, this Court did not find that collateral order jurisdiction did not obtain because of the fact that the attorney-client privilege or the attorney-client -- excuse me -- disqualification cases were not important."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,795.593,797.407,I understand what the court below did.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,808.462,823.99,"--Justice Sotomayor, the -- the importance in this instance is -- is measured against the societal importance or the societal need for non-piecemeal application of the final judgment rule."
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,841.792,843.183,It's not -- it's not a rule of efficiency.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,898.534,902.406,"I understand your question, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,912.323,921.463,"But you are carving out an area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the kind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,961.554,970.269,"--I agree, Justice Ginsburg that that was the kind of narrow issue that was at issue in -- in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial."
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,982.233,992.165,"Because those are cases that say your right is not to be tried, your right is not to be exposed to trial at all."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,992.165,994.992,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.329,1010.86,May I ask two yes or no questions?
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1017.123,1018.137,"No, Your Honor, we did not."
2009.08-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.137,1023.011,"And the second question is, would your rule apply if the decision had gone the other way?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1031.773,1037.442,"No, Your Honor, the -- the party losing the claim would not have the same right to appeal."
2009.08-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.442,1037.785,Why not?
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1037.785,1047.249,I think access to information in the course of discovery does not trigger the same important interest that orders compelling discovery of attorney-client would trigger?
2009.08-678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1061.759,1067.538,"Some time ago Justice Breyer asked the question of why is this different than the other privileges, and I would like your answer to that."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1067.538,1089.168,"Justice Breyer, I think that the answer to that question has to focus on the role that the privilege plays in the administration of justice, and it's why I went, in response to Justice Sotomayor's question, why I went to the balancing between the interest of the attorney-client privilege versus the interest of a more rigorous application of the final judgment rule."
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1105.208,1131.384,"Mr. Allen, one of the purposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of Cohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not going to come up very often, but attorney-client privilege, once you say that that's open to -- everything stops while you go to the court of appeals to get that."
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1153.315,1161.279,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe that the attorney would be obligated to take the appeal."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1243.614,1269.338,"Are you -- just so I'm clear about your position, are you arguing that all issues related to attorney-client, whether they are waiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege, et cetera, that all issues are immediately appealable because the public interest is the same in all cases related to the attorney-client privilege, or are you wanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1269.338,1271.246,"Correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1276.665,1281.536,"So -- but your position logically would apply to everything, wouldn't it?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1281.536,1282.835,Your Honor--
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1282.835,1286.863,"Otherwise, how do we distinguish or make a difference in your analysis?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1286.863,1296.016,"--I think it's certainly -- it certainly should be assumed that if this Court rules in our favor, it must conclude that the attorney-client privilege is important."
2009.08-678,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1297.607,1299.622,No one is doubting its importance.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1304.759,1305.539,--I -- I agree.
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.817,1437.72,"Is there any sensible line between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and a holding that the privilege has been waived?"
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1447.932,1458.414,"Other than the examples that I -- that I just gave, Your Honor, I don't think there is a principled difference between the finding of importance, and that is -- that is clearly a threshold issue."
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1488.87,1489.743,There is another.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1504.83,1507.065,"No, Your Honor--"
2009.08-678,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1507.065,1510.173,But it's certainly -- it's certainly protected against disclosure.
2009.08-678,0,38594,randall_l__allen,,1510.173,1517.484,--We do not extend the -- the rule that we advocate to work product in the -- in the broad sense.
2009.08-678,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.468,1550.033,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1562.949,1563.776,Thank you.
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1622.909,1626.593,"We will get to that, I think, when the government lawyer gets up."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1628.89,1631.733,I think the--
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1631.733,1634.385,"Government lawyers get the privilege, private lawyers don't?"
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1634.385,1640.932,"--As I understand the government's position here, it's that ordinary lawyers don't get the privilege in ordinary litigation."
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1686.256,1694.332,But we are talking about the central privilege to the maintenance of the adversary system which we've determined to be central to maintaining the rule of law.
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1727.801,1732.126,"--Well, there are remedies -- there are two directions for an answer."
2009.08-678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1760.331,1760.97,That is in the Third Circuit.
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1760.97,1777.918,"--Well, the Third, the Ninth and the D.C. together are the three that have opened up the door, and they have found -- the experience of those appellate judges has not found that it is easy to make the distinction among these, and as a consequence there is appeal as of right to this entire cluster of cases."
2009.08-678,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1777.918,1786.789,"Mr. Allen has told us that there are very few cases, in fact 11 cases in I don't know how many years, in the Third Circuit."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1786.789,1791.457,"Well, I take to be -- the cheerful news is that by and large everyone is getting it right at the trial level."
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1828.537,1830.347,"Well, it matters which they do, right?"
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1834.581,1843.562,"--We found about half the cases, and the law professors amici and judges amici found about 104, in which in which disclosure was required, in the six-month period."
2009.08-678,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1863.036,1867.442,I was on the Third Circuit for eight years under this regime.
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1888.776,1898.864,"I am not going to convince you that the sky is going to fall, but I am going to suggest that the Cohen rule does not apply to these cases not only because the sky isn't going to fall."
2009.08-678,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1935.477,1937.942,So the Eleventh Circuit was wrong on that issue?
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1940.501,1957.978,"In our view, every one of the -- this case failed the test on all four -- three to four of the Cohen prongs, which is separability and conclusiveness or -- or distinct ideas, potentially, importance, and remediability."
2009.08-678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1993.74,2003.141,"Ms. Resnick, can you go back and articulate what you see as the rule that we have on what is important enough?"
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2028.209,2038.828,"Well, Cohen involved the major question of the application of the Erie principle in 1949 involving a state -- the right of security for expenses."
2009.08-678,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2113.924,2125.635,"But are you suggesting that -- that Cohen itself wouldn't come out the same way today if the question of security for costs, whether State or Federal, hadn't been settled?"
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2125.635,2134.599,"Well, Cohen predates this -- the Congress's creation of 1292(b), which you mentioned earlier, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.672,2167.512,"But it is a bit of a hurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the materially advanced -- the litigation and those other criteria?"
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2167.512,2169.493,There are a few selective waiver cases.
2009.08-678,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2223.714,2225.435,But that is only in egregious cases.
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2225.435,2228.043,In the extraordinary case there is mandamus.
2009.08-678,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2237.117,2241.243,Are you -- are you arguing that the collateral order door is closed now?
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2244.382,2252.47,"I can't forecast future cases, except to say that this Court has repeatedly in the last decade narrowed the door substantially."
2009.08-678,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2280.69,2283.81,"An interlocutory appeal doesn't have to stop everything, does it?"
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2283.81,2296.182,The -- as a rule of filing a notice of appeal with a court of appeal at the -- a statutory rule provision puts the -- stays the district court activity.
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2398.108,2408.356,"The usual way that the district court, after denying the recognition of the privilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the lawyer to go to jail."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2428.236,2439.264,"--Well, it is the case that Judge Wilkinson recently reiterated Judge Friendly's suggestion that -- or commentary that contempt is a provision that is available."
2009.08-678,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.701,2446.275,"And how -- how is it -- unless the judge cooperates, it has to be criminal contempt."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2452.148,2472.982,"--What -- we have found that many courts of appeals have responded, precisely because of either the draconian nature of criminal contempt or the possibility that it won't issue, by looking at some of these cases, in the extraordinary instance, through mandamus and there are at least a dozen mandamus--"
2009.08-678,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2472.982,2487.761,"--But mandamus is supposed -- not supposed to be a run about the final judgment rule, and if -- and if Cohen v. Beneficial is available, then mandamus would not lie, right?"
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2487.761,2490.76,"--That is directly -- that is exactly correct, yes."
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2565.01,2568.54,"Well, a protective order isn't going to work -- a protective order isn't going to work at all."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2578.816,2589.717,--In -- the -- underlying the privilege is the workings of the system for both private ordering and for the justice system.
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2617.584,2621.114,"Well, but the -- you know, the -- the American Bar Association has said the exact opposite."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2629.594,2639.448,"--I appreciate -- and before you on amici, on both sides, are people deeply committed to the administration of justice."
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2639.448,2651.146,"Oh, sure, the other people are, too, but we -- I, at least, look at a brief of the American Bar Association and view that as a representation of how the people affected here, the lawyers, view the value of the privilege and what will happen to it."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2651.146,2661.765,"And I believe that the judges and lawyers and law professors, who have written to you on the other side, are committed to understanding that the privilege is important instrumentally."
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2662.065,2672.106,"Oh, but the law -- the law professors aren't the ones who deal with this question on a day-to-day basis and have to worry about going to jail, if they want to protect their client's -- what they view as their ethical obligations."
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2672.106,2678.619,"--There are many provisions short of going to jail, and, furthermore, I want to come back to the -- to the rule, the limited--"
2009.08-678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2678.619,2681.259,But it's only going to jail that gives you criminal intent.
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2681.259,2681.961,--Yes.
2009.08-678,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2682.445,2683.63,That's immediately appealable.
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2683.63,2700.921,"And the -- the underlying insight of Cohen, is that there are many instances when dramatic events occur in the dynamics of trial, but the Congress has concluded that the final judgment rule requires waiting till you get to the end."
2009.08-678,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2734.344,2740.7,"Is the attorney-client claim sometimes raised, along with a host of other discovery issues, as a bargaining chip?"
2009.08-678,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2740.7,2748.572,"--These are packages that -- yes, the attorney-client privilege -- and this is granular work by district and magistrate judges of -- of hundreds of thousands of pieces of paper."
2009.08-678,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2767.688,2768.363,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2780.748,2784.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2814.861,2817.169,"Well, except when the government is the one raising it."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2817.169,2817.825,--No.
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2826.177,2836.02,"Yes, but, in the government context, what would be in the private context, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a different type of governmental privilege."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2850.763,2858.824,"--Let me also stress, we are not arguing that a denial of the assertion of the deliberative process privilege is immediately appealable."
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.542,2900.026,"So you are saying that you -- government lawyers cannot seek an interlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other than Presidential communications and State secrets?"
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2900.026,2907.786,I don't want to rule out the possibility that there could be a statutory privilege of some -- of some particular sort--
2009.08-678,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2907.786,2912.474,"Well, you could -- you could seek an interlocutory appeal under 1292(b)."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2912.474,2915.691,--That -- that would be -- that would be available in an appropriate case.
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2922.858,2923.919,I'm sorry.
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2953.86,2950.315,No.
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3014.552,3023.453,You don't think that the attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who gets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was an issue in Cohen?
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3023.453,3027.108,We -- I think the -- I do not.
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3060.824,3085.41,"We are not talking about -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to is, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like every other evidentiary privilege that you have just listed, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of things, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is different, even more important than who has to post security for costs, because it is central to the rule of law, because it is central to how the adversary system functions."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3085.41,3114.333,"--I think the more precise question, Mr. Chief Justice, is whether the -- the question is whether the denial of an attorney-client privilege threatens to -- so substantially undermine the values of the privilege to warrant an immediate appeal, and I think, as has been pointed out by several of the Justices here, there are -- there are exceptions to the privilege, which -- which will -- might undermine the confidence people might have in it."
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3136.856,3140.401,But the review -- I follow your answer but the review on final judgment is meaningless.
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3141.618,3143.505,"Well, it's not entirely meaningless."
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3158.675,3162.015,"The injury to the party, but not the injury to the attorney-client privilege."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3162.015,3174.946,"--Well, again, the -- the question is -- the attorney/client privilege is not for competence in its own right but to encourage frank communications in order to promote litigation in the function of lawyers."
2009.08-678,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3199.674,3206.092,"Mr. Kneedler, I think I have this right, but correct me if I am wrong."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3242.701,3245.633,That's -- that's a very important -- that's a very important point.
2009.08-678,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3246.105,3249.557,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, is true that true, that the case goes on?"
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3261.099,3261.817,--They are.
2009.08-678,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3266.235,3267.799,"Right, because there never could be an appeal."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3267.799,3268.516,"--Well, but the--"
2009.08-678,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3268.516,3278.682,"It means that the erroneous -- if there was an erroneous ruling, it's built into the -- it's irretrievably built into -- well not irretrievably, but powerfully built into the bargaining--"
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3278.682,3281.401,--But that's the nature of trial proceedings and discovery.
2009.08-678,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3311.247,3314.153,"--If the privilege were in a statute, that would make a difference?"
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3314.153,3319.167,I don't think so if there was a statute that just codified the -- the privileges like this.
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3328.006,3354.309,"Putting aside the question of whether the attorney-client privilege has a good pedigree in public law, my experience has been that litigants on one side frequently request and demand in discovery material that they know is covered by the attorney-client privilege, one, precisely because that's where the good stuff is; and two, because it gives them leverage, because they know that the other side is going to have to go through this impossible process and can't get an immediate appeal."
2009.08-678,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3357.043,3367.021,"--I think and that's a -- district judges are -- are -- who manage these cases every day can see through that, and -- and -- and can be trusted to, by and large, make correct results."
2009.08-678,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.448,3401.54,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2009.08-678,3,38594,randall_l__allen,,3403.9,3420.219,I would like to address the question that Justice Alito raised with regard to whether or not an appeal of a collateral issue dealing with waiver or privilege would stay the litigation.
2009.08-678,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3438.933,3440.945,"It doesn't go ahead with the trial, does it?"
2009.08-678,3,38594,randall_l__allen,,3440.945,3442.552,--He has not gone ahead with the trial.
2009.08-678,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.552,3444.065,"It never would, would it?"
2009.08-678,3,38594,randall_l__allen,,3444.065,3446.896,He is certainly empowered to do so.
2009.08-678,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3446.896,3452.422,"Well, just go ahead with trial while a material issue is still pending, I can't imagine that."
2009.08-678,3,38594,randall_l__allen,,3452.422,3461.137,"Your Honor, the scenario that you raise would put the attorney or the client, depending on who is in the box, if you will, to some hard choices."
2009.08-678,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3476.478,3482.849,I can't imagine a judge going to trial in a case when an important issue like this is pending on appeal.

2009.08-678,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3580.326,3589.446,"So -- so, I think any system of -- that denies you the interlocutory appeal, will, in fact, work some injustice."
2009.08-678,3,38594,randall_l__allen,,3636.782,3640.971,"Your Honor, I do not have any empirical information to answer that question."
2009.08-678,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3658.113,3670.939,"Is it wrong for me to expect that if this would work, a lot of instances of serious hardship not allowing the appeal, some lawyers in their meetings would be upset and they would raise a few examples?"
2009.08-678,3,38594,randall_l__allen,,3675.201,3679.061,"I don't believe it does, Your Honor, I don't believe that should count against us."
