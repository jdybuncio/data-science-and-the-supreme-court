2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.202,"We'll hear argument next in Case 10-545, Golan v. Holder."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,6.237,8.939,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,35.137,40.625,You said that Congress can set a time limit.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,75.862,82.718,The problem is Congress is now setting a second limit long after the first one has come and gone.
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,82.718,88.622,"But the person -- the person we are talking about, the work we are talking about, never got the first limit."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,122.51,124.295,So let me just clarify one thing.
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,131.699,139.555,"They didn't get the equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the large category, because it's the ones that you feature."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,146.708,151.01,--Congress has been setting the limited time at zero since 1790.
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,160.016,160.332,That's not a limited time.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,162.068,172.656,"--Well, but saying you have no time is itself picking the limit because the language of the Copyright Clause forces Congress to pick a limit that constraints copyright by marking its end."
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.41,179.262,"But it has to have a beginning, too."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,187.933,189.635,"No, there does not need to be a beginning."
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.878,236.016,I can understand your argument that the public domain is untouchable.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,271.319,272.271,--Well--
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,272.271,275.89,"The foreign works that we didn't give, we're not treating them any better."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,281.977,282.643,--Right.
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,310.561,312.412,We're not talking about expiration dates.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,313.962,314.614,--Sure.
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,314.614,322.452,That's not -- that's not -- none of these -- none of these copyrights have been extended beyond their expiration date.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,324.387,333.826,"Well, taking works that got no protection -- if Congress is not required to respect its decision to deny a work any protection in the first place, we can never know whether we've reached the end or not."
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.734,357.108,"But that is -- that is not -- that is most distinctly not before this case, so please let's not talk about a copyright that has been protected, has expired, and Congress wants to revive it."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,369.749,370.066,Well--
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.066,371.701,They never had a limited time before.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,371.701,375.903,"--Well, I -- I was talking -- de Tocqueville never got any time, because he was a foreign author."
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.031,400.554,"Did anyone in the same -- the same -- published the same year as de Tocqueville, a U.S. author, that would have a copyright protection today?"
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,400.554,401.07,I'm sorry.
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.67,406.874,I gave the example of Aaron Copeland versus Shostakovich.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,415.314,416.68,The answer is nobody.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,439.695,445.499,"Under your -- under your theory, let's say you have a copyright that expires on October 5th, okay?"
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,450.737,450.97,Yes.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,450.97,451.653,Right.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,456.039,464.128,"That's exactly right, because the limit the Copyright Clause requires us to pick is an end date with permanent consequence."
2011.10-545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,476.102,481.006,But it -- it seems to -- it seems to me that that was rejected in -- in our most recent and earlier case on copyright.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,481.006,482.122,In Eldred?
2011.10-545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.122,482.539,Yes.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,482.539,483.624,"No, No."
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,496.766,506.324,"Counsel, there was no limit here, meaning these foreign works were never given the opportunity to be copyrighted."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,534.891,543.013,"--The answer is no, it's not different; and Congress treated those situations exactly the same in all 19 amendments over the span of 200 years."
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,543.013,543.413,The problem--
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,543.413,544.563,It gave equal respect.
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,544.563,547.817,"--I -- I know, but it didn't do it when it set up the copyright system."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,547.817,548.684,"Oh, it did."
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,548.684,553.436,"In 1790, counsel, there were three States that didn't give copyrights."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,602.868,605.653,"Well, let me be clear about what happened in 1790."
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,617.211,618.83,Read those words to me?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,618.83,632.638,"So -- I'm looking at section 1 of the 1790 Act, and at -- at the beginning it talks about:"
2011.10-545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.872,657.238,Wait a minute.
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,664.292,666.978,You have to have a--
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,666.978,668.763,--You do have to have a copyright.
2011.10-545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.084,675.7,Read it again?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,676.45,677.701,Sure.
2011.10-545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.701,681.653,--or have not transferred to any other person?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,681.653,682.837,Right.
2011.10-545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.605,687.821,Oh.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,688.14,688.657,Yes.
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,694.044,697.162,--Your reading of that passage is different than mine.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,702.331,706.268,--But let me speak to the point you raised about common law protection for published works.
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,748.095,751.464,"If we disagree with your proposition, does your argument fail?"
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,756.367,759.033,--You mean the 1790 Act or the 19 after it?
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,759.033,759.569,In 1790.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,763.354,763.871,"No, I -- no."
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,770.691,773.877,--it started in the place you want Congress to have started now.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,773.877,774.779,"--Well, no, but then--"
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,774.779,777.531,"It said, moving forward, there is a Federal copyright."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,783.935,785.268,"--Oh, I will assume they did."
2011.10-545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.502,813.97,Can you tell me a little bit about the phrase and the argument about the public domain?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,828.664,843.723,"--Well, so to be precise, our position is once Congress calls the limit, that is, once it says this work is unprotected, whether it's the expiration of 28 years or a decision to give it no protection, it's creating affirmative rights in every member of the public."
2011.10-545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,846.258,855.114,"--But -- but how does the phrase -- so the public domain is simply a conclusion to express that, the operation of that principle?"
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,861.785,871.909,"--Well -- in -- in this case, when I refer to the public domain, it's the collection of things for which Congress had said protection is done, it's over, we've hit the limit, it's done."
2011.10-545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,873.176,875.295,"Once again, it's just a conclusion for the argument."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,875.295,877.128,--I -- I think that's the operative concept here.
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.545,883.632,"I think you gave an analogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you were quite right about that."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,926.978,936.166,"They had no time because Congress decided that their works were going to be ineligible, and a limit of zero is one Congress has been setting since 1790, and respected consistently."
2011.10-545,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.855,964.519,"But it isn't quite so, because there are these examples of people who couldn't get copyright because of wartime after both World War I and World War II, and -- so those people were allowed to get the protection that they couldn't get because of the war."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,964.519,965.286,That's correct.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,995.288,997.324,What about new categories?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1017.57,1018.236,Right.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1022.955,1023.222,"No, no, I know."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1023.222,1024.224,"It looked forward, right."
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1039.983,1043.518,"No, no, I'm just trying -- trying -- I'm trying to test the limit of your public domain argument."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1043.518,1043.985,--Sure.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1043.985,1048.172,Does it extend to new categories of copyrightable works?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1048.172,1055.659,I think the answer is the retrospective portion of that statute flunks progress of science but -- but passes limited times.
2011.10-545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.659,1076.609,"Would you -- would you spend a little bit of time on your other argument, I take it to be a separate argument apart from the -- you know, time limit argument, the argument that the problem here is that this law does not promote the progress of science and useful arts, and therefore does not comply with the Copyright Clause?"
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1076.609,1077.325,That's right.
2011.10-545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1077.325,1081.576,Why doesn't it promote the progress of science and the useful arts?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1081.576,1086.214,So -- the -- the progress of science corresponds roughly to the creation and spread of knowledge and learning.
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1104.609,1118.352,"You don't think that there are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't come into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect their works here, and kept their works in other markets that -- in which it was protected?"
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1118.352,1119.785,"--Well, I don't--"
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1119.785,1123.054,And it doesn't encourage them to sort of make investments?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1123.054,1124.304,--No.
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1127.839,1128.222,Why not?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1138.33,1142.516,"--Well, whether they came into this market or not has no effect on whether they can protect their works or not."
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1146.752,1147.752,You're -- you're not answering my question.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1154.339,1156.441,--I don't -- I don't see how it could.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1156.441,1170.166,"Well, one way it could, I suppose, is that it shows that Congress is interested in making sure that American authors overseas have reciprocal protection, an issue that could come out in a variety of contexts."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1182.259,1182.793,Yes.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1182.793,1184.042,"Well, that's -- that's an incentive."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1184.042,1184.593,Yes.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1200.554,1206.291,"No, I'm talking about -- but the same issue can come up again, you know, whether it's in the area of formalities, whatever."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1219.516,1220.366,--That's--
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1220.366,1221.268,That's an incentive.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1231.506,1232.023,--Perhaps.
2011.10-545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.477,1240.429,Let me put it -- I think it's the same point another way.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1264.996,1271.566,"Potentially, but the problem here, if I can move a little bit to the First Amendment, is the mechanism Congress chose to use here."
2011.10-545,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.089,1291.98,"Well, that's what the copyright law permits -- the -- the -- excluding things from the public domain, so long as in the process of doing it, you're furthering the arts."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1291.98,1294.13,--Well -- but let me focus on the First Amendment problem.
2011.10-545,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1327.57,1335.141,"But now you're saying that there is a substantive component to this public domain argument, that the public does own something."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1340.895,1342.163,"--In that case, I misspoke."
2011.10-545,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1352.685,1353.085,I'm curious.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1385.207,1392.529,"--I think -- I think that it could possibly incentivize him to bring it over to the United States, depending on how the statute worked."
2011.10-545,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.529,1394.881,"Well, isn't that the question?"
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1415.745,1416.345,I think that's right.
2011.10-545,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1416.345,1416.611,--That's not right?
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1416.611,1418.663,"No, I think you're correct."
2011.10-545,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1419.747,1422.449,"Well, don't just jump on my answer as being correct if it's not."
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1422.949,1433.089,"Counsel, it might be his incentive to buy it or not, but the question is the author's incentive to sell it here."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1450.801,1456.872,--The -- the -- the problem here is these authors are long gone.
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1465.092,1469.929,"Well, if you can't incentivize them, they are not going to claim their rights."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1469.929,1470.745,--I'm sorry?
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1470.745,1472.564,They are not going to come and claim their rights.
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1480.737,1481.253,No.
2011.10-545,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1488.607,1492.461,"Optional for them; but if they do, that's when they can sue a prior user."
2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1492.461,1493.211,--That's right.

2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1528.615,1530.317,--That's right.

2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1531.167,1536.721,"It's not going to incentivize anybody to create anything, and it only restricts the circulation of things that once circulated freely."

2011.10-545,0,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,1540.239,1540.873,Thank you.
2011.10-545,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1540.873,1552.313,General Verrilli.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1552.313,1554.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-545,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1657.18,1669.554,"Could Congress grant copyright protection to works that had lost that protection due to the expiration of the period that was provided for under, under previous law?"
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1669.554,1688.951,"--We think that the, there isn't an ironclad limit that can be derived from the text of the Copyright Clause or from history that would say that Congress is forbidden in any circumstance from doing that."
2011.10-545,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1715.851,1717.601,What's the limit that you're referring to?
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1717.601,1719.267,"Excuse me, Justice Sotomayor?"
2011.10-545,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.267,1720.017,You said there are limits.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1720.017,1720.367,Yes.
2011.10-545,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1720.367,1721.183,What--
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1721.183,1731.825,"Well, one limit I think is a quite important one is that the Copyright Clause says that you can only grant copyright in authors, to authors."
2011.10-545,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1759.975,1768.098,But doesn't this -- doesn't Section 514 provide copyright protection for works that were created by people who are long since dead?
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1768.098,1770.033,"Yes, it does."
2011.10-545,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1770.033,1774.235,So I don't understand the limit that you were just suggesting.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1774.235,1774.652,"Well, because they--"
2011.10-545,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1774.652,1777.354,Do they have to be dead for some period of time before--
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1777.354,1778.037,"--No, but it--"
2011.10-545,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1778.037,1779.806,--Congress is unable to give them back their copyright?
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1779.806,1780.256,--No.
2011.10-545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.844,1871.481,"General Verrilli, I do not find that an appealing argument."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1905.869,1907.437,We completely--
2011.10-545,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.437,1912.808,"It would be nice to know the reason for it, but you would still have to establish that it's within the power of the Federal government--"
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1912.808,1914.927,"--We completely agreement with that, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.837,1971.145,"No, but in Eldred the main difference is that in Eldred, there was a law that might, at least in principle, have elicited a new book."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1980.684,1981.851,I disagree.
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1981.851,1986.737,So by -- How does it give any benefit to anything because it's already created.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1986.737,2004.632,"Because it creates additional incentives for authors today and going forward, because they know that there is a much greater likelihood that whatever intellectual property they create will be better protected in foreign countries as a result of our joining the Berne Convention."
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.632,2006.151,How does this provision do that?
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2017.792,2018.742,Well--
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.742,2019.626,Is it not?
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2024.029,2032.135,"--But we can't -- If we can't get the protections of Berne, Berne is not a menu in which we get to choose options."
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.135,2032.518,"--Oh, oh."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2098.578,2099.144,"Right, but--"
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2099.144,2108.968,"--And they will say, no copyright law -- with your exception of when the country was founded -- no copyright law has served that kind of purpose."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2111.485,2112.087,--But--
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2112.087,2113.937,--but not by copyright law.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2113.937,2133.251,"--But there is another way of looking at that, Justice Breyer, of course, which is that the, but for the fact that these individual authors lived in countries that didn't have copyright relations with the United States, they would have the protection of our copyright law and they would have the term of copyright--"
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2133.251,2133.834,Not necessarily.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2175.844,2191.705,--And there is no textual limit in the Copyright Clause that says that Congress cannot provide the same limited term to those categories of works that it provides to other works.
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.722,2195.491,"That's true, but for one text."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2218.107,2218.64,And -- yes.
2011.10-545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2294.154,2302.677,"General, there is something at least at an intuitive level appealing about Mr. Falzone's First Amendment argument."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2312.965,2318.269,"--I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, and I do think -- for a host of reasons."
2011.10-545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2363.248,2365.131,"Well, that's -- that's -- one answer is that Congress has done this before."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2365.131,2372.32,"--But then in 1897, Congress granted an exclusive right in the public performance of musical compositions--"
2011.10-545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.32,2372.937,Right.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2372.937,2376.772,--and made it applicable to all existing copyrights.
2011.10-545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2376.772,2377.206,Okay.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2380.343,2394.0,"Well, that they have done it many times before and it's a process -- I think it reflects -- and -- and the point is no one has thought with respect to any of those significant adjustments of the boundaries that it was an occasion for First Amendment scrutiny."
2011.10-545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2399.571,2403.273,"But it's pertinent under the First Amendment in other areas, right?"
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2423.003,2439.196,"--I think -- because I think there is, once the Court gets into the business of First Amendment analysis, there is no stopping point, because all of the adjustments of the boundaries could have the same kind of effect I think as the musical composition -- show?"
2011.10-545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2439.196,2441.264,"What about Jimmy Hendrix, right?"
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2452.939,2479.089,"What copyright does, by definition, is provide exclusive rights in expression; and so if the First Amendment is triggered whenever copyright provides exclusive rights in expression that it didn't used to provide, then heightened scrutiny will apply any time Congress exercises its copyright power, and what the Court said in Eldred--"
2011.10-545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.089,2479.789,So he is just out of luck?
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2489.481,2497.485,"--Well, of course, under Section 514 they are not out of luck because it has significant protections and accommodations for derivative works."
2011.10-545,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.068,2559.458,"Well, it seems to me what you're saying, and I already gave this answer because originally, I thought I was going to put in my notes, the First Amendment does not apply to the copyright area -- and that just can't be."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2569.266,2575.17,"--We don't think it would have any problem passing intermediate scrutiny, but we don't think intermediate scrutiny ought to apply."
2011.10-545,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2575.17,2583.824,But -- but -- can you -- can you cite me to some -- some authority which says the First Amendment doesn't apply to a copyright?
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2583.824,2584.743,No.
2011.10-545,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2587.145,2588.795,The First Amendment test doesn't apply.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2599.552,2600.668,Yes.
2011.10-545,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2615.594,2642.578,"Even under -- even under rationale basis scrutiny, it seems to me that you run into Justice Breyer's concern that the government interest is vanishingly small when it comes to promoting progress under the Copyright Clause, so that the interest weighed on the other side of the -- the restriction of free speech rights, it's hard to say that that's necessarily going to tip the balance in every case."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2642.578,2671.496,"I think it is going to tip the balance, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- the reason Congress enacted section 514 at the urging of executive branch officials who were charged with trying to ensure that we could integrate ourselves into the international system of copyright protection was that if we didn't have this provision, then we were not going to be taken seriously."
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2679.684,2682.386,"It couldn't have been that -- it must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it?"
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2786.588,2788.206,So -- two points.
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2854.867,2856.967,"Right here, we have the argument."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2868.758,2870.793,"--Well, it doesn't make it millions of times worse."
2011.10-545,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2874.579,2878.566,"Barbara Springer said a million, numbers it in the millions."
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2879.699,2883.617,"--No, we don't have any reason to doubt the -- the aggregate number."
2011.10-545,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2883.617,2887.421,That's presupposing that they are all going to give notice.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2887.421,2892.54,"Well, with respect to reliance parties, that's certainly true."
2011.10-545,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2912.537,2916.941,--Marbury -- the Davis law was passed.
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2923.177,2925.027,--I -- I don't think--
2011.10-545,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2925.027,2926.129,Stop them from circulation?
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2928.748,2929.115,--Yes.
2011.10-545,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3038.387,3063.252,"Doesn't that show at most that retroactive protection can be granted when there is an enormous interest in doing so, namely, the establishment of the uniform copyright system at the beginning of the country, because if Congress had not done that and had said the alternative would be to say things can be copyrighted going forward, then you would have different copyright laws in all of the States?"
2011.10-545,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3063.252,3066.304,"I think -- I don't think so, Justice Alito."

2011.10-545,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3318.716,3324.704,"At the time we joined Berne, there was an appreciation that we deferred the article 18 issue."
2011.10-545,2,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,3328.906,3329.272,--No.
2011.10-545,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3340.797,3349.235,Well there were many people who read article 18 in a different way and Congress was later persuaded that that was right.
2011.10-545,2,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,3349.235,3350.835,--Congress never revisited that finding.
2011.10-545,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.601,3364.743,They -- they found that compliance with article 18 was appropriate for us to become a full member of the international copyright community.
2011.10-545,2,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,3364.743,3370.211,"Congress did not make that finding, and I don't think you can even glean that from the testimony that was presented to Congress."
2011.10-545,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3469.31,3475.797,All this rides on accepting your argument that zero is a limited time.
2011.10-545,2,15983,anthony_t_falzone,,3478.266,3475.797,No.
2011.10-545,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3503.215,3504.067,Would you say it was would required by TRIPS?
