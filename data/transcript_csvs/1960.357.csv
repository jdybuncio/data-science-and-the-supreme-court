1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.668,"-- United States, Petitioner, versus Consolidated Edison Company of New York Incorporated."
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,17.364,21.733,"Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.357,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,34.404,36.719,Are you restricted to Mondays?
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,36.719,42.196,"But, it was last Monday Mr. Justice Douglas that this Court considered the American Automobile Association case."
1960.357,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.587,426.498,A refund of a maximum of $15.
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,426.498,429.673,"Excuse me, a refund of a maximum of $15."
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,524.19,526.325,But he already paid that amount.
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,526.325,526.654,That's right.
1960.357,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,593.746,603.448,"In other words, the -- the Government's position is, that you treat this taxpayer just as though he were a cash basis taxpayer?"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,603.448,605.518,"Well, I'm not sure that that's true."
1960.357,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.518,606.702,Why not?
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,606.702,612.567,"Well, we have the problem -- for example, there might be a prepayment of tax before the tax year which came up."
1960.357,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.088,620.002,"But I'm -- well, I'm -- I'm looking to the stipulated example."
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,620.002,624.928,The -- the tax -- the cash basis taxpayer would report on the method we're now urging as well.
1960.357,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,624.928,625.209,Just the same?
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,625.209,627.13,"Well, that's right, that's right."
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,647.831,648.646,Mr. Jones.
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,648.646,648.682,Yes.
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,648.682,662.5,"If I may ask you, in as much as you have mentioned prepayments, is it your contention that they too must be accrued even though there is no tax yet against which to apply them?"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,662.5,664.313,"No, but it would not be our position."
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,754.665,778.7,"If you -- if you would not contend that one who prepays taxes -- the accrual basis taxpayer must accrued them, then, how can you contend that he must accrue taxes that he disputes does not admit to be due?"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,778.7,783.443,I -- I believe it's our position that payment is a -- is a transcendent fact when a man makes --
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,783.443,789.636,"Well -- there's been payment when there's been prepayment to something that he's part with the money, can he?"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,789.636,790.378,That -- that's true.
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,820.182,836.809,"If I find on your books in the suit where it's to my interest and adverse to your interest and admission by you that you have a liability that you accrue, may I not use that as an admission against interest against you?"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,850.298,856.012,"Well, I -- I believe accounting is -- is designed to meet the realities in situation."
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,890.146,892.586,(Inaudible)
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,892.586,897.206,"Well, I would -- I -- I don't object to the footnote, I object to not accruing."
1960.357,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,897.206,899.018,Could I put something to you?
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,936.649,938.742,I think the Government would not recognize such an estimate.
1960.357,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,938.742,949.079,"In other words, you say it is an all or nothing proposition and not to the -- and no question is opened as to the reason of malice of what the taxpayer undertakes to do in a particular situation."
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,949.079,950.917,"Well, that is not our case."
1960.357,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,950.917,951.362,I know.
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,951.362,953.674,But I -- I -- on the basis of --
1960.357,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,953.674,955.111,But your proposition is the proposition --
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,955.111,959.872,"Well, I think that the argument last Monday has some bearing on this, an accrual system where you put --"
1960.357,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,959.872,961.525,This is a different case from last Monday.
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,961.525,964.556,This is a different case but you are taking a closer to that.
1960.357,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,983.498,985.187,"Well, I just wanted to get your thesis."
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,995.632,996.699,Subject to this prepayment.
1960.357,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,996.699,997.735,Subject to the prepayment.
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,997.735,1004.605,"Well, doesn't that read Section 41 out of the book?"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1004.605,1005.65,I don't believe so.
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1014.947,1024.505,"Last stanza to 51, that if the system of accounting to use does accurately reflect income, the Commissioner has no choice but to accept it."
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1024.505,1031.474,"Well, first let me point out that there is no claim in this case that this is the method used on the taxpayer's books."
1960.357,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1061.206,1069.14,But you -- he did expense it all here in the original years of payment when you say that was proper.
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1069.14,1070.528,"Yes, I say that's proper."
1960.357,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1126.446,1127.491,What page is that?
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1127.491,1131.137,Page 2 of the respondent's brief.
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1342.615,1346.809,"Mr. Jones, may I ask -- may I ask this question."
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1364.778,1371.382,What is involved in his case is the fact that the -- there is a difference in tax rates between the years.
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1395.839,1404.531,"Well, in the tax when -- the taxes were lower in -- in second year instead of higher, why he had -- the reverse would be true, wouldn't it?"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1404.531,1405.871,That's quite true.
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1405.871,1414.796,"Now, may I ask if -- if there is any question -- there is no question I understood you to say about the good faith of the --"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1414.796,1417.901,That's correct.
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1417.901,1422.573,-- would you make any distinctions as to all between whether it was in good faith or not?
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1422.573,1429.679,"Well, I think everybody agrees that there is a danger in the Dixie Pine approach that must be tempered by the good faith."
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1445.353,1446.138,Running what?
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1446.138,1448.406,It's running a big contest with the local authorities about this.
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1448.406,1449.145,"Oh, yes."
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1449.875,1459.421,"Who is to say that when it comes to settling that dispute, it won't cast an eye at what's going to happen when it takes the deduction if the respondent's method is adopted here?"
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1462.139,1464.707,"Well, it won't get anymore than it's entitled to it in the end."
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1464.707,1471.423,"No, but they -- suppose that they -- there is already a perspective lowering of rates where there's a particular reasons for lowering tax liability in this year."
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1471.423,1471.776,I see.
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1471.776,1482.099,"Payment makes a great deal of difference because, if the city authorities do not have any payment that they're worried about, they are not going to press for settlement."
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1499.093,1501.405,"Well, danger to whom?"
1960.357,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1501.405,1517.823,The danger to the federal revenues that they -- that they will be completely free to time their deduction to take maximum advantage if the state authorities are not present.
1960.357,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1517.823,1522.512,Mr. Polk.
1960.357,1,32350,james_k_polk,,1522.512,1526.678,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.357,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2483.324,2484.461,May I ask you Mr. Polk?
1960.357,1,32350,james_k_polk,,2484.461,2487.139,"I meant Dixie Pine, pardon me."
1960.357,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2487.139,2487.76,Mr. Polk.
1960.357,1,32350,james_k_polk,,2487.76,2488.382,"Yes, sir."
1960.357,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2488.382,2500.11,"May I ask you, can there be such a thing under your law, in the state law as a voluntary payment of real property tax?"
1960.357,1,32350,james_k_polk,,2504.711,2508.412,You -- you cannot sue if you find you have overpaid.
1960.357,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2567.269,2582.454,"I suppose you have by far payment, the prepayment made -- put enough money with the tax collector to cover this tax in advance at the time you had to act."
1960.357,1,32350,james_k_polk,,2594.501,2595.937,I think you probably could.
1960.357,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2596.72,2598.223,"Well, I'm taking out (Inaudible)"
1960.357,1,32350,james_k_polk,,2606.861,2606.962,Yes.
1960.357,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2606.962,2614.936,"But if I make a deposit to secure a debt or something of that kind which is not include the payment, then, I don't have to admit a payment."
1960.357,1,32350,james_k_polk,,2614.936,2616.057,That is correct.
1960.357,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2616.19,2618.89,(Inaudible) did you make payment or did you make a deposit (Voice Overlap)?
1960.357,1,32350,james_k_polk,,2618.89,2621.377,We -- we claim it was a deposit.
1960.357,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2719.994,2723.43,Mr. Jones.
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2723.43,2734.808,"Well, I -- I can agree with Mr. Polk that if this payment of tax liability was a deposit of tax, then he is correct and the Government is wrong."
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2775.115,2788.823,"When you say the record, I want to know Mr. Jones what extent determination of this case turn on a precise, an exact appreciation of the New York law with reference to this tax?"
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2788.823,2800.777,"Well, I don't believe that it got to that because I don't believe despite the -- the attempt of respondent here, there really is an issue under New York law that this is a full payment of tax which extinguishes the liability and subject to refund."
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2803.837,2810.833,"What you're saying is that -- that as a matter of New York law, it's clear for federal purposes what this is."
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2819.785,2826.328,"Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I think that it is true in our approach that we must find whether there is a payment or not."
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2834.329,2838.581,"And that turn on how New York conceive this, is that right?"
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2838.581,2839.14,Yes.
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2839.59,2845.085,"Well, that turns -- well, that turns on the first statutes in how the Court has construed it, is that right?"
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2845.085,2846.22,"Yes, yes."
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2850.886,2852.948,I'm -- I'm not contesting anything you say.
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2874.611,2874.869,I -- I won't --
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2874.869,2885.889,"If you say -- if you say that the statute is quite clear, there has been no litigation under it, there'd be doubt cash on it or no practice that looks the other way as that."
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2885.889,2886.203,"Well, that --"
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2886.203,2887.221,Can you say all that?
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2887.221,2891.286,The only litigation I'm aware is awarding interest to the taxpayer.
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2905.448,2908.331,"Well, you now should be federal standard."
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2909.783,2910.328,"Well, we are getting --"
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2910.328,2911.281,(Voice overlap) -- my question.
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2911.281,2911.609,Well --
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2911.609,2920.674,Do I have to decide whether this -- whether the payment is a general federal concept or does one revert to the New York situation?
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2920.674,2924.468,"Well, I -- I -- New York cannot call it a deposit if it doesn't have the earmarks of the deposit."
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2924.468,2927.122,"I understand that, can capriciously but --"
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2927.122,2927.562,And --
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2927.562,2935.168,"-- but the incidence, that legal consequences and incident that New York may attach, they make a difference."
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2935.168,2936.123,"That's correct, sir."
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2936.123,2937.995,And you say that -- I even bother about that.
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2940.072,2940.673,I will (Voice Overlap) --
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2940.673,2942.2,May be on the day like this.
1960.357,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2942.2,2942.35,Mr --
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2942.35,2944.242,I -- I will walk in you independent reexaminations.
1960.357,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2944.242,2945.085,Alright.
1960.357,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2945.085,2958.026,"Mr. Jones, it would help me if you could give your idea of when this tax became fixed in fact and amount."
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2961.362,2967.566,It -- it is -- it is my view and the view of the Government that the full tax became due -- due and paid in the tax year.
1960.357,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2967.566,2969.065,"Well, that is the one I want to know."
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2971.821,2973.848,I believe it became fixed in law in amount there.
1960.357,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2984.614,2988.866,"The case turns on the answer to that question, doesn't it?"
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2988.866,2989.257,Yes.
1960.357,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2992.309,2995.541,How do you say it became fixed in amount in 1949 --
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2995.541,2995.948,He --
1960.357,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2995.948,2998.749,-- at $100 when it -- when it never -- never was $100?
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,2998.749,3012.954,"Well, that extinguished his liability for tax -- for a tax of $100 shown on the books and he could never be sued for that and if the contest had been allowed to go on forever without being settled, his tax liability for the year was paid."
1960.357,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3018.849,3023.229,How could the tax payer contest to this otherwise (Inaudible)?
1960.357,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3023.229,3031.009,"Well, let me answer it this way Mr. Justice Harlan that -- that there it -- let us take the taxpayer's word that there is no other method under the laws of New York."
1960.357,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3031.009,3032.124,"Well, there isn't any doubt about that."
