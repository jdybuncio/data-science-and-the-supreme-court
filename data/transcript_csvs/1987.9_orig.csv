1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,54.593,57.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.636,193.107,"Mr. Bruce, I take it from the way you're pronouncing the word that Louisiana's pronounced it Chandeleur Sound even though the last syllable is spelled L-E-U-R."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,193.107,197.781,"Yes, sir."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,222.857,227.117,(Inaudible) this is Mississippi Sound or not?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,227.117,227.719,"No, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.305,247.54,Why does that -- why does Chandeleur Sound come into the case?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,247.54,253.257,"Well, because the Master in his report was attempting to delineate the coastline of Mississippi."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,257.281,261.245,"Well, why didn't they consider it?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,261.245,262.941,He felt that he was foreclosed by this --
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.941,263.098,Yes.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,263.098,264.782,-- Court's previous opinion from.
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.782,269.461,You have to address our -- address our opinion then.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,278.139,278.947,"Well, we think, Your Honor --"
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.947,280.719,Isn't that right?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,280.719,281.835,"I -- I would agree with you, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.652,286.797,"Well, tell -- tell me why the Master was wrong in that regard."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,286.797,297.232,"Well, I think first of all in the opinion, the Court noted that this was a very narrow question involving only Mississippi Sound or at least that's the way I read the very beginning of this opinion."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,306.377,306.653,(Voice Overlap).
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,306.653,308.576,-- inland waters.
1987.9_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,308.576,310.14,Which Mississippi rejected?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,310.14,318.621,"Yes, Your Honor, because we felt that the offer was less than what we were entitled to as a matter of law."
1987.9_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.621,319.584,"Yes, yes."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,319.584,331.175,And of course the question as to the status of Chandeleur Sound was raised before the previous Master and was presented to this Court under the claim of a straight baseline.
1987.9_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,332.428,340.673,"In this proceeding, when did the State first raised the Chandeleur Sound issue?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,340.673,347.501,"Your Honor, that would been back, I believe, in early 1983 prior to the time the Master had submitted his previous recommendation."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.162,437.226,"Why -- why is it whether the Master was right or wrong in saying that the remand was a narrow one, everybody agrees that you're going to have to finish up the case anyway."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,445.7,447.572,"Well, we think that there are some serious problems --"
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.572,449.138,"What you did -- all right, that that's --"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,449.138,449.628,-- with the act --
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.628,452.261,Isn't that issue that we have before us?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,456.996,458.505,"No, Your Honor, he was not."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,461.395,463.164,"It was one of the issues, isn't it?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,469.93,478.285,"Well, yes, Your Honor, that would be one of the issues for the Court to consider in deciding whether to affirm the report of the Special Master."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.285,478.897,Yes.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,478.897,480.98,And if -- if --
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.98,482.376,Can you object to what he did?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,482.995,483.019,Yes.
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.019,484.173,-- the Master was wrong?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,484.173,485.036,"We do, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.629,487.49,"And you're going to argue that, I suppose."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,487.49,489.459,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,561.976,564.856,Between Cat Island and Isle of Petit?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,564.856,567.798,"Yes, sir."
1987.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,586.677,590.879,Was that question squarely involved in that case?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,606.788,617.586,"I -- I think that could be an argument that would be made to oppose as, however, they issue presented to the Court well as the location of the boundary between Mississippi and Louisiana."
1987.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,731.856,740.679,"Mr. Bruce, let me ask you a question if I may about the map which I think is -- yes, it's the one in Alaska's amicus brief."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.552,749.93,From Alaska?
1987.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.93,755.256,Take -- take a look at where it shows Chandeleur Sound.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,760.404,767.331,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, and that was decided, of course, in Louisiana versus Mississippi in 1960 as well the Court held that was the mainland of Louisiana."
1987.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.392,775.401,Thank you.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,775.401,797.731,"In addition to that, those problems we feel that the Master confused the terms “boundary” and “coastline"", of course, the two are distinct, the boundary is located three miles seaward of the coastline, the coastline being define as the limited inland waters and the -- or water mark along that part of the coast and direct contact with the open Sea."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.458,822.689,"Mr. Bruce, can I ask you a question?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,822.689,823.196,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.196,832.882,"The map to -- as I understand that the lines -- the mark three from Petit Bois to East Ship Island that's not in dispute, right?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,832.882,833.558,"No, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.558,833.854,They're not.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,833.854,834.278,That is not.
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.278,840.363,And how about the lines mark seven from West Ship Island down to the Isle of Petit?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,844.264,845.329,"That's right, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.597,860.8,"And there -- and from that point, how do you get from there to Isle of Petit or how do you get from -- what do you think the Master should have done?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,871.268,876.729,"From the eastern tip of Ship Island, we would have close that down to the Chandeleur Islands."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.729,877.749,I understand that.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,882.883,883.876,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.876,886.779,"But I'm asking you, where do you go from there under your view of the case?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,886.779,894.484,"Mississippi would be entitled only to that area, north of its lateral boundary with Louisiana."
1987.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.484,905.063,"What Justice Stevens asked you about a line that comes down to six, goes down from East Ship Island to the northern most of the Chandeleur Islands, and then, where does the line goes, it goes westward from there?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,905.063,906.261,"Oh, I see."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.798,927.191,And you would then --
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,927.191,927.48,(Inaudible)
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.48,933.334,-- contend that -- that all of Chandeleur Sound that shown on this map is part of Mississippi?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,933.334,933.825,"No, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.464,942.65,Another north of the line of number one?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,942.65,945.821,"No, that would be north of line number five, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.984,952.764,"That's still the question, how do you get from the northern tip of Chandeleur Islands to the line number five?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,957.5,959.803,"Your Honor, I'm -- I'm not sure I -- I understand --"
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.803,962.088,I -- I have not been able to understand.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,968.59,969.178,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.178,970.77,"And then, where does it go?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,970.77,976.761,The -- the coastline would follow the outer fringe of the Chandeleur Islands --
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.761,976.986,Get down to the south --
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,976.986,978.724,-- down to the Mississippi Delta.
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.724,980.816,Down to the south tip of Chandeleur Islands.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,980.816,981.312,"Yes, sir, and it --"
1987.9_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.312,982.01,Whose coastline?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,983.365,983.952,"No, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.926,984.951,"Well, that --"
1987.9_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.951,987.206,"Well, what he's asking is where is Mississippi's coastline?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,998.804,999.642,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.253,1005.904,Down over to one?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1005.904,1007.816,That's correct.
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.816,1017.2,You would close Chandeleur -- Chandeleur Sound from the south end of Chandeleur Islands over to the Delta?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1017.2,1017.776,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.776,1023.696,And then -- and then Chandeleur Sound is divided between Mississippi and Louisiana.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1023.696,1026.641,"The northern part of it would be, yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1026.641,1030.955,"And what about the southern part of Chandeleur Sound, is that all Mississippi?"
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.955,1032.085,No that's Louisiana.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1032.085,1032.759,"No, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.643,1042.869,(Inaudible)
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1042.869,1044.103,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.103,1056.461,"So, what's in dispute then is the area to the west of line six and north of line five and one and south of Cat Island and West Ship Island."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1056.461,1056.913,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.913,1058.719,That's -- that area is in dispute.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1065.008,1066.94,"Well, I don't think that he has decided what State it's in."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.094,1071.897,"Well, it has -- do you think he has decided it's not in it --"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1071.897,1071.918,Yes.
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.918,1080.564,"-- and he has to set for the purpose of this case, the -- the border should be lined -- you know what he's -- what he's drawn."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1086.714,1094.824,It appears from what the Master said that he was fixing our boundary and as that term is used and the term coastline is used that would limit State as to how far it go.
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.325,1111.86,That's a long finger of water that you contend is land.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1112.412,1112.976,I'm sorry.
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1113.378,1114.109,Yes.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1114.72,1131.349,"The problems that this would raise also under the decree -- a 1981 decree in Louisiana, the Louisiana case, the Court awarded to Louisiana all of the land west to the closing line to Chandeleur Sound subject to the location of the lateral boundary."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.349,1134.946,"Let me ask you another question, if I may because finally getting this."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1142.283,1142.558,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.558,1146.834,"That this particular area should have been part of your State, Mississippi."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1146.834,1146.933,"Yes, sir."
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.933,1161.983,"The Master rejected that and you did not file an exception to that holding of the Master and we affirmed -- we -- and so, isn't the law of the case that you are not entitled to this because it was raised and was rejected before the Master --"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1161.983,1162.151,I suppose the --
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.151,1162.763,-- and a prior appeal?
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1162.763,1164.843,-- Court could view it that way.
1987.9_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1253.904,1259.444,"But if you lose on that, you could still bring another original action, can't you?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1259.444,1268.283,"Your Honor, we would feel that if we lost after being referred back to the Master that another original action would not be permissible."
1987.9_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1285.535,1288.355,"I can understand you second point, not your first."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1288.355,1290.278,"All right, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1290.278,1299.307,"If the Master chooses not to act on Chandeleur Sound, how -- how you lost as of this point?"
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1299.307,1302.375,If the Master --
1987.9_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.375,1309.607,"I think -- I think Justice Blackmun is asking, if you lost on that point here, not if you lost after it was referred back to the Master."
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1314.621,1318.755,I think that -- that would be questionable as to whether we could or not.
1987.9_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1365.018,1367.689,They certainly would do it if we ask him to.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1367.689,1368.245,Your Honor?
1987.9_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1368.245,1370.062,He certainly would do it if we ask him to.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1370.062,1374.217,He certainly would.
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.217,1377.482,May I ask another question with the map because I'm intrigued by this.
1987.9_orig,0,29183,jim_r_bruce,,1411.368,1415.341,You mean why would Mississippi be entitled of anything greater than what the United States has offered?
1987.9_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.341,1415.817,"No, no."

1987.9_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2213.645,2214.234,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.17,2226.889,And is not true that there has not yet been a judicial determination as to whether Chandeleur Sound is or is not inland waters?
1987.9_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2226.889,2228.275,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2228.275,2245.918,"So is it not also true that there is a possibility that if we knew all the answers to these questions, that they (a) it is inland waters and (b) if it is, the line really would be incorrect if we simply affirm because if it's inland waters, Mississippi presumably is entitled to portion north of the Louisiana border, isn't it?"
1987.9_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2245.918,2249.759,"Your Honor, if there's a problem in that regard extends from Mississippi's original allegation --"

1987.9_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.494,2256.446,-- maybe they goofed up procedurally and they may have to -- to standby what they alleged.You maybe dead right or (Voice Overlap) --

1987.9_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2263.235,2283.927,"And if I were as a member of this Court concerned about that and wanted to protect their right to proceed, what is the best way to do it to make clear to the Master that the line isn't final for that purpose or to go ahead and remand it?"
1987.9_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2283.927,2290.923,"Your Honor, I think that what this Court should do is simply accept the Special Master's report and tell him to go forward and draw the line."
1987.9_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2310.459,2316.86,"Well, that seemed easier to me frankly either to remand it or to say the line isn't final."
1987.9_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2316.86,2324.834,"The problem again, Your Honor, with a remand is that we will be giving the Master, we'll have true lack of direction in terms of the reference."

1987.9_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2387.839,2389.274,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.274,2395.843,"If that were true, they wouldn't get anything more and Louisiana might end up with at least a doubtful claim, as the one that you're talking about their boundary?"
1987.9_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2395.843,2396.206,Yes.

1987.9_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2407.869,2409.399,I'm sure that they would be interested --
1987.9_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.399,2409.668,Right.

1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.726,2549.815,You claim --
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2549.815,2550.286,-- it's true.
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.286,2553.311,-- that your line was those barrier islands.
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2553.311,2554.429,Initially the --
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.429,2555.134,Isn't that right?
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2555.134,2555.983,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.983,2565.09,And despite the fact that you knew the United States had made a deal with Louisiana recognizing Louisiana's right to some portion of Chandeleur Sound.
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2565.09,2567.476,"Oh, I think that's probably giving us more credit than we deserve."
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.763,2571.217,I would think that --

1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.748,2572.269,-- I would think that could have --
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2572.269,2573.434,-- quite and wants to have --
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.434,2576.443,-- been rather impressive.
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2576.443,2577.518,That's correct Your Honor.
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.147,2581.885,What error?
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2581.885,2594.54,"The -- the question there as to where the line should be and that it should go along with the -- the islands or should it be a closing line for all Chandeleur Sound, that issue was presented to the Master."
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.54,2598.403,Just on this latest remand?
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2598.403,2599.127,"No, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2605.327,2605.606,"Well, it wasn't in your --"
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2605.606,2606.417,-- in a brief form back in 1983.
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.417,2610.055,-- it wasn't in your -- it wasn't in your complaint.
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2610.055,2611.417,"No, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.743,2614.698,When did you first put it in the case?
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2614.698,2625.351,"It would have been in the early part of 1983, the Master makes note of -- of the fact that we did raise that issue as to the status of Chandeleur Sound as well in one of his footnotes."
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.351,2627.074,In this report or in the prior --
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2627.074,2630.574,"In this -- this report, I believe, it's on page 24."
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.98,2639.158,But it hasn't been raised at the time we last remanded to the Special Master.
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2639.158,2645.08,"Well, not at the time that you referred the matter to him originally, that's correct."
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.694,2646.952,I see.
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2646.952,2648.326,-- except --
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.326,2648.582,The original --
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2648.582,2649.405,-- for submission of the --
1987.9_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2649.405,2650.344,-- submission of the remand.
1987.9_orig,2,29183,jim_r_bruce,,2650.344,2654.016,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.9_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.531,2742.06,Mr. Bruce do you understand the Government's settlement offer to be still open?
