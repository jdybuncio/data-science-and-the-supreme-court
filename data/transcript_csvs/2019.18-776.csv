2019.18-776,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.4,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-776, Guerrero-Lasprilla versus Ovalles and Attorney General Barr."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,11.4,25.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section (2)(D) provides for review of questions of law decided by the Board of Immigration Appeals."
2019.18-776,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,150.28,192.08,"Well, before you get to that, I wonder if you have not read too much into the government's statement that a -- that under their theory, it would be permissible for a court to review not just whether the -- the -- the Board articulated the right theory but whether it actually used the right theory. When I read that, I thought what they were saying was that review would extend to those perhaps rare situations where, although it was in response to your argument that if the -- if the -- if the right standard was merely mentioned, that would be sufficient."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,214.76,245.28,"Well, as Your Honor suggests, I think the government does agree that if the -- the decision of the Board on the face invokes the correct standard, but a reasonable reader of that decision would appreciate that that standard was not used to actually decide the case, that there would be judicial review over that. Once the government agrees with that, which I think they must, otherwise it's judicial review in substance -- or not in substance at all, only in form, once the government agrees with that, they haven't actually articulated how that test differs from applying law to fact. And our point is that --"
2019.18-776,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,245.28,246.76,"Well, I think it's like a sham."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,259.16,259.88,"Oh, well, Your Honor, I --"
2019.18-776,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,259.88,261.08,-- Mr. Liu can correct that.
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,261.08,262.48,-- I think a few things about that.
2019.18-776,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,286.2,306.76,"But there's a big difference between your two positions, and it has to do with the application of -- of the legal standard to the facts where the -- the legal standard requires a considerable exercise of judgment, as it does with equitable tolling, where you have to determine whether there's due diligence or exceptional circumstances."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,309.96,339.96,"Well, Your Honor, yes, but I think to the extent there's a difference, if there is a difference, it's a difference in degree, but the government doesn't provide a way to distinguish between when the degree is sufficiently enough to say that the standard wasn't actually used. But the other problem with this is, if that is the test that the government advances, it has the effect of merging the underlying merits of the inquiry with the jurisdictional analysis. The end result would be there would be jurisdiction if the decision of the Board was really, really wrong, but not if it was a little bit wrong."
2019.18-776,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,346.12,356.88,"Well, suppose we -- we take their principal argument, which is that this applies -- the only thing that can be reviewed is a pure question of law, all right? That's a clear rule."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,358.0,361.68,"Yes, and I don't think they actually stick with that, but that would be a clear -- a clear rule."
2019.18-776,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,362.28,362.56,Okay.
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,376.0,376.84,So there --
2019.18-776,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,376.84,380.16,"It's very, very -- it's very slight, right?"
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,380.16,381.08,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2019.18-776,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,396.2,396.28,Yeah.
2019.18-776,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,396.44,399.24,But those are all made under a substantial evidence standard.
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,408.28,409.88,"I don't think it would necessarily be rare, Your Honor."
2019.18-776,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,437.08,437.56,Could I take you off --
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,437.56,438.16,-- held in St. Cyr.
2019.18-776,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,438.16,438.4,I'm sorry.
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,509.04,511.0,"So, Your Honor, a few responses to that."
2019.18-776,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,548.88,552.44,"Well, I wasn't even talking about using the Lakeridge framework here."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,585.96,599.04,"So, Your Honor, I -- I agree insofar as what the Board is doing is finding historic facts or finding credibility or adding historic facts to make other judgments about historic facts or predictions about future facts."
2019.18-776,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,664.72,665.24,I was thinking --
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,665.24,666.64,-- under Section 2(D).
2019.18-776,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,666.64,704.76,"-- about this in similar terms to Justice Kagan, but what I realize gave me some clarity was a statement that my colleague made in a case involving the exceptional circumstances of diligence and where he said it's a question of law, because let's take the cruel -- cruelty issue. Whether a punch is cruel or a knife wound is or a threat to family is, all of those are facts that can be found by the BIA or a finder of fact."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,713.16,714.28,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
2019.18-776,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,734.48,761.28,"Well, but, I -- I mean, you know, is a punch cruel? I mean, obviously, in the -- in the abstract, it could be anything to -- however soft it is, to the extent it's an offense to dignity or, you know, I mean, isn't -- wouldn't one thing to do if you're trying to figure that out to be look at the range of legal decisions, determinations, that said this conduct is cruel, this conduct is not, this conduct is cruel, and I don't know that that makes it any easier to characterize."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,761.28,772.96,"Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, the Court has found that it is relatively easy, although there is always line drawing, but the courts are well equipped to be able to distinguish between where historic fact ends and legal conclusions begin."
2019.18-776,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.64,784.76,But don't -- we do --
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,784.76,786.68,-- agree those --
2019.18-776,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,786.68,836.76,"-- we do know that Congress meant to restrict the court of appeals' review of orders of removal of criminal aliens, so that was Congress's purpose when it wanted the limited -- limited review in -- in the case of removal of criminal aliens. And you -- you -- your position is only fact disputes are reviewable, no law, application of law to undisputed facts, only straight out fact disputes. And how often do straight out fact disputes come to court of appeals? Because usually facts are decided in the first instance."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,836.76,859.68,"Well, Your Honor, I can say that factual disputes are very often entirely dispositive of removal proceedings. It's true that those cases may be less often appealed because of the substantial or the standard of review that courts of appeals apply, but I can just provide a few examples of factual issues that are often dispositive. For example, an individual might claim that they were born in the United States, so, in fact, a U.S. citizen."
2019.18-776,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,891.64,898.36,"Mr. Hughes, along similar lines, the question we have here is reasonable diligence."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,931.64,934.48,"As Your Honor suggests, I -- I -- our principal argument is to resist the premise."
2019.18-776,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,986.4,1010.36,"I think I did everything I could to avoid this question in that case, and I think you know that. But I -- I -- I -- I guess I'm just trying to disentangle what would be available for us to review legally versus what would then be left to the Board, the discretionary decision, if, in fact, we review the case for abuse of discretion in our legal review."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1010.36,1015.0,"Well, Your Honor, where I think abuse of discretion comes in is not at the question of -- of diligence."
2019.18-776,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1088.32,1132.12,"Mr. Hughes, I mean, I think the question that Justice Gorsuch asked is a very broad one, and it's -- it's with respect not just to the diligence but to all these other questions that you think should end up being reviewable, like the ones that I mentioned, which sound awfully factual, you know, extreme cruelty, whether there is unusual hardship, whether there's changed country conditions. All of those are reviewed generally with a highly deferential standard. And -- and that suggests that -- that -- that -- that everybody's aware that most of the work is being done at the factual level and the application of the legal standard at the end is -- is -- is not where the action is."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1154.68,1163.2,"Well, Your Honor, to the extent those questions, as you say, are driven principally by the facts and the legal work is only doing a little tail at the end, then that would be true on appeal as well."
2019.18-776,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1234.48,1243.32,"On the statutory history point that Justice Kagan raised, St. Cyr involves what the Court characterized as pure questions of law."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1271.16,1272.08,"A few reasons, Your Honor."
2019.18-776,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1356.88,1358.8,But they said that was because it was redundant.
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1358.8,1376.8,"Well, that was in the conference report, Your Honor, and if this Court is going to look to the conference report, where I think this is an area to be skeptical because what Congress actually did is far more probative, but if the Court looks to the conference report, I think you look a couple sentences later where the Court -- where the conference report says what happens with mixed questions, you review to the extent there are legal elements."
2019.18-776,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1385.16,1389.88,Can you succinctly tell me what the questions of law are in your two cases?
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1389.88,1390.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-776,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1403.04,1413.92,"I -- I phrased it differently in my own head, whether the existence of adverse circuit precedent serves as an obstacle to filing a timely motion to reopen."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1413.92,1416.52,"That's -- I think that's just a broader way of saying the same question, yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-776,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1418.08,1418.44,All right.
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1418.44,1419.2,That is yes.
2019.18-776,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1419.2,1420.12,And Mr. Ovalles?
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1420.12,1422.56,"There, I think one -- there are a few questions."
2019.18-776,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1462.2,1465.88,"Mr. Hughes, you haven't spoken much about the presumption of reviewability."
2019.18-776,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1483.24,1484.88,"I think it's -- it's both, Your Honor."
2019.18-776,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1518.48,1523.44,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liu."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1523.44,1545.08,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress used the words ""questions of law"" in Section 1252(a)(2)(D), it meant questions of law only, not questions of fact and not mixed questions of law and fact. We know that from the text of the provision itself, which doesn't mention questions of fact or mixed questions."
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1665.92,1666.16,But the --
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1666.16,1667.04,-- provisions differently.
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1667.04,1685.44,"-- the original version of the statute had ""pure questions of law."" And to pick up on your point on the statutory history, then that's deleted, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Cohn testifies and says a mixed question of law is in effect a question with two parts, the legal part and the factual part."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1693.36,1694.32,Right.
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1694.32,1696.08,Was that correct?
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1696.08,1707.68,"We do think the legal part is reviewable, but I think it's important to understand what we think that legal part to be. That legal part is the same part this Court identified in Lakeridge."
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1732.52,1740.44,"Mr. Liu, I -- I -- I'd like to poke at that just a little bit and -- and return to Justice Alito's question at the beginning of argument."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1740.44,1741.04,Sure.
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1741.04,1756.84,"Is it the government's position that only pure questions of law are reviewable, or is it also the government's position that there can be some applications that are so egregious that they would rise to the level of being questions of law?"
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1756.84,1760.08,It's the former position. So our view is that only pure questions.
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1760.08,1760.24,Okay.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1773.04,1773.52,Right.
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1773.52,1802.2,"-- and say, yes, they have recited the correct legal standard. And no matter how unreasonable, no matter how crazy the application is, we have to provide a judicial imprimatur to that decision. Does that -- does that cause any concerns for you, for the government, and what about the clear statement rule and the idea of the presumption of reviewability here and the separation of powers concerns that Justice Kagan pointed out that undergird it?"
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1802.2,1804.56,I guess I would just make maybe three points.
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1843.64,1844.44,"Well, hold on."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1859.96,1861.12,"No, I --"
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1861.12,1862.12,-- nail you down on that.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1862.12,1864.8,-- I want to give you -- maybe I can illustrate this with an example.
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1865.04,1865.16,"No, no."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1868.84,1874.08,"The -- the -- in our view, the Court can never review an application of law to fact."
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1874.08,1874.56,Okay.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1875.08,1875.72,Never review that.
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1899.84,1900.76,I understand.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1900.76,1903.2,-- to know that the Board has used the wrong standard.
2019.18-776,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1903.2,1919.16,"Suppose the -- the issue is whether there were exceptional circumstances that might justify equitable tolling, and let's say the -- the alien in question was in a coma. What would happen there? No judicial -- and they say, well, that's not an exceptional circumstance."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1919.16,1932.32,"Well, I -- I -- I think to the extent the question is, as a categorical matter, is being in a coma an exceptional circumstance, that could be a question of law. I mean, take -- take this -- this Court's decision in Helton versus Florida."
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1933.88,1946.8,"Mr. Liu, if you -- if you -- if you accept that, haven't you given up the ghost? Then we're just into deciding whether the application given these facts is or isn't reasonable diligence as a matter of law."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1946.8,1950.36,"I -- I -- I don't think so. I mean, I think in the -- in the --"
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1950.36,1951.92,Why are comas special?
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1951.92,1954.44,"Well, they -- they very well might not be."
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1969.68,1970.12,So how is --
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1970.12,1970.28,So when --
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1970.28,1988.84,"-- that different from the case here, where at least one of the plaintiffs says binding circuit precedent made it unreasonable for me to file a motion to reopen and the Fifth Circuit said, no, you could have filed it earlier. That seems to me to be a pure legal question --"
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1988.84,1989.6,And -- and --
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1989.6,1990.8,-- under your definition.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1990.8,1994.52,-- and we don't understand the -- the Fifth Circuit to have even reached that issue.
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2000.32,2000.56,Well --
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.56,2014.72,"Then -- then, look, what I think everyone is trying to ask you, is Hurricane Katrina blows the courthouse away, okay, the standard is you have to file within 15 days."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2046.8,2048.0,There's no review.
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.36,2073.6,"No review, but, my goodness, if we look at the cases, I mean, then you've taken from the attorneys for the person who's trying to get review any kind of check through appeal on the action of a district judge. Now that's a -- I think it's pretty hard to find statutes that do that in a country that has a presumption of judicial review."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2097.12,2105.04,"I think to determine what is reviewable and what is not under our position, you look at the type of analysis that's required to evaluate that claim."
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2115.4,2115.68,How is the --
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2115.68,2116.32,-- a particular --
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2116.32,2123.72,"-- how is the Katrina hypo different from the coma hypothetical? You said one's reviewable and one's not reviewable, I think, if I heard you correctly."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2123.72,2136.16,"Well, I -- I think it's because, to answer the Katrina hypo, we would need to know more about the circumstances surrounding the storm and the particular circumstances of the litigant in trying to overcome --"
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.16,2140.6,What would you like to know? I'll tell you the courthouse is in Florida. (Laughter.)
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2140.6,2141.36,"Well, but this is --"
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.36,2147.2,"And the litigant, by the way, has never been able to walk more than one mile and his car has been blown up."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2147.2,2147.48,Right.
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.2,2153.48,Oh --
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2153.48,2157.24,And -- and -- and it's because I need those facts to answer the question.
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.24,2157.36,You do?
2019.18-776,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2157.36,2185.72,"I thought that your -- your answer was that at some point the factual mistake becomes so egregious that it reflects a misunderstanding of what exceptional means, rather than a misapplication of fact, which, correct me if I'm wrong, because that does lead into Justice Gorsuch's concern that, you know, you've kind of given up the game because then it's just a question of how exceptional is the fact."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2185.72,2185.96,Right.
2019.18-776,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.24,2190.84,"Which begins to look, once you say that, it begins to look like your standard application of law to fact."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2190.84,2191.56,Right.
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.56,2216.76,"Well, all right, here is the difficulty."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2314.6,2315.4,Right.
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2318.92,2321.68,The text says questions of law.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2330.2,2345.32,"I -- I -- I -- I think -- I think that the best reference point for what questions of law means is 1254(2), which -- which this Court itself has applied in a pretty principled way to distinguish pure questions of law from mixed questions."
2019.18-776,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2350.4,2358.28,"Now the phrase ""questions of law"" is like the term ""jurisdiction."" It's used -- it means lots of different things."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2372.64,2373.68,I think --
2019.18-776,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2373.68,2375.04,"Anyway, that's just a --"
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2375.04,2380.72,-- I -- I think it's fair to look at the context in which Congress looked -- wrote this statute.
2019.18-776,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2392.2,2392.56,Yeah.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2436.48,2444.08,"And I think they would have wanted that because their goal all along, since 1996, is to -- is to expedite the removal of criminal aliens."
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2444.44,2445.12,But why did this --
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2445.12,2450.76,"But they expedite it, though, by -- by moving it to the court of appeals and taking the district court out, so that -- that --"
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2450.76,2453.64,"Well, I think -- I think that's half the equation."
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2454.88,2460.2,"I mean, that's a year or more, you know, in many cases that's cut out by doing that."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2463.12,2466.48,But I think -- I think that's only half -- half the equation.
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2469.6,2469.88,Right.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2469.88,2472.36,-- that the courts of appeals would have to engage in.
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2473.28,2479.88,"On that -- on that -- on the context point that you were just referencing to, what about 1252(b)(9)? That seems important."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2499.16,2499.44,"Well, I --"
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2499.44,2504.48,Everything else is a question of law and thus reviewable when you combine your stat -- this statute with (b)(9).
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2504.48,2513.36,"I think (b)(9), which refers to all questions of law and fact, is just a natural way of referring to all three categories."
2019.18-776,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2524.56,2524.76,Mr. Liu --
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2524.76,2525.6,I think that's --
2019.18-776,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2525.6,2526.16,I'm sorry.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2526.16,2532.64,"I was just going to say I think that's -- that's all the zipper clause is doing, and I think the language there fits naturally with our argument."
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2532.64,2541.16,"Mr. Liu, there is no question that we have a presumption in favor of judicial review, correct?"
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2541.16,2542.04,Yes.
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2542.04,2550.6,Now you said that's a way of divining congressional intent. I don't actually think that because I think it's much broader than that.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2617.6,2623.04,We don't -- we don't read that line in St. Cyr to be referring to the application of law to fact.
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2629.88,2631.32,"It begs -- it begs the question, doesn't it?"
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2631.32,2631.96,"Well, I -- I don't think --"
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2631.96,2632.48,Because you don't --
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2632.48,2633.08,-- I don't think so.
2019.18-776,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2653.6,2654.56,Except --
2019.18-776,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2654.56,2659.48,"Mr. Liu, I think Justice Kagan had a question on the table."
2019.18-776,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2659.48,2661.6,Have you finished?
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2661.6,2662.08,Yep.
2019.18-776,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2663.84,2671.2,Here's one way to look at this case: The text gets neither side all the way home; can't possibly.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2711.52,2716.6,"Well, to -- to answer your question directly, we do think it's -- it's a presumption of congressional intent."
2019.18-776,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2731.76,2733.08,"Well, I take that point."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2760.92,2767.92,"Well, I -- I think at the end of the day, the presumption, if we know anything about it, it's -- it's not a -- a sort of magic words requirement."
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2799.52,2806.64,"But suppose that you take that presumption, very interesting and deep question that I have, and maybe you have a view on this."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2844.32,2845.36,And I think the separation of --
2019.18-776,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.36,2845.96,And what do you think?
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2845.96,2850.08,I don't think the separation of powers is -- is a concern for us.
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2855.76,2860.24,"Well, I -- I don't think that quite gets to Justice Breyer's question, in fairness."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2882.4,2890.0,I don't dispute any of that. What -- what I would say is St. Cyr cashed out all those concerns in its constitutional avoidance holding --
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2890.0,2890.32,Okay.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2895.4,2898.68,"That's -- that's fair enough, Justice Gorsuch, absolutely."
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2917.4,2919.16,But Congress knew about this.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2940.96,2945.24,"Well, I mean, I -- I think that -- that language would have been equally clear."
2019.18-776,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3150.36,3161.04,"Mr. Liu, on that, the way I -- I worked my way through it, and I want to give you a shot at it, is to say that when we have the abuse of discretion standard review, we often mean really two things."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3198.76,3207.48,"Well, I think that inquiry is still -- requires a -- a great deal of exercise of judgment on behalf of whoever is conducting the inquiry."
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3260.64,3261.12,You've mentioned --
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3261.12,3261.28,-- aliens got.
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3261.28,3263.96,-- St. Cyr and Congress was just responding to that.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3273.28,3276.84,"Well, only -- only four courts of appeals did."
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3280.76,3285.44,But Congress indicated it was -- at least a committee indicated awareness of those decisions.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3285.44,3290.2,I don't think that's right. If you look at the passage of -- of the conference report on which Petitioners rely --
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3290.2,3291.28,"Well, put aside that."
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3297.24,3298.12,Yeah.
2019.18-776,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3298.12,3299.16,-- in that interim.
2019.18-776,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3299.16,3300.52,Four of them had.
2019.18-776,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3330.52,3334.12,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Hughes."
2019.18-776,2,56059,paul_w_hughes,,3334.12,3345.96,"Thank you, Your Honor. I'll -- I'll be brief. Our -- our first point is that because Congress created judicial review, that review must, in fact, be substantive."
2019.18-776,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3492.16,3493.56,"Thank you, counsel."
