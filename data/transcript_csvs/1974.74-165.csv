1974.74-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.497,"We'll hear argument first this morning in 74-165 and the related cases, Blanchette and Others against Connecticut."
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,24.361,27.133,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-165,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,529.472,531.878,There is nothing here from that Special Court?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,531.878,534.918,"Nothing here, the Special Court opinion is available"
1974.74-165,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,534.918,535.272,Yes.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,535.272,538.467,And I believe the briefs now refer to it.
1974.74-165,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,541.155,543.447,"Well, it cannot be on here."
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,543.447,547.981,"Under the statute, it is not considered an appeal."
1974.74-165,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,547.981,549.674,That's another question.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,549.674,551.89,That could be another question Mr. Justice Douglas.
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,634.028,637.569,"Although, you the federal parties did appeal that, didn't they?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,637.569,658.057,"They did appeal in the Special Court has held that the Act was fair and equitable, so we are passed the stage at which a dismissal of a reorganization pursuant to 207 (b) is a possibility."
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,658.057,668.042,"Let say, what's -- why was the point of that provision of the statute making that providing for dismissal of the 77?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,668.042,684.805,That is not entirely clear to me that particular point of dismissing the reorganization in the event that this Act did not provide a fair and equitable process.
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,684.805,689.171,Its kind of -- kind of a non-secretor or something --
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,689.171,689.567,Perhaps the Court --
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,689.567,694.398,"What one wonders about is its purposes, is there any legislative history showing what the reasons wants to do it --"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,694.398,696.345,There is Justice -- I do not have it.
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.088,802.209,I take it then you think it -- absolutely essential with that issue be decided?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,802.209,804.889,"I do, Mr. Justice White."
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,804.889,813.38,Would that means that you in effect concede constitutional invalidity of the statute and the absence of that remedy?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,813.38,830.479,"In effect, we say Mr. Justice Stewart, that we do not think there will be an unconstitutional role and I think the Special Court is quite persuasive about the unlikelihood of a interim or role amounting to the Constitution I think."
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,850.246,856.83,In the absence of the Tucker Act remedy in the event of such unconstitutional taking then --
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,856.83,863.643,Yes and I would not put at Mr. Justice Stewart that the Act would then become unconstitutional at large.
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.965,895.367,"You mean, what?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,895.367,896.178,The timetable.
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,896.792,897.83,I didn't hear what you just said.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,897.83,899.988,"Well, I was referring to the enormous complexity --"
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,899.988,901.321,"Oh, I did not catch your word."
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,901.321,902.253,And heroic effort.
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.253,903.932,I beg your pardon.
1974.74-165,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,903.932,910.64,Is this change in position and traceable for the fact that this is a corporation as a federal instrumentally?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,910.64,910.802,No.
1974.74-165,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,910.802,911.601,In your judgment?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,911.601,919.65,"Mr. Justice Douglas, it is not -- it is simply that -- oh, you mean the fact that the change of position is not even that."
1974.74-165,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,933.127,948.306,"Well, do you agree that with the three-judge court that the question of whether the transfer of the properties as such was a taking that is not right?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,948.306,949.685,The question --
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.685,952.648,Or you are focusing wholly on the erosion --
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,952.648,952.874,"No, I am not."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.874,957.325,Or in terms of the necessity to decide the Tucker Act question?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,957.325,958.418,"No, I am not Mr. Justice White."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.949,977.121,And that is true even without -- even assuming no erosion?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,977.121,977.671,That is true.
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.671,983.355,"So, the three-judge court you are suggesting is wrong and that -- in the saying that wasn't right?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,983.355,985.929,I want to make a distinction between this.
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.596,1005.287,"And you say that same is true with erosion, with respect to erosion?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1005.287,1008.672,We cannot tell for a fact that there will be erosion.
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1035.661,1046.973,"In a sense, this is sort of an -- the absence of an issue that is justiceable at this time or right this issue isn't it?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1058.332,1059.066,That is correct.
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.103,1068.719,Yes.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1068.719,1074.193,"And that therefore, the Tucker Act issue is a criminal issue in this case."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.193,1074.667,Yes.
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.667,1095.356,"Mr. Bork, what if the govern -- what if Congress pass a law saying that, five years from now, we are going to build such and such reclamation project and describe the lands that we are going to be taking and said that instead of paying these people for the lands and money, we're going to pay them in Conrail stock."
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1104.339,1117.092,"Only if one assumes that the Conrail stock, if one gets reason to know that the Conrail stock would in fact be an adequate compensation from what they gave up."
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1118.92,1125.896,But wouldn't a typical answer this court be that there will be time enough to decide that when the Government actually takes your property?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1125.896,1128.055,Well I think not Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.686,1145.243,You may end up never thinking about it.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1145.243,1148.938,"That is correct, but here, it is quite likely that--"
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.938,1159.111,"But what's the -- what is the compulsion beside at them but when the property is taken under any, then it is just --"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1159.111,1162.356,"Oh, well in this case."
1974.74-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1195.182,1200.609,"Well, are you suggesting Mr. Solicitor General, that if the worst happens."
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1216.28,1236.502,"If Section 303 of this Act, Mr. Chief Justice, does not turnout to provide adequate compensation and if it should turnout that they have no Tucker Act remedy available, there would have been an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment."
1974.74-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1236.502,1240.904,And could there be a judicial remedy for that when that point was reached?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1240.904,1241.54,No.
1974.74-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1257.829,1265.85,"Do you think that would have something to do with the appeal ability provisions, the review ability of the Special Courts?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1265.85,1272.485,"Well, the Act specifically provides that that evaluation decision is appealable to this Court."
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1274.489,1279.052,"But again, we can't on appeal, we couldn't appropriate money."
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1279.052,1282.572,"That's quite true, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.74-165,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.572,1309.309,"My Brother Rehnquist question really should be a -- to be an analog, I should suppose a legislation passed by Congress that would definitely appropriate certain property and say that the payment for this property will be ex-shares of Conrail stock and that there will be no Tucker Act remedy, no other thing given for the property and that is the analog that you have --"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1309.309,1310.375,That's quite right.
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.375,1315.791,But if that were the -- supposing following up my Brother Stewart's question.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1336.334,1359.016,"Because Mr. Stewart is in fact raising the analogy of a statute which said, ""In the end of five years, we will flip a coin, if it is heads, you get paid off in full, if it is tails, you get nothing, if you get nothing, there is no Tucker Act remedy and you are just out of your property."""
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.016,1360.527,"Okay, and the question is whether --"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1360.527,1362.375,If you wait --
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.375,1374.413,Whether you must wait under that statute and go in the -- until your property is taken and go in to a three-judge District Court and then join our constitutional or whether you can do it five years in advance.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1374.413,1399.039,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it would seem to me its trifle it adds with a jurisprudence to tell a man that there is a 50/50 chance his property will be taken under the statute and that if it is, he will have no remedy and he may not try to enjoin the statute in advance, but must go forward and take his 50/50 chance."
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1399.039,1404.286,"Well, I can conceive of a statute which was totally it adds with our jurisprudence."
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1411.405,1432.295,"Well, the statute is in effect now and the mechanism leading toward this result is in full swing, and if these parties, I hate to be making there case, but if these parties has to wait until that date, they are without remedy, and I do not think that that --."
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.295,1435.307,If they had a three-judge District Court remedy now.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1437.763,1442.221,"Because the three-judge District Court remedy then, will do them no good."
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.221,1445.134,Why can't they enjoin the taking at that time?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1445.134,1452.879,"Oh, I mean why won't we wait on separate -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we will be in no better position at that time to know anything about this case."
1974.74-165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1452.879,1456.456,But at least the taking will be much more immanent?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1456.456,1478.325,"The taking will be immanent, but we will not know whether the compensation to be paid is adequate or not because this statute provides that the property will be taken before evaluation proceedings begin and it will be some years after, this is enormously complex evaluation proceedings or at least lengthy one."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.068,1489.459,"Well, that's, that's -- its going to be years, whether is that right but it's not?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1489.459,1494.523,"That's true, but at least, we will know with the Tucker Act that the compensation will be there."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.523,1498.1,"So, you'll be happy while you're waiting?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1498.1,1503.842,"They may not feel happy while they are waiting Mr. Justice White, but their constitutional rights will not have been infringed."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.023,1510.827,Would be and won't be infringed either if they get paid enough for that designed in Tucker Act.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1510.827,1513.734,"That is true, but can't be sure they will."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.734,1515.647,I'm sure they wont.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1523.914,1532.367,"Yes, but I think we are, but I think that's -I think the right in this issue will not change in this case until it is too late."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.367,1535.859,It will change for you.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1535.859,1539.37,I've always thought that Tucker Act was right.
1974.74-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1651.859,1666.345,I suppose you would agree that the issue of constitutionality can't be resolved here with any of you to even the probability that Congress would remedy any defects in the future.
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1666.345,1678.992,"No, Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, but I think these two injunctions or reading the statute in those ways would effectively protect the creditor interest against an unconstitutional taking."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.897,2459.078,Is that the same sort of an argument that we would use if you were asked why the three-judge court had any power at all in this case?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2459.078,2466.434,"Well, I'm not quite sure about either the same kind of argument I would use."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.489,2476.39,"Well, that the Special Court apparently thought it had and perhaps it does."
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2489.197,2498.548,"It made that question of Congress' intent there is unclear, but I think there are separate reasons for saying that the three-judge District Court did have jurisdiction."
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.369,2508.946,"The issue isn't raised by anyone, case is it?"
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2508.946,2509.921,Not that I know.
1974.74-165,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.921,2515.409,How do you classify that?
1974.74-165,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,2515.409,2534.035,"In order to find a repeal of the Tucker Act, we have to be asked to belief that the Congress knowingly insisted upon continued operations knew that they might cause losses and for that reason repeal the Tucker Act because it did not want to compensate."
1974.74-165,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2943.025,2945.867,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
1974.74-165,1,17406,brockman_adams,,3812.81,3817.436,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1974.74-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4031.254,4039.237,"And you would say that they shouldn't reach the Tucker Act matter or should say that we should reach it and say, it is unavailable?"
1974.74-165,1,17406,brockman_adams,,4039.237,4047.954,I think you should that if the Tucker Act requires a deficiency judgment as part of this process to make it constitutional.
1974.74-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4071.815,4077.252,"So, you do anticipate a situation, where the Tucker Act would be available?"
1974.74-165,1,17406,brockman_adams,,4077.252,4078.048,"Oh, yes."
1974.74-165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4103.439,4105.682,"So, the Tucker Act you would think would be available message?"
1974.74-165,1,17406,brockman_adams,,4105.682,4109.575,"And of course, we did not repeal the matter."
1974.74-165,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4111.685,4115.599,"Thank you, Mr. Adams."
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,4120.395,4123.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4167.835,4168.386,Who's make the --
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,4168.386,4169.148,Let me explain.
1974.74-165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4169.148,4171.906,"Who's make the move, Mr. Horsky?"
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,4171.906,4174.968,The Solicitor General.
1974.74-165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5320.859,5326.577,Is it conceivable that the Court could determine that there is no Tucker Act remedy and that nonetheless the statute --
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5326.577,5327.601,Is constitution.
1974.74-165,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5342.199,5352.726,"It is also conceivable of course, that the Court could hold the Act as not constitutional despite a Tucker Act remedy."
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5353.982,5354.838,That's right.
1974.74-165,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5355.522,5359.662,"Come down and a -- the payment in securities rather than cash and all sorts of it, like that."
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5359.662,5367.771,"I have one point like that myself that I would come to, but let me take on premise what I think the appropriate relief should be."
1974.74-165,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5495.917,5500.82,What if really make all that difference there would be an equity receivership I guess that --
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5500.82,5503.153,It would presumably be an equity receiver.
1974.74-165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5520.898,5526.055,The only thing that will be deprived of is a liquidation type reorganization plan?
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5526.055,5527.848,You'd be deprived of the entire --
1974.74-165,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5527.848,5528.999,You wouldnt be deprived of that.
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5528.999,5531.243,"Apparently of Section 77, whatever it gives you."
1974.74-165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5531.243,5532.794,In order to carry out liquidation?
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5532.794,5543.501,In order to carry out reorganization or liquidation -- a New Haven type reorganization or a sale in pieces or various other kinds.
1974.74-165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5543.501,5550.017,"Yes, but you do not reach this unless you find the railroad isn't reorganizable as a profitable railroad?"
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5550.017,5554.363,"Well, it is not reorganizable as a profitable."
1974.74-165,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5677.252,5700.084,"But Judge Friendly's basis for sustaining that by the Court of special appeals or the Special Court was that in effect Congress was including all presently bankrupt railroads in the system, and if -- and it seems to me that if you make that argument with respect to your point, Mr. Horsky, that Judge Friendly would rule against you?"
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5700.084,5708.884,"Well, I am not sure because it seems that you have here a situation where the problem is imminent as between debtors."
1974.74-165,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5740.989,5759.419,"Do you agree that if the constitutionality of these pro -- the provisions of the Act now at issue are upheld in this litigation and in view of what the Special Court has done, then this point wouldn't arise."
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5759.419,5760.738,This point would be moved.
1974.74-165,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5760.738,5761.704,"That's correct, isn't it?"
1974.74-165,2,19194,charles_a_horsky,,5761.704,5762.171,Yes.
1974.74-165,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5776.4,5781.83,"Thank you, Mr. Horsky."
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,5783.898,5789.639,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-165,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5989.807,6004.186,"Well, that I can see that might be a basis for attacking the abandonment's or the anti-abandonment provisions, but why would that afford a basis for attacking the ultimate compensation the fact that interim erosion occurs?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6004.186,6006.937,"By itself, it might not."
1974.74-165,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6688.304,6695.76,That was a found essential on the context of other not it was fair and equitable plan wasn't it?
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6695.76,6696.099,"That's right, sir."
1974.74-165,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6696.099,6697.532,And whether or not it was constitutional.
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6699.027,6699.366,No --
1974.74-165,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6699.366,6702.068,One higher and one lower or are they equivalent?
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6702.068,6704.827,I think to these purposes of they are the same.
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6852.468,6856.89,And that amounts to a repealer or does it not in your terms?
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6859.571,6862.564,Preemption sort of the --
1974.74-165,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6906.682,6910.024,That's true in the flooding case I think.
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6910.024,6923.507,"I don't think it was true in the same sense and it seems to us that in that case, there were radical distinctions which I oppose to address, both the flooding case, the Lynch case and Hurley --"
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6923.507,6936.064,But if this Court says it holds that the Tucker Act is not repealed and controls what is that do to your position in this respect?
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6936.064,6949.71,"Then, you have to reach the second question as to whether or not the punitive existence of a Tucker Act remedy here provides a remedy which is sufficiently certain and clear as to have required abstention from the injunction below."
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6949.71,6951.741,"You mean, when I pursue that after lunch."
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6951.741,6952.115,I will.
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6970.037,6971.999,"Mr. Craco, you may continue."
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6976.796,6980.472,I think I have about 10 minutes in modest encroaching rights on my brother.
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6980.472,6983.026,Very well.
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,6983.026,6986.066,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-165,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7118.264,7119.26,That was the insurance case?
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7119.26,7120.545,That's the insurance case.
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7320.223,7338.617,"On such an important question Mr. Craco, it would have been very simple for Congress to have made that clear in one sentence that Tucker Act is out of the picture, would it not?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7338.617,7346.338,I think it would have and obviously this issue would not be here if they had done so.
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7372.298,7385.274,You're suggesting indirectly that if there were some hypothetical way to take a poll of all the 435 members of the House and all the members of the Senate that majority of them never gave this subject in any thought one way or the other?
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7385.274,7387.864,I think that's very likely so in and for two reasons.
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7469.564,7475.82,"Well, assuming that they didn't intend to do anything with the Tucker Act, the Tucker Act is still there?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7475.82,7487.307,The Tucker Act is still there unless they precluded its application by another remedial statute which they did in fact enact and it's our position that they did that in this case.
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7487.307,7492.541,"Well, I thought you're argument was that the remedies provided here were different from the remedies to Tucker Act."
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7492.541,7493.761,"That's right, different and exhausted."
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7493.761,7497.319,"So, how could they be precluded the Tucker Act, if they are different?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7497.319,7499.753,"It's different, it's exclusive, and it's exhausted."
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7499.753,7503.294,But what do you have that says it's exclusive?
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7503.294,7518.771,"The inference from the language of Section 303 (c) that says that if the provisions of the Act do not provide the constitutional minimum to the estates, then, the Court shall enter a deficiency judgment against Conrail."
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7524.315,7527.327,"And if there's any other provision in Congress, it wouldn't apply."
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7527.327,7528.174,I'm sorry sir.
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7528.174,7533.077,"Any other provision of Congress as action wouldn't apply, is that your position?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7533.077,7533.799,I think it's?
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7548.354,7549.886,So you say that they?
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7549.886,7550.762,On Conrail.
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7550.762,7555.178,What they did but to say that the Tucker Act does not apply.
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7555.178,7556.462,"In effect, yes."
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7556.462,7562.352,"How can you say that without the Congress is just -- without mention it, they would appeal it?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7562.352,7563.51,Because as I said before --
1974.74-165,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7563.51,7564.633,All limited.
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7564.633,7568.266,I don't think that they were talking language of condemnation at all.
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7590.706,7592.935,"On that score, what would -- what's your view?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7598.599,7602.525,That's -- that gets me to adequacy right away.
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7659.936,7662.194,"That's what some people who are concern about it, is it not?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7662.194,7662.843,"Yes, it is."
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7662.843,7668.444,"Then why I'm curious, as to why you characterized others a sliver, sliver of value?"
1974.74-165,3,34275,louis_a_craco,,7668.444,7678.627,"Because at that point, the stock will be without value of Conrail can't respond to a judgment for no more than the asset value of its operating assets."
1974.74-165,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7774.061,7774.463,Very well.
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,7777.279,7780.073,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-165,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7901.69,7903.737,"What was the first date, the date of merger?"
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,7903.737,7908.753,"No, the date of the petition for reorganization, Your Honor, 6/21/1970."
1974.74-165,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7908.753,7909.897,"Oh, yes."
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,7909.897,7934.701,"And on the date when the Acts of the facts, it then already drop the $684 Million and using the Solicitor General's figures coming from his brief, he says that, the current liquidation value of the estate of apparently exceeds the valid claims against it by a minimum amount of $1.3 Billion what she contends is adequate to cushion this secured creditors."
1974.74-165,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,8002.196,8008.347,Is that in the position of your client in the reorganization court Mr. Berger that the operations are ought to be terminated?
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,8008.347,8015.725,"We have since petition in the Court terminates the rail operation, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-165,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,8632.408,8647.027,"Well, on you're theory Mr. Berger, then an individual against to whom there was an inversed condemnation ought to have a right to enjoin that rather than simply suing in the Court of Claims, because you can't be sure that Congress will appropriate the money?"
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,8647.027,8650.886,"I think that this becomes a matter of agreement, Justice Rehnquist."
1974.74-165,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8745.333,8747.942,Mr. Burger is there ever ?
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,8747.942,8749.152,"Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.74-165,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8749.152,8764.771,Is there ever any assurance that a judgment in the Court of Claims will be divided for by the Congress when let say an Indian tribe gets a $50 or $100 million judgment or someone else gets a $50 million judgment?
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,8764.771,8768.895,I wish all my clients were Indians but I seem that they are very well.
1974.74-165,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8800.997,8804.687,"Well, your answer to my question I think it is that there is no assurance?"
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,8804.687,8804.963,There is --
1974.74-165,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8804.963,8806.543,Congress will provide the money to pay any judgment in the Court of Claims.
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,8806.543,8809.837,"Except, except a realistic one, sir."
1974.74-165,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,8817.657,8826.957,Mr. Burger I was simply going to ask you if you would take off what you a guide realistically as the possible alternatives here.
1974.74-165,4,20567,david_berger,,8860.08,8865.124,"Realistically, may I please Your Honor, Mr. Justice Powell."
1974.74-165,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,8935.522,8936.215,Mr. Auerbach
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,8936.215,8941.625,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-165,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9516.775,9523.314,"I can promise you, I didn't write the opinion that they --"
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9523.314,9528.499,"Well, I regret to hear that Mr. Justice because I thought it was mass full opinion."
1974.74-165,5,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,9804.598,9808.251,"So, the Act, the lien doesn't follow up proceeds?"
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9808.251,9810.225,"No, Mr. Justice Douglas, it does not follow it."
1974.74-165,5,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,9810.225,9810.959,"I mean, the new Act?"
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9810.959,9812.688,"The new Act, no."
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9823.067,9830.29,But the various types for that pot will be still had some requisites on some priority basis?
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9830.29,9833.541,"Well, Mr. Justice White, the problems --"
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9833.541,9835.911,The reorganization proceeding isn't going to be dismissed?
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9835.911,9837.273,I wish I could ask that easily.
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9866.525,9873.077,But the Special Court when ask to decide to the value of very pieces that the various estates convey?
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9873.077,9874.032,Yes.
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9875.025,9889.453,"And to know that the -- so, that there's going to be some securities directed in the direction of the Penn Central Estate bound to which the you have a prior claimants?"
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9889.453,9891.357,"Well, I don't know if you have a prior claim."
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9892.81,9897.854,"Well, I know but you're going to be -- you all are just made in your own security a creditors."
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9897.854,9906.835,We all remained as secured creditors of Penn Central whose security has been conveyed out free of lien.
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9908.542,9913.741,"He retained your position in the estate, I suppose?"
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9913.741,9916.669,"Yes, but, we know now what our value is to Penn Central."
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9921.043,9922.532,We don't know now --
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9922.532,9923.224,I beg your pardon sir?
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9923.224,9924.22,We don't known now.
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9924.22,9925.131,"No, and we won't know."
1974.74-165,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9943.327,9956.501,"Let's assume is that absolutely certain, no question whatsoever that sooner or later there would be enough money or value in the Penn Central Estate to pay you off at least but nobody else."
1974.74-165,5,28861,joseph_auerbach,,9956.501,9958.505,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
