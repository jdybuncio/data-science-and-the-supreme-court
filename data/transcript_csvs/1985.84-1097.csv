1985.84-1097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.144,"Mr. Lewin, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,30.144,32.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,122.389,125.84,"Mr. Lewin, you mentioned enlisted personnel."
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,135.556,137.32,"No, he was an officer."
1985.84-1097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,152.486,153.36,--I thought you said enlisted personnel.
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,153.36,153.735,I'm sorry.
1985.84-1097,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.137,183.66,"Mr. Lewin, as long as you are interrupted, may I ask whether it makes any difference in your view if someone enters the service voluntarily, if the person entering the service knows and understands the military is not willing to grant such an exception for dress?"
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,183.66,203.451,"We think it really makes no difference, because we think that the decisions of this Court indicate that... Sherbert and Verner and Thomas and Review Board... that government may not condition benefits, for example, such as unemployment compensation benefits, on an unconstitutional condition such as deprivation of religious rights."
1985.84-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.137,250.183,"Well, Mr. Lewin, you refer to Sherbert against Verner and Thomas versus the Review Board."
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,257.038,257.398,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.466,408.618,But the military has also said... at least there is testimony... that any departure is in itself a defeat of the military objective which is uniformity of dress.
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,408.618,409.868,It's true.
1985.84-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.863,423.143,"That's what the military is saying, is that the purpose of uniforms is to make everybody look alike."
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,428.813,430.625,"--Agreed, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.058,485.774,"Where in the military context have we said, as you intimate we have said, that departures are not enough?"
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,485.774,489.726,"Well, I think by the emphasis on clear danger or--"
1985.84-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.726,494.723,"I think you are just drawing a negative inference from languages, where the holdings would be against you."
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,494.723,518.027,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the statements that have been made that say that the Constitution does protect individuals in the military service would itself be undermined if in fact the military could simply by saying so and expressing its expert opinion say that variations undermine morale."
1985.84-1097,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.38,538.923,It wouldn't mean... the military has never taken that sort of a position.
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,538.923,540.33,--We're fortunate that they haven't.
1985.84-1097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,617.737,630.013,"Well, Mr. Lewin, you pressed the point several times that the Constitution follows a person into the military, but not just the way it does for all civilians, of course."
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,679.572,684.258,"I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, every religious belief would have protection."
1985.84-1097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.254,695.299,You're approaching it from what I see as the other end.
1985.84-1097,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,713.73,719.54,"I think the burden to the military certainly is a very substantial factor, and where the--"
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1777.75,1781.483,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1097,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1790.027,1792.588,May I interrupt you?
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1792.588,1793.479,Yes.
1985.84-1097,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1793.479,1797.853,Are you still adhering to footnote 4?
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1797.853,1801.445,As to whether the yarmulke is required?
1985.84-1097,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1818.313,1820.03,Was that the finding of the district court?
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1820.03,1829.762,"I don't think that they made a finding, but to the extent that he did, he certainly did not say it was a requirement of Jewish law, and there is a definite distinction between Jewish law and--"
1985.84-1097,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1829.762,1833.275,"Well, what... on what premise should we decide this case?"
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1833.275,1853.891,"--I think if you decide it on Captain Goldman's own testimony, which we... at page 6 of our brief where the cite is to page 200 of the joint appendix, petitioner testified that a custom followed by some but not all devout Orthodox Jewish males is the wearing of a yarmulke."
1985.84-1097,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1860.436,1861.451,"Well, I gather you are saying, if--"
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1861.451,1862.497,I'm not--
1985.84-1097,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1862.497,1868.652,--If we have to proceed on that premise we don't have to reach the constitutional issue?
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1868.652,1893.437,"--It is clearly that premise, diminishes the level of the significance of the religious practice at issue here, but it is not the government's position that there is no religious issue at all involved, that it has to rise to the level of Jewish law before Captain Goldman can claim it as a sincere religious practice that he personally follows."
1985.84-1097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1893.437,1895.936,For what other reason does he wear a yarmulke?
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1895.936,1896.311,Pardon?
1985.84-1097,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1896.311,1901.184,"What other reason does the Captain wear, other than religious?"
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1901.184,1916.226,"His interpretation of what he should do as a devout Orthodox Jew is wear a yarmulke, and we are willing to accept that as a sincere religious belief on his part, just as in the prior case we're willing to accept the sincerity of the religious--"
1985.84-1097,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1916.226,1918.818,"Which is only to say then, we shall address--"
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1918.818,1941.324,"--Yes, but I think it's not at all irrelevant for the Court to take cognizance of the fact that Captain Goldman himself acknowledges that it's not required by the laws of his religion and the government introduced the authorities cited in the footnote 4 to show that Jewish rabbinical authorities agree with that."
1985.84-1097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1941.324,1950.711,"--Yet, it's not just a matter of private choice, it's a private choice of alternatives that includes a long tradition?"
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1950.711,1959.864,"It is, and that's why we are not asking the Court to say this is not a religious practice entitled to consideration."
1985.84-1097,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.864,1964.939,It certainly is a firmly held belief of the Captain's?
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1964.939,1970.391,"That's correct, and as the Court has indicated, in some cases religions of one are sufficient."
1985.84-1097,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.391,1971.077,"Yes, indeed."
1985.84-1097,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1983.917,1995.192,"As you point out in the last case, Your Honor, religions have a way of gaining sudden popularity and spreading like wildfire, but I'm not suggesting that yarmulkes--"
1985.84-1097,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3174.106,3186.337,"If I might just take a minute, Your Honor, on Ms. Oberly's last point, the fact is, of course, that Congress will be affected by whatever this Court says regarding this case."
1985.84-1097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.758,3191.897,They would be if we decided it on a constitutional ground.
1985.84-1097,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3191.897,3209.766,"--Yes, and if this Court says there's no constitutional right, at the time this was being discussed in the halls of Congress, military personnel went down to see Senator Hatch and we have reproduced some of that material in that reply brief, the question was, is there a constitutional right."
1985.84-1097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3291.968,3312.131,"Mr. Lewin, you have suggested that when this Court acts, that we approve... not frequently, but certainly it's not infrequently, that we pass on an Act of Congress, that doesn't mean we approve what they've done."
1985.84-1097,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3329.562,3336.028,"--Well, I'm afraid, from my experience with Congress, they certainly focus very much on what this Court says."
1985.84-1097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3336.028,3336.809,"Thank you, counsel."
