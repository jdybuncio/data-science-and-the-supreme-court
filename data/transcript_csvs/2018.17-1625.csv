2018.17-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.6,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-1625, Rimini Street, Incorporated versus Oracle USA. Mr. Perry."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,8.6,16.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The term ""costs"" is a term of art in federal law."
2018.17-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,46.24,49.92,"Well, what about full costs? I mean, that's the issue, right?"
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,49.92,56.4,"Your Honor, it is. Congress can, of course, override the default definition, and when it does so, it must do it explicitly."
2018.17-1625,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,131.32,134.36,"Mr. Perry, I -- I understand all that case law."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,164.6,165.76,If I could address --
2018.17-1625,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,165.76,187.16,"Number two, I think your adversary pointed us to three statutes of many that have the word ""full costs."" Give me a meaning to those three statutes that would give effect to the word ""full."""
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,187.16,189.08,"Justice Sotomayor, if I can take those in reverse order."
2018.17-1625,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,192.8,196.92,But it's discretionary under both the Copyright Act now and under the statute.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,196.92,204.2,"Yes, Your Honor, but in Crawford Fitting, the Court said the discretion is the on/off switch -- the question -- under 54(d), whether or not to give costs."
2018.17-1625,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,205.84,207.36,"The government hasn't excepted that yet, though."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,207.36,224.04,"Well, Section 2412, which this Court identified in the Baker Botts case as the clearest example of a cost statute that overrides the presumption, says that costs in a government case can be awarded in whole or in part -- Congress understands that concept -- whereas, in a copyright case, they're awarded full costs."
2018.17-1625,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.76,275.36,Could you point me to where in your brief or an amici accounted for those 800 cases?
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,275.36,277.12,"Your Honor, we don't have them all listed out."
2018.17-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,290.12,299.4,"The -- your -- your argument, though, would assume there are a lot of cases where, although costs were awarded, they weren't all costs."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,300.56,302.52,"We don't have any of those either, Your Honor."
2018.17-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,303.6,311.8,"Well, then why would Congress be worried about saying ""full costs""? Nobody's ever apparently ever awarded fewer than few costs or less than few costs."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,311.8,315.84,"Your Honor, we think it came out of the English copyright statute, which says full costs."
2018.17-1625,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,351.8,356.28,"If you're right, why have the provision at all? Wouldn't 1920 do the trick?"
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,356.28,362.6,"Well, Your Honor, there's 208 federal cost statutes; 207 of them don't reference 1920 either."
2018.17-1625,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,412.4,415.24,"Well, that's a good reason for having 1920."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,417.52,419.96,"Well, it doesn't repeat itself either, Your Honor."
2018.17-1625,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,473.24,482.0,"Well, it says -- the second sentence says that the -- the court may award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,488.88,490.44,"It -- it confirms it, Justice Alito."
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,598.0,620.36,"Is there a -- I read in the briefs, and I don't fully -- I want to be certain I grasped the argument, that there was a period of time many, many, many years ago when a court in awarding costs, a federal court, would look to state statutes, and the state statutes provided different amounts and didn't just repeat what we have today."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,620.36,621.36,Correct.
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,621.36,643.2,"And then I thought that you had argued that, well, the word ""full costs"" means don't just look -- there are other things they don't look to the state statutes, but if state statute A awarded 33 cents and state statute B awarded $4,000, it would mean that you go and look to the actual cost."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,643.2,645.52,"Our argument is a little different than that, Justice Breyer."
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.52,647.2,What is that? That's what I'm trying to find out.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,647.2,652.2,"In 1831, when state law would have applied, many states had gradated fee schedules."
2018.17-1625,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,702.76,715.16,"When I read this argument, the first prong by you, I thought could it mean full costs, 1920, without the limits of 1821?"
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,715.16,723.96,"Your Honor, it -- it unlikely means that since 1920 and 1821 were separated by the codifiers."
2018.17-1625,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,749.24,754.36,"No, I -- I understand that, but I still don't -- I'm still trying to give meaning to ""full."""
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,754.36,755.4,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2018.17-1625,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,755.4,761.48,And -- and so 1821 sets certain limits.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,773.36,777.64,"I think that would give meaning to the word ""full."" I think 1821 would remain binding."
2018.17-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,794.6,797.6,But you -- you haven't found a single case where that was an issue?
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,797.6,802.92,"Your Honor, it -- it hasn't been litigated, in part because I think cost bills generally are approved as a matter of course."
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.72,843.56,"Could you help me with just a fact, which may or may not be relevant, but in the SG's brief, the costs that you were searching was about $5 million. That's your view of what they're entitled to."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,843.56,844.52,"Three and a half million, but yeah."
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,844.52,846.64,Three and a half million now? All right.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,855.64,857.24,"No, Your Honor. Attorneys' fees were dealt with."
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,860.76,861.36,All right.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,865.8,866.56,Taxable costs.
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,866.56,870.88,"Yeah, and then they want an additional 17.6 million more?"
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,870.88,874.12,And they were awarded 12.8 million because of some deductions.
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.12,874.56,All right.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,885.96,887.76,"Thirty-five million dollars, Your Honor."
2018.17-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,887.76,894.8,So the entire 35 million goes to -- to cost? It cost 35 million to get 35 million?
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,894.8,902.16,"The costs and -- and expenses asserted by Oracle in this case were greater than the damages awarded by the jury, that is correct."
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,902.16,902.4,All right.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,917.36,921.68,"Your Honor, I will say the only thing odd about it is that this award was made."
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.96,932.92,"Well, maybe."
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,934.32,934.92,"Your Honor, they were --"
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,934.92,936.04,They might have gotten more.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,936.04,950.76,"They were seeking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions, and they lost almost everything, is the answer, and then they tried to externalize, to use Justice Gorsuch's word, the -- the -- the -- all the expenses they spent on unsuccessful claims, they tried to shift that back to the party that actually won."
2018.17-1625,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.84,962.16,Okay.
2018.17-1625,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,962.16,963.56,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2018.17-1625,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,963.56,968.56,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem."
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,968.56,977.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has treated ""costs"" as a term of art defined by the list in Section 1920."
2018.17-1625,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1128.96,1139.72,"Well, in 1831, according to your argument, federal law didn't really care -- didn't -- didn't have its own definition of what a cost would be."
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1143.36,1145.04,It wasn't a definitional provision.
2018.17-1625,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1145.04,1153.2,"Whatever it -- was in the -- and so, if I looked at every single one of the state fee schedules in 1831, what would I find?"
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1153.2,1153.92,So you would see --
2018.17-1625,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1153.92,1165.6,"Would I find that they all agree on what the concept of a cost is, or would I find that some of them include maybe the sort of things that were compensated here?"
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1165.6,1173.96,"So I think you'd find two things that are significant. First of all, you would not see any discovery fees and you would certainly not see any expert witness fees."
2018.17-1625,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1466.28,1471.48,"Well, Mr. Clement may have a surplusage problem, but you have a surplusage problem too, don't you?"
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1471.48,1473.52,So we think that --
2018.17-1625,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1473.52,1475.08,"""Full"" -- it means nothing."
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1475.08,1475.28,Yeah.
2018.17-1625,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1526.2,1528.52,How would -- how would that have worked? That wouldn't have worked.
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1528.52,1545.32,"Well, I think you could have argued in a case like this one that even for the costs that are authorized in Section 1920, you can't get the full amount of it or you can't presumptively get the full amount of it because Congress took the word ""full"" out, so, clearly, it wanted to cut back on the costs that were awardable."
2018.17-1625,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1549.12,1553.92,"You didn't adopt your adversary's on-and-off switch for the meaning of ""full."""
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1553.92,1558.16,"That -- that's correct. That's the one place, I think, that we're different."
2018.17-1625,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1558.16,1558.92,So explain --
2018.17-1625,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1558.92,1559.24,So -- yeah.
2018.17-1625,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.72,1586.2,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1586.2,1631.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The authorization in Section 505 of the Copyright Act for the recovery of full costs means what it says and authorizes the recovery of full costs, not just a narrow subset of costs set forth in Section 1920 as limited by Section 1821. The contrary reading not only renders the word ""full"" completely superfluous, but it also effectively renders the first sentence of Section 505 without any meaning and renders three other federal statutes that authorize the discretionary award of full costs meaningless the day they were enacted. There is no reason to adopt a construction that has those kind of consequences in rendering other statutory provisions superfluous."
2018.17-1625,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1774.0,1774.56,Mr. Clement --
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1774.56,1774.8,Sure.
2018.17-1625,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1774.8,1778.68,"-- you agree that if the word ""full"" wasn't in the statute you would lose?"
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1778.68,1779.88,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2018.17-1625,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1779.88,1780.8,Okay.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1800.8,1855.84,"So I think that case helps us because it shows that you look at both the adjective and the noun, and I think what the Court didn't have to say there but is absolutely true is sometimes the adjective tells you how the noun is being used. Just to illustrate that the adjective can make a big difference, if you think about the Weyerhaeuser case, and the adjective wasn't critical but was potential, potential habitat, I mean, habitat would still have a meaning, but I think the case would be very different. But I think what's more telling here is I think what the dispute here is we say that Congress in 1831, in 1909, in 1976 used the phrase ""full costs"" capaciously and used the word ""costs"" in its ordinary meaning. My friends on the other side say, no, ""cost"" was being used in a term of art sense. I think you look to the adjective in this case to tell you which of us is right. And I think there are --"
2018.17-1625,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1855.84,1885.96,"But that's a strange kind of thing, because you -- we started, you said, if it just said cost, we would all understand that it was the term of art in 1920 costs. And then you say that by adding the word ""full,"" rather than to say, look, it really is the full amount of the 1920 costs, don't try slicing and dicing the 1920 costs, rather, you want to use the word ""full"" to suggest that it's not the 1920 costs we're talking about at all."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1888.16,1893.0,"And I don't think that's strange at all, because it's not like some radically different kind of cost."
2018.17-1625,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2137.88,2142.28,They say that your argument makes the second sentence of 505 superfluous.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2143.04,2145.04,So I have two basic responses.
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.4,2255.24,"What do you say to, is there -- is there anything that will help me, and I might be unique in this, but I -- I often think that Congress when it uses these words doesn't really think about it. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2255.24,2270.48,"They -- they go up to the drafting section, there is a drafting section, and you'll get a young man or woman there who has to write a very complicated statute, and -- and they might use words they don't really think about. And so I look to a lot of other things, as in Murphy."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2291.88,2295.96,"So, Justice Breyer, I didn't see anything there that I found particularly helpful."
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.64,2300.48,"But I'm more -- I -- I mean, all right."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2302.52,2305.84,"Yeah, and it's really quite terrific, I think, for those that look at that sort of thing."
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.84,2305.84,Okay.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2307.48,2309.16,"No, no, because -- and -- and -- and so let me say two things about that."
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2309.16,2309.64,Yeah.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2309.64,2319.84,"I -- I'll just explain to you, Justice Breyer, why I -- I confirm that there was nothing particularly helpful. So the 1976 act is a soup-to-nuts reform of the Copyright Act."
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.84,2319.96,Yeah.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2319.96,2326.84,And there's not a lot of focus on what became Section 505 as to either attorneys' fees or costs.
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.96,2335.12,Uh-huh.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2335.12,2337.92,"-- to discretionary fees, but mostly they're talking about the attorneys' fees."
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.92,2407.0,Yeah.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2407.0,2411.4,"-- I'm going to use a much narrower term, ""investigatory costs."""
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2411.4,2411.84,All right.
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.96,2465.64,"All right? Now suppose -- and, after all, Murphy involved getting expert fees for the parents of handicapped children when, in fact, they, through the hiring of necessary experts, win. But the majority said in that case: No, they don't get their attorneys' fees. So am I stuck with that? You say no? Well, well, well, this is a general problem, go back to your lengthy career."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2490.72,2493.48,"Well, Justice Breyer, far be it from me to give you career advice -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2493.48,2494.08,-- but I would think --
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.08,2495.8,"No, no, that's what I'm asking for."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2495.8,2503.16,"I would think that the one thing you never -- you never abandon, just because you're in the dissent, is your basic approach to statutory construction."
2018.17-1625,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.32,2516.16,Pity. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2516.16,2582.92,"And that would be -- that would be my -- that would be my career advice on that, but I would -- I would say I don't think you're bound for at least two very important reasons. I mean, one is that -- and -- and Justice Ginsburg separately wrote a concurrence in the judgment to express her disagreement with this point, but the Court in Murphy, in agreement with the brief of the Solicitor General, applied a clear statement rule because it was a spending power case. And this is not a spending power case. So, if you were inclined to find a distinction from Murphy, I think most of your textualist colleagues would say: Legislative history is never going to overcome a clear statement test, ever. But, you know, some of them, not all of them, but some of them will take a peek at the legislative history when you're not dealing with a clear statement rule; you're just trying to get the best meaning of the statute, particularly when the legislative history supports a ruling or a reading of the statute that avoids rendering an important part of it superfluous. So I think you could distinguish Murphy on that ground, but I also want to say that we don't take issue with Murphy when it's dealing with the word ""costs"" unmodified, and that is a very familiar formulation."

2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2605.4,2608.52,And we think it powerfully suggests that it's using it in an ordinary meaning way.
2018.17-1625,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2608.52,2627.96,"I look at history completely, which means I look at how court of appeals and district courts have been using those terms now for decades. So the question is, where does that go into your analysis? Because it's contrary -- up until the Ninth Circuit, it's basically contrary to your point."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2627.96,2630.08,"Well, I -- I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-1625,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2655.0,2660.16,It's not because you told me you don't know what the New York statute permitted or didn't.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2663.4,2667.24,"No, I don't think it's a wash, and I think it's not a wash for two reasons."
2018.17-1625,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2691.44,2693.84,What did the -- what did the circuit rule say?
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2693.84,2700.44,The circuit rule said -- I think it was a provision that was relevant to this 11 versus 1 issue.
2018.17-1625,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2719.24,2726.12,"Well, we know in American history that attorneys' fees were considered recoverable for a long time."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2737.12,2737.96,"Well, but -- but there --"
2018.17-1625,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2737.96,2742.24,Was it 1976 -- what were the courts doing in 1976?
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2742.24,2750.84,"Well, 1976 -- you know, it's -- it's really a couple years after the '70 -- I don't think we have any good history in 1974 and 1975."
2018.17-1625,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2757.36,2758.08,Then let me -- let me --
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2758.08,2758.96,But they don't have the other case.
2018.17-1625,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2758.96,2761.0,-- get to my problem with your interpretation.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2814.88,2819.48,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, that's not a problem that's unique to my construction."
2018.17-1625,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.32,2876.04,"Well, what if the -- what if the objection is that the attorneys' fees were outrageous considering how much was at stake in the case? Can the judge, when he's dealing with a provision about full costs, say, well, but that's just -- these fees are outrageous; I'm only going to give you half of your attorneys' fees?"
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2876.04,2879.08,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and that's where discretion comes in."
2018.17-1625,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2931.8,2933.16,"Well, I guess I'm not following."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2936.44,2974.56,"No, I think that the -- that what I would say is I think the district court judge starts with the universe of full costs, and then can use their discretion to sort of carve that back if they think that that's appropriate. I also think that even in the ordinary meaning of costs, I think it would be perfectly appropriate for a court to say: Look, if you can't even document this thing, I'm not going to treat that as a cost for purposes of this. Whether they do it under a definition of costs under its ordinary meaning or as an exercise of discretion, I don't think it makes a great deal of difference. Now there's another provision out there I alluded to that involves all expenses and it says all expenses of the proceedings can be recovered."
2018.17-1625,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3116.16,3120.0,"Well, haven't we said we expect redundancy in these kind of statutes?"
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3120.0,3122.44,I -- I don't think that you have said that.
2018.17-1625,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3205.64,3209.68,You still have -- -- you still have the superfluity in the second sentence.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3223.64,3246.04,"No, it's not, Your Honor, because I don't see how you don't have that second sentence if you want -- if what you want to do is indicate that the authorization for discretionary attorneys' fees in the second sentence doesn't trump Section 412's provision that says if you don't timely register, then you don't get your attorneys' fees. And, of course, 412 treats costs differently, so they needed two sentences."
2018.17-1625,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3267.88,3271.84,"There's a lot of redundancy, as you well know, in the U.S. Code, though."
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3281.72,3284.04,"Yeah, but, Justice Kavanaugh, there's a difference."
2018.17-1625,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3284.52,3285.56,So I don't know that it's carnage.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3286.16,3287.2,"But, no, but here's where there is --"
2018.17-1625,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3287.2,3287.32,Yeah.
2018.17-1625,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3287.32,3289.44,This is the difference. And this is what makes it carnage.
