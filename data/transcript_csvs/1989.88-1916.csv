1989.88-1916,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1916, Minnesota v. Robert Darren Olson."
1989.88-1916,0,16765,anne_e_peek,,9.606,26.65,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1916,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,61.289,66.442,"Now, what's at issue here is a statement that was given at the police station?"
1989.88-1916,0,16765,anne_e_peek,,66.442,67.658,That's correct.
1989.88-1916,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,67.658,73.881,"At the time that he was at the police station, was there not probable cause to hold the prisoner?"
1989.88-1916,0,16765,anne_e_peek,,73.881,75.364,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1916,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,75.364,83.654,"Well then, how is it that this statement is really related to what occurred in the dwelling in any event?"
1989.88-1916,0,16765,anne_e_peek,,83.654,93.01,"Well, the respondent is claiming that his arrest was illegal under the Fourth Amendment and that his statement was a fruit of the illegal arrest."
1989.88-1916,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.01,100.164,"Well, there would have been a right, I take it, to let him go for 30 seconds and re-arrest him after he got outside of the dwelling."
1989.88-1916,0,16765,anne_e_peek,,100.164,102.782,"I suppose that's true, Your Honor."
1989.88-1916,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,104.818,112.305,"There's no right to be free from custody once they are in the station house just because there has been an unlawful entry in the dwelling, is there?"
1989.88-1916,0,16765,anne_e_peek,,112.305,114.589,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1989.88-1916,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,114.589,126.731,"There is no right to an immediate release at the station house, a release from custody, merely because there has been an unlawful entry into the dwelling, even assuming the entry to the dwelling was unlawful?"
1989.88-1916,0,16765,anne_e_peek,,126.731,129.116,"I suppose that's true, Your Honor."
1989.88-1916,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.116,134.218,"Well, then, why is it that we really have to reach this issue?"
1989.88-1916,0,16765,anne_e_peek,,136.703,146.895,"Well, the state, of course, has always felt that this is an admissible statement because the arrest was legal, and we've never really argued--"
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1141.623,1150.495,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.88-1916,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1172.445,1174.461,What's a cornered... what's a cornered felon?
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1174.461,1181.733,"--For purposes of this case we have a very narrow definition, which is one who was actually tipped off, who knew that the police were on to him."
1989.88-1916,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.989,1200.512,"Suppose the police come out with their sirens and their lights blaring, is he then cornered, because the police have let him know that they're there?"
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1200.512,1208.884,"--The next step in the inquiry, of course, as respondent argues, is that there was in fact no exigency here because it was manufactured by police."
1989.88-1916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.238,1272.738,"Mr. Marzen, let me just be sure I understand one thing."
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1280.094,1280.477,No.
1989.88-1916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.581,1290.533,"So it is your position there was probable cause at the time of the entry, but arguably not before the phone call?"
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1290.533,1296.187,"--Arguably not before the phone call, so that is why he needed to call up."
1989.88-1916,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1440.164,1447.401,"Mr. Marzen, do most jurisdictions today have provisions for getting search warrants by telephone?"
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1447.401,1451.822,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, they do, and Minnesota in fact has that availability."
1989.88-1916,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1451.822,1457.876,So why... why are you saying it inevitably would take hours to get the warrant?
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1457.876,1467.981,"Well, Detective DeConcini actually testified, I believe it was on either 116 or 118 of the record, that even during the normal business hours of 8:00 to 4:00 it takes an hour or two to get a warrant."
1989.88-1916,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1469.516,1471.549,Using the telephonic procedure?
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1471.549,1473.051,--He spoke generally.
1989.88-1916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1597.382,1602.02,I... I am not sure that they are flip sides of the same coin.
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1614.078,1614.311,Uh-huh.
1989.88-1916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1614.311,1616.211,I have a right to admit my guests.
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1622.148,1631.337,"Well, in the absence of the other co-tenant or occupant you have a... you clearly have the right to admit and exclude."
1989.88-1916,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.715,1651.667,"So the right to admit does not... I mean, that's the point."
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1655.053,1671.664,"--Well, if you... for just purposes of a thought experiment, eliminated the other persons there, they have a right to admit or exclude on their... I guess I don't fully understand the question in that you do have a right to admit and exclude."
1989.88-1916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.059,1697.748,It seems to me your flip side argument suggests that we should analyze this as though he's the only person with an interest to be examined.
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1697.748,1698.415,"Yes, and--"
1989.88-1916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1698.415,1698.498,And if that's true--
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1698.498,1699.215,--my answer to your question--
1989.88-1916,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.215,1701.45,--What's your answer to the question?
1989.88-1916,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,1701.45,1712.306,"--My answer to the question you gave my co-counsel is that Olson would not... if a stranger knocked at the door, Olson would not have had any right to admit that person and therefore would have had no right to exclude him or her either."
1989.88-1916,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.085,1760.054,"Thank you, Mr. Marzen."
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1761.571,1766.725,Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist and may it please the Court:
1989.88-1916,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.29,1817.675,"You refer to him as an overnight guest, Mr. Bruder."
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1821.71,1822.996,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1916,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.316,1834.454,"Well, was the living room a place where he, and he alone, had dominion, so to speak?"
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1834.454,1837.037,I believe the living room was a common area.
1989.88-1916,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.659,1857.985,"This is not quite like the case, then, where one goes to someone's house to visit and they say, here's your room and here are your towels and so forth, and you're given at least a room over which you have some dominion?"
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1857.985,1860.702,"Well, in some ways, Your Honor, I think it's exactly like that."
1989.88-1916,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1911.051,1917.371,"Can you really generalize that much about an overnight house guest, that you have the run of the house?"
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1924.609,1930.929,"I hate to disagree with the Chief Justice of the United States, but no, Your Honor, I have not had that experience."
1989.88-1916,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.529,1939.118,And you say you think that a common experience is much more like yours than like mine?
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1939.784,1976.076,"I would suggest, trying to get out of this as diplomatically as I can, Your Honor, I would suggest that common experience has to take in all gambits of society, large houses as well as small houses, and that there are certainly situations, and quite common circumstances in this country, where an overnight house guest may not have an area segregated to them, but nonetheless has, in essence, rights that are akin to members of the household and in those circumstances it's our position that that house guest has a reasonable expectation--"
1989.88-1916,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1976.076,1980.461,Is this man truly an overnight house guest?
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1984.063,1985.496,"--He did indeed, Your Honor."
1989.88-1916,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1986.946,1990.717,Does the average overnight guest have an extra suit of clothing?
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1990.717,1995.252,I think it depends on the circumstances by which they arrive at the house.
1989.88-1916,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1995.252,1996.704,How many overnights did he stay?
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,1996.704,1998.654,He stayed there one night.
1989.88-1916,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.673,2003.391,"Well, he was a day-and-a-half nighter."
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2003.391,2010.63,"He was a day and a half, Your Honor, and he did also testify at the pretrial suppression hearing that he had no other place to reside and he intended to stay there."
1989.88-1916,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2010.63,2014.165,xxx stayed there one night.
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2014.165,2020.819,"I don't give up to... well, Your Honor, the fact is, unfortunately he was arrested before he could stay there more than one night--"
1989.88-1916,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.377,2036.162,Did his host indicate that he could have stayed longer?
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2036.162,2036.779,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1916,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.303,2050.338,"Well, you don't need to go that far."
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2050.338,2061.313,"No, but my position is that one night gives him enough standing, so to speak, to come before this Court and avail himself of his Fourth Amendment privilege."
1989.88-1916,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.508,2111.996,"It's not any Fourth Amendment claim, it's the particular Fourth Amendment claim that your home has been invaded."
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2111.996,2132.659,"--I believe that the... what the Solicitor General is in essence arguing is that unless it's your home or your tenancy, you don't have a right to object to your arrest in that particular dwelling, and that particular model does not work very well based on the common sense living arrangements that we have in society."
1989.88-1916,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.378,2218.682,Why... why should it make any difference whether you're transient or not?
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2218.682,2220.8,"Your Honor, I--"
1989.88-1916,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.8,2227.969,"Well, let's... let's assume you're... you're in the same... you know, the friend's house that you say you occasionally stay at."
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2235.207,2250.569,"--I would welcome the Court holding that, but realistically I think that the difference is that when you're there for dinner, again, it deals with the freedom that you're given over the premises."
1989.88-1916,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.648,2277.052,"What if you've been given the run of the place, if the person said mi casa es su casa, and really meant it?"
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2277.052,2278.318,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1916,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.318,2278.768,Then you'd be all right.
1989.88-1916,2,24971,glenn_p_bruder,,2279.752,2281.854,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1916,3,16765,anne_e_peek,,3135.175,3146.047,"Your Honor, it's not the state's position that Mr. Bruder's privacy expectations will be eliminated by... when he stays with a friend."
1989.88-1916,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3234.838,3237.388,"Thank you, Ms. Peek."
