1971.70-90,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.637,"We will hear arguments next in number 90, Schilb against Kuebel."
1971.70-90,1,32734,james_a_rooney,,1177.035,1180.836,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1971.70-90,2,32273,john_j_o’toole,,1655.379,1658.184,"Yes, there is something in the history."
1971.70-90,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.793,1676.797,I see.
1971.70-90,2,32273,john_j_o’toole,,1676.797,1681.69,"Out of all the bonds that are forfeited, almost all of them were written by bail bondsman at that time."
1971.70-90,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1687.596,1700.418,At any given time do you know what is the balance or the average balance in all of the accounts maintained to this 10%?
1971.70-90,2,32273,john_j_o’toole,,1700.418,1709.449,"The average balance, I can tell you how much the state ends up making each year in Cook County."
1971.70-90,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.769,1713.914,And the interest?
1971.70-90,2,32273,john_j_o’toole,,1713.914,1715.17,In 1%.
1971.70-90,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.17,1721.165,"Oh no, I mean in interest, this money whether it is a 100% or 10% is put in the bank I assume, is it not?"
1971.70-90,2,32273,john_j_o’toole,,1721.165,1722.123,I assume so.
1971.70-90,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1722.123,1726.567,I assume also if we put it in the bank it pays interest.
1971.70-90,2,32273,john_j_o’toole,,1726.567,1731.513,Our public officials would be -- were missing their duty if they did not put it in that type of an account.
1971.70-90,3,32734,james_a_rooney,,2278.919,2280.372,Only one.
1971.70-90,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.372,2289.065,"And all three of them need court officials to do the paperwork, all three of them."
1971.70-90,3,32734,james_a_rooney,,2289.065,2290.177,Correct.
1971.70-90,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2290.177,2295.207,And the only basis of this 1% on this would be because of this special new thing?
1971.70-90,3,32734,james_a_rooney,,2295.207,2297.294,"No, because we are giving them a special benefit."
1971.70-90,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2301.128,2304.839,"But you could release him for nothing, on recognizance."
1971.70-90,3,32734,james_a_rooney,,2304.839,2306.067,"Yes, we could."
1971.70-90,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.883,2310.826,That is what I think is the petitioner’s argument.
1971.70-90,3,32734,james_a_rooney,,2310.826,2316.413,"Well, I did not perhaps understand it that way."
1971.70-90,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.413,2325.847,I think the difference is that you take position that once you reach to the point where he is not eligible (Inaudible).
1971.70-90,3,32734,james_a_rooney,,2334.529,2344.458,"Correct and as I try to explain, I believe that is because judges made a determination before we get to that point that he is substantially different."
1971.70-90,4,32273,john_j_o’toole,,2766.676,2768.77,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1971.70-90,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.008,2842.8,"I am confused, they would have paid 10% to the bond, like these people right here and there would not be any like that?"
1971.70-90,4,32273,john_j_o’toole,,2842.8,2843.941,That is right Your Honor.
1971.70-90,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2843.941,2860.307,"So, Illinois says, if you pay us the 10%, we will let you out on the same condition and when the case is over we will give you 9% back (voice overlap) I mean, how do you lose on that?"
1971.70-90,4,32273,john_j_o’toole,,2860.307,2861.79,"Well, basically."
1971.70-90,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.79,2864.131,How does this man lose?
1971.70-90,4,32273,john_j_o’toole,,2864.131,2879.619,"That man did not lose at all, I agree with you that they had improved the system, there is no doubt about it, but the difference between the clerk and the bondsman is, the clerk is not having an undertaking to pay the full amount if the guy jumps bail."
