1966.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,30.277,"Number 118, James A. Dombrowski et al., Petitioners, versus James Eastland et al."
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,34.121,37.81,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,187.579,194.474,What does the complaint say alleged that the two defendants did?
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,194.474,200.253,The complaint alleges that they participated fully in this conspiracy.
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,200.253,201.692,Where is that?
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,201.692,205.891,"That's in the first allegation, the general allegation Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,205.891,220.688,All I saw in your complaint was sort of a conclusory allegation as distinguished from the allegation about other people with respect to these defendants.
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,229.517,230.409,"Now, in addition --"
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,230.409,240.432,"That is that they entered into a planned agreement in conspiracy to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights, privileges and immunities."
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,240.432,241.906,"You're right, Justice Fortas."
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,261.845,272.155,"I understand that but what I'm saying is that as to the beginning of the conspiracy, the alleged conspiracy, the illegal seizure of documents --"
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,272.155,272.653,Those facts --
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,272.653,275.951,-- the only allegation that you don't make any specific allegation with respect to that.
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,275.951,277.471,That's right Justice Fortas.
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,306.741,309.686,"Well, what was -- what was that as you understand it?"
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,312.357,324.48,"Certainly, the facts which emerged from the affidavits and from their own respondent, Sourwine's testimony were these following facts."
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,399.713,403.052,"Yes, but were these -- were these defendants involved in that --"
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,403.052,405.178,They were not present at that meeting.
1966.118,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,454.33,469.647,"Do you say that if allowed to go to trial, you'll be able to prove that the defendant, Sourwine at that conference participated in a plan to use the police power and search warrants rather than subpoenas?"
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,469.647,471.364,"Absolutely, Justice Fortas."
1966.118,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.372,709.724,And what -- I didn't hear it.
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,709.724,710.547,I'm sorry Justice --
1966.118,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.547,711.519,And something --
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,711.519,711.7,Oh!
1966.118,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.999,719.597,I see.
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,719.597,721.686,-- they're on that party during this action.
1966.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,721.686,722.725,Mr. -- Mr. Kinoy --
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,722.725,722.742,Yes Chief Justice?
1966.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,722.742,725.056,Would you address yourself a little more to the --
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,725.056,725.559,"Certainly, right."
1966.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,725.559,726.258,-- of the following.
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,726.258,727.151,Certainly Your Honor.
1966.118,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,727.151,731.276,It will be Mr. Robb is pretty much out of position.
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,731.276,733.521,I -- I apologize.
1966.118,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,833.575,835.198,Who -- who is Rogers then Mr. --
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,835.198,836.343,I'm sorry.
1966.118,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.213,1042.599,Are these -- these facts are all --
1966.118,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,1042.599,1051.47,All in the record they come out of the testimony of Mr. Sourwine and affidavits and I believe they are uncontested.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3038.232,3043.441,Mr. Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3157.243,3180.06,"That, even if that's true, if you're wrong about your -- on your first point then if they were as co-conspirators, they were co-conspirators in the -- in the -- in the unlawful seizure out in Louisiana then they are -- then they would still be liable even if they would have immunity of -- with respect to the issuance of the subpoena, wouldn't that be right?"
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3180.06,3186.709,"Yes, but I think that had to be something shown besides the issuance of the subpoena then there's nothing, nothing whatever."
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3186.961,3188.542,Because there hasn't been a trial yet.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3188.542,3189.106,I beg -- I beg your pardon?
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3189.106,3190.559,There hasn't been a trial yet.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3190.559,3191.212,No sir.
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3192.096,3196.592,The complaint does alleged that the -- that they were members of this conspiracy.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3196.592,3198.66,"It alleges that -– yes, sir."
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3198.66,3206.466,To -- to violate the Fourth Amendment rights and perhaps the First Amendment rights of the -- of the petitioners.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3206.466,3211.859,"That is correct on a motion for summary judgment, the allegation of the complaint is not enough, there must be something more."
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3211.859,3214.475,I understand that.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3214.475,3214.842,Now --
1966.118,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3214.842,3220.007,"Mr. Robb, Excuse me, is that -- that certain -- that certain decision final?"
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3221.374,3224.107,I don't know about that sir.
1966.118,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3431.387,3432.944,"Mr. Robb, excuse me but --"
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3432.944,3434.592,I beg your pardon.
1966.118,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3434.592,3437.959,Page 5 of the brief here --
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3437.959,3439.453,Which brief is Your Honor speaking of?
1966.118,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3439.453,3443.696,I'm talking about the brief signed by the Solicitor General and you.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3443.696,3444.747,Yes.
1966.118,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3446.87,3459.696,"So you've got the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, a Communist front organization, should you call a Communist front organization, is that ever on the Attorney General's list?"
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3459.696,3461.094,I don't know sir.
1966.118,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3464.71,3466.196,Who do you work?
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3466.196,3477.817,"We are -- I'm referring here after investigation of SCEF, the subcommittee reported that SCEF had been established as an adjunct of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare."
1966.118,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3480.791,3488.284,And your brief is not suggesting that it is a Communist front organization then.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3488.284,3502.464,"Well, all I was saying is that this was in the report of the subcommittee which led Mr. Rogers when his committee began to investigate the same org -- same organization to get in touch with Mr. Sourwine."
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3837.298,3846.197,The rules of the committee give -- give that power to -- to a man on the position of Mr. Sourwine?
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3846.197,3862.925,"The -- the rules of the committee, may it please the Chief Justice, provided at that time that subpoenas could be issued by the Chairman and the practice of the committee at all times up until then was that the Chairman decided when the subpoena should be issued."
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3904.119,3909.803,Even -- even though the -- the subpoenas were in blank directed to no one?
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3909.803,3910.771,Yes sir.
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3910.771,3913.838,And referred to no particular records.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3913.838,3924.058,They was -- they were filled in at -- filled in by Mr. Sourwine prior to service of course.
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3924.075,3928.474,Yes but -- but after-- after they had been signed by the Chairman --
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3928.474,3928.892,Yes sir.
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3928.892,3929.368,Chairman.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3929.368,3929.846,Yes sir.
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3929.846,3931.891,"In other words, it was a blank --"
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3931.891,3932.192,Yes sir.
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3932.192,3933.047,A blank subpoena --
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3933.047,3933.324,Yes sir.
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3933.324,3940.578,-- that he could carry around with him and determine when and where and on whom he should serve it.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3940.578,3942.893,"After he got the authority of the Chairman, yes sir."
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3942.893,3943.43,Yes.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3948.177,3950.072,"After he got the Chairman's authority, yes sir."
1966.118,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3950.072,3952.086,"Yes, but that is the authority that the government gave him."
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3952.086,3953.807,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1966.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3953.807,3962.271,Well Mr. -- did he speak to Chairman -- Chairman Eastland about securing these specific records?
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3962.271,3963.383,Yes sir.
1966.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3963.383,3966.888,And -- and the Chairman authorized to get this particular records.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3966.888,3967.521,Yes.
1966.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3967.933,3972.703,"It wasn't any rule of the authority to him, this -- it will get any records you want him --"
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3973.35,3972.703,Oh!
1966.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3973.981,3981.4,And the -- the authorizations take this subpoena and go get these records except that they could not describe the specific records.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3981.4,3981.525,Oh!
1966.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3982.634,3985.007,"I know, that -- but they were filled in last -- it was filled in later."
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3985.007,3985.176,That's correct.
1966.118,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3985.176,3987.342,When the Chairman signed it they decided they could not describe it.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,3987.342,3988.724,That's correct.
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4131.149,4133.337,"In the meantime, copies had been made up, aren't they?"
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,4133.337,4135.357,"Yes sir,"
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4135.357,4137.904,And those copies are now where?
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,4137.904,4143.312,They're in the possession of the Senate committee and not these respondents.
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4143.312,4148.187,Just one set of copies or several sets made?
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,4148.187,4150.55,"Frankly, I don't know Your Honor."
1966.118,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4150.595,4151.39,The record doesn't show.
1966.118,1,40351,roger_robb,,4154.714,4154.857,Oh!
1966.118,2,16337,arthur_kinoy,,4456.345,4458.718,57.
1966.118,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4458.718,4459.629,And going back a bit.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4469.044,4469.656,Yes sir.
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4490.811,4492.712,It should be this is not correct.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4495.178,4495.438,Yes.
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4495.438,4497.153,-- next sentence I think.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4499.217,4508.298,"Yes, the federal judge whatever had no jurisdiction under any circumstances because I might point out that certainly the records --"
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4508.298,4509.524,Senate.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4509.524,4525.157,When they were brought to the District of Columbia as our friends have demonstrated were within the jurisdiction of the United State District Court for this district and I assume that that was known to Senator Eastland and Mr. Sourwine.
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4525.157,4533.215,"Well, at the time though of this testimony on page 57, the records were across the river or whatever boundary is that can cross in -- in Mississippi --"
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4533.215,4536.002,"Yes, across the state line, yes."
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4536.002,4538.538,Across the state line of Mississippi.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4556.451,4564.206,"Well, he said that he -- he said frankly, that was in his mind that if anybody who is going to get sued it was going to be he and Senator -- him and Senator --"
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4564.206,4568.029,"Well, they're going to fix it so he could then very well be sued on these records and in that Court."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4568.029,4571.036,"Well, he could be sued here of course."
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4571.036,4573.42,"So he's -- well, the result is he is sued here."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4573.42,4574.017,Yes.
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4575.172,4578.385,So I guess he got his wish.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4578.385,4582.618,"Now, I might say yes, that is -- that's one thing we're sure of."
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4628.797,4636.845,I -- I tried to pursue that within these questions very well with Mr. Kinoy.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4661.111,4661.963,I know.
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4661.963,4665.336,"-- independently of the other, if I correctly understood you"
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4665.336,4673.672,"As I understand their complaint, Your Honor, their complaint is that -- that they alleged that this taking of the records across the state line was a part of the conspiracy."
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4679.155,4702.386,"I can stand that but he says that, “Let's suppose that the conspiracy were only to -- for the Mr. Sourwine and Senator Eastland to take the records after they have been unlawfully seized by the Louisiana officers."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4712.726,4713.147,"Well, that this is --"
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4713.147,4714.336,That's his contention as I understand --
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4714.336,4717.505,"If this is his theory, it's a new theory that I never heard before because along this brief --"
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4717.505,4724.419,I -- I may be wrong about it but I assume -- that's why I ask him the question and that's what I understood his answer.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4724.419,4748.292,"Now, I might add that the -- the affidavits of Mr. Sourwine's deposition were not mere naked denials as our friend suggest but they were detailed in circumstantial statements by everybody who had knowledge of the facts of reciting exactly of what the relevant actions and statements of those people had been."
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4880.262,4882.509,I suppose that what they're really saying --
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4882.509,4883.411,I beg your pardon?
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4883.411,4905.633,"What they're really saying may be, if I understand Mr. Kinoy, that they're entitled to go to a jury to see whether the jury will infer from the various meetings that were held that such a conspiracy or understanding did exist."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,4934.417,4936.414,"That's what they say, Your Honor."
1966.118,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5115.898,5117.804,Does that rob off on the counsel too?
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5117.804,5118.85,I beg your pardon?
1966.118,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5118.85,5120.024,Does that immunity rob off --
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5120.024,5120.886,I think it does.
1966.118,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5120.886,5121.082,-- on the counsel?
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5121.082,5123.794,"Yes, I think it should and does, yes sir."
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5123.794,5143.497,"Mr. Robb, are you relying on the -- on the Speech and Debate Clause itself or on the -- what I know is thought was a more broad -- broader and more generalized immunity but perhaps less complete of -- of Tenney against Brandhove and Barr against Matteo."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5143.497,5143.896,Well --
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5143.896,5146.159,-- upon which you're relying on both or do you think --
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5146.159,5159.086,"We rely upon, so far as Senator Eastland is concerned, we think the issuance of this subpoena, these subpoenas was clearly within the legitimate sphere of his legislative activities and duties."
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5161.239,5163.559,So with respect to him you're relying in a --
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5163.559,5164.105,Legislative --
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5164.105,5165.742,Basically on the Speech and Debate Clause.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5165.742,5166.142,Yes sir.
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5166.142,5169.197,Not on the general doctrine of legislative immunity as found in Tenney against Brandhove --
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5169.197,5169.786,No.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5169.786,5170.288,-- is that it?
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5170.288,5189.725,"Now, with respect to Mr. Sourwine, we say that all that he did in examining the SCEF records taking to Senator Eastland and recommend the issuance of a subpoena, serving the subpoena, causing the records to be moved to Washington."
1966.118,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5212.382,5215.585,Perhaps it should be tried if there is a question of the fact.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5216.999,5217.779,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5223.557,5224.981,And so what follows from that?
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5224.981,5243.307,"We follow from this, if it please Your Honor, that as the Court pointed out in the Barr case and other case as Howard case, a committee on executive must acts through agents and assistance and counsel."
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5269.365,5276.802,That is on -- is he protected you say then by the -- explicitly by the Speech and Debate Clause or just by the general doctrine of legislative immunity?
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5276.802,5283.253,I would say partly by the general doctrine although it's six and one and a half does in the other--
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5283.253,5286.26,"No, I haven't understood that it was exactly six and one and a half does in the other."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5287.587,5287.748,"Yes, I think."
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5287.748,5292.925,The one that's more explicit and perhaps more complete and the other is broader and perhaps less complete.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5292.925,5300.835,"But I think it would be anomalous, may it please Your Honor, to hold that the deputy or ranked administrator which I think with Mr. Barr's provision --"
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5300.835,5302.0,Yes.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5302.0,5307.762,-- would be immune whereas the general counsel of the congressional committee was not.
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5307.762,5310.501,Immune with respect to defamation --
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5310.501,5311.313,-- damages --
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5311.313,5312.637,Defamation in that case.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5312.637,5314.805,"Yes, damages."
1966.118,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5314.805,5316.006,Damages with defamation.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5316.006,5318.56,Yes sir.
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5348.234,5360.317,But why do you make up a quote from Tenney against Brandhove on page 38 of your brief?
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5360.317,5360.418,"Well, I said that --"
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5360.418,5364.178,Isn't that suggests a difference in the two?
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5364.178,5380.748,"Well, if I -- if can't entirely understand that except that for a -- it says that the privilege extended to a legislator is entitled to a greater respect and not extend it a subordinate."
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5385.709,5397.527,"No, but it says -- it says that the legislator -- the member of the legislature has a higher type of quality or something --"
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5397.527,5398.224,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5398.224,5405.313,-- and privilege than where an official -- then -- then an official has who has many acumen on behalf --
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5405.313,5424.9,"I can see how, may it please Your Honor, if you took this hypothetical question, I take it that for a no speech made on the floor of the Congress could a senator or a member of the House be sued and have to respond in damages for libel in those cases."
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5440.358,5443.153,"Well, it did seem a little trouble here I'm afraid."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5443.153,5443.967,I beg your pardon?
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5443.967,5446.63,"I said, I think that leads into some trouble here."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5471.58,5477.975,"Well, if that's what you had, may it please Your Honor in the Wheeldin case, Wheelding against Wheeler."
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5557.893,5603.022,"Well, and that -- and that gets you into a problem because his contention is that the -- Senator Eastland and Mr. Sourwine took over appropriate for the uses of this committee if you will, papers and records which Senator Eastland and Mr. Sourwine by that time, I suppose, knew had been held to be unlawfully seized, is there -- by that -- by the time of it's proceeding before Judge Ainsworth it is true, isn't it, that there had been state court decision saying that this material was unlawfully seized."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5603.705,5606.048,I think -- I'm not sure.
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5606.048,5614.826,"Well, that's my recollection so that in -- in terms of the sequence of events, if I understand Mr. Kinoy."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5644.467,5644.585,Oh!
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5664.163,5669.18,"No, I am assuming that they took over the papers though after their administrative adjudication."
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5669.18,5670.72,Precisely.
1966.118,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5671.07,5672.659,That the raid was unlawful.
1966.118,3,40351,roger_robb,,5672.659,5673.805,Precisely.
1966.118,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5781.653,5784.945,Mr. Kinoy.
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,5784.945,5785.57,May it please the Court.
1966.118,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5909.309,5913.811,"I don't understand, and Mr. Robb contested that."
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,5918.491,5920.745,"Well, I would think that if Mr. Robb --"
1966.118,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5920.745,5922.581,I may be wrong but that's the way I understood it.
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,5922.581,5922.782,Right.
1966.118,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6065.265,6073.424,"Mr. Kinoy, the state court decision holding the search and seizure illegal prior to the proceedings before the citation--"
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6073.424,6075.431,On Friday.
1966.118,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6075.431,6076.012,Sir?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6076.012,6080.721,In Friday of our -- of the -- the removal was on Sunday.
1966.118,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6084.736,6088.854,And the proceedings before Judge Ainsworth are when?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6088.854,6094.596,"Sunday morning when he directed a telegram and Monday morning before on the TRO, yes."
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6094.596,6100.346,"Mr. Kinoy, how about the equitable part of your course of action, your injunction."
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6102.93,6108.426,"No, I -- I think, that's argued in full in the brief with just a word on that Justice Stewart since you raised the question."
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6163.597,6172.708,"That -- that the originals and -- and mine is wrong in thinking that the undisputed facts are, that the originals have been returned to your client."
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6172.708,6173.115,That's right.
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6173.115,6177.479,And that the copies are in the possession not on these respondents but rather of the Senate --
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6177.479,6178.32,"No, Justice Stewart."
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6187.559,6188.098,Well --
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6188.098,6188.797,We don't know.
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6188.797,6196.29,"Well, isn't the -- aren't there statements under oaths which are uncontradicted to the effect that those are the facts?"
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6196.29,6198.001,"Justice Stewart, we had no opportunity contradicting that --"
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6198.001,6198.936,"No, just --"
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6198.936,6199.283,No.
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6199.283,6200.288,Could you answer the question?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6200.288,6203.487,"There are statements that those were the only records, yes Justice Stewart."
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6203.487,6204.095,Under oath?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6204.095,6205.086,Under oath.
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6215.821,6217.177,I understand.
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6221.426,6225.7,"That's right, and our position simply on that is that we are entitled to a hearing on that."
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6225.7,6226.263,I see.
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6226.263,6227.509,Yes sir.
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6227.509,6238.88,"You don't -- you don't take issue and I -- I suppose you couldn't do with the proposition that if the facts are as represented, your injunction has to fail because it -- it would work --"
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6238.88,6239.028,"No, we don't make issue."
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6239.028,6239.842,-- would be impossible (Voice Overlap)
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6239.842,6241.617,We say we are entitled to a hearing on that question.
1966.118,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6241.617,6242.264,Right.
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6242.264,6243.848,"Mr. Kinoy, may I ask you just one question."
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6255.228,6256.549,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6256.549,6270.839,"But if they did not, nevertheless, that they are truly participating in the violation of the Fourth Amendment because with knowledge that these materials had been illegally seized."
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6274.348,6275.284,"Mr. Justice Brennan, that --"
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6275.284,6276.042,-- if I can get them.
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6276.042,6277.141,That's an alternative --
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6277.141,6278.003,It's an alternative argument.
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6278.003,6280.314,An alternative argument and a subsidiary argument.
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6289.663,6304.052,"But suppose if you are not entitled to hearing on the issue of the original conspiracy on this alternative argument to gather the facts of already has found to blow that they did have knowledge, that they have been illegal --"
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6304.052,6305.994,"It would seem so,Your Honor, yes."
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6305.994,6318.628,"Well, because of -- I forgotten though it come out very similar with Dombrowski and Pfister but what were the dates of those seizures in relation to the date of the subpoena."
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6318.628,6319.174,Yes.
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6319.174,6320.04,Were they before?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6320.04,6321.867,The seizures were on October 4.
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6321.867,6326.37,And when was -- when was the Louisiana Court decisions question the --
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6326.37,6328.075,On the 24th --
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6328.075,6329.016,Of October?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6329.016,6331.528,"24th of October, the arrest warrants request, yes."
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6331.528,6334.731,And these -- and these -- and these subpoenas are dated when?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6334.731,6338.982,"The subpoenas were dated October 4th, the same time."
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6341.791,6352.418,"Well, but what I want to get clear is the actual action of the Louisiana courts questioning the arrest warrants was subsequent to the seizures of these materials."
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6352.418,6353.585,That's right.
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6360.818,6364.185,"Well, you mean of -- of removing them, that Sunday night, what date was that?"
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6364.185,6366.672,That was the 27th.
1966.118,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6366.672,6371.053,This was after the action of the Louisiana Court question the respondents?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6371.053,6372.234,That's right.
1966.118,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6372.234,6376.356,But the -- the actual service of the subpoenas was before the action?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6376.356,6378.9,"That's right, Your Honor."
1966.118,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6378.9,6381.253,Which commanded the state officials to turn them over?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6381.253,6381.523,That's right.
1966.118,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6381.523,6413.626,"So your argument would be that even if the documents had been specifically listed in the subpoenas and then signed by Senator Eastland and even if there had been no contact whatsoever between the state and federal officials up until -- until after the seizure by the state officials and then the federal people were notified and then they issued a subpoena, even so you would say you were entitled to recover because they knew when the service -- not when they serve the subpoena but when they actually removed them."
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6413.626,6413.991,"That's right, Justice White."
1966.118,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6413.991,6415.551,That they have been improperly seized?
1966.118,4,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6415.551,6415.784,Yes.
