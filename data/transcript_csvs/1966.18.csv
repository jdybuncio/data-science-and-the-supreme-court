1966.18,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.188,"Number 18, Utah Pie Company, Petitioner, versus Continental Baking Company et al."
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,18.909,22.29,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,153.633,159.347,"There were -- there were separate verdicts, were there, against each one of these three defendants?"
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,165.063,169.349,There were separate verdicts Justice Stewart.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,208.94,209.717,-- three defendants.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,209.717,210.497,-- respondents.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,235.096,236.923,For a separate amount against that each would be --
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,236.923,242.219,For separate amounts against each of them and for separate litigation expenses as I had given them to the Court.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,245.921,250.168,And that was after the jury had covered the amount of actual damages now.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,250.168,253.19,"After the judge had covered the amount on the jury's verdict, yes."
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.19,258.57,"I see, within the -- this $88,000 and $152,000 and $93,000 --"
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,258.57,258.98,Yes.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.98,261.067,-- represents the trebling by the judge --
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,261.067,263.573,Represent the trebling by the judge (Voice Overlap)
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,263.573,267.224,"-- actual damages and then plus, plus some cost, is that it?"
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,267.224,267.494,Yes.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.41,305.753,And divide it.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,305.753,308.288,And then allocated of course to the amount of the judge.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,309.708,309.881,I see.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,311.727,316.648,"That's the way, that's the manner in which it was done."
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,332.506,338.679,"May I ask you though, does that have to be determined as each individual defendant here?"
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,338.679,339.961,"Yes, it was determined as --"
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.961,356.114,"Or in other words -- and in other words, if you are right that the Court of the Appeals were wrong, it would require us to say that the Court of Appeals was wrong in each individual case which may mean they might conclude the Court of Appeals is right as to one, but wrong as to two."
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,356.114,358.217,I think that's correct sir.
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,367.044,369.197,I think it was fair to try this out.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,369.197,370.721,That's correct.
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.964,374.41,Then a -- then a record desires this table in this picture.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,374.41,374.749,Yes.
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,375.623,377.03,Do you have to read all of that?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,377.03,377.333,No.
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,391.351,395.1,"But I'm curious, why was it necessary to go to the expense of cleaning such an --"
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,395.1,401.568,"Well, one of the very expensive thing, if Your Honor please, it cost the petitioner 50,000 -- $50,000."
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,402.519,406.448,But the issues for us don't require us to examine all that record.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,406.448,416.042,"Well, the issues -- the issues for the Court, of course, is whether or not the evidence was sufficient and this was all of the evidence that was presented to the -- to the jury."
1966.18,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,450.666,464.344,May I ask you -- may I ask you Mr. Alioto was there any difference in your opinion between the counsels as to what should be the credit for purposes with this Court's review?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,464.344,467.849,I -- I don't recall any difference to these opinions with respect to that.
1966.18,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,467.849,475.946,"So, it's agreed by both sides that you cannot."
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,475.946,477.593,I believe that is the situation.
1966.18,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,488.998,492.683,And I just feel real sorry for whoever has to pay that amount.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,492.683,494.889,"Well, we -- we are -- we are hopeful of course."
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,516.272,533.213,"But if I -- if understand you correctly, it's because the issue with sufficiency of the evidence, that the appellant should felt that you could not risk, not putting the entire record even though you think yourself and the appellate court doesn't have to examine the entire record to pass on the issues."
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,533.213,534.058,That's correct.
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,535.137,539.553,Is there anything that says that that should be done?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,539.553,539.897,"Well, no."
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,577.147,577.451,Well why is it?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,577.451,581.858,And then get in the Court of Appeals and say if the underlying documents aren't here then they fully rejected that.
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,581.858,582.19,Yes.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,592.465,593.814,We made an attempt --
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,593.814,596.624,You prepared 40 copies of these damages.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,596.624,605.061,We made an attempt to file an -- to file the invoices as original records in this Court and as I understand that from my associates that there was correspondence or some conversation with the clerk of the Court on this matter.
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.907,627.12,"Well, that was carried and applied to the Court for permission to do it, without trying to overcome the statute?"
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,627.12,629.038,"Well, we didn't apply it to the Court."
1966.18,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.137,651.74,"Well, I -- I frankly I am concerned with the expense of the litigation are just getting out of hand anyway."
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,662.727,665.358,"Well, we try to get this in as original records."
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.39,816.837,That was a -- Continental's counterclaim only?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,816.837,817.232,That's correct.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,817.232,818.02,The other two --
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,818.02,828.881,"The other two did not file a counterclaim, just Continental and they got a dollar from the jury, the trial court granted a motion N. O. V. and the Court of Appeals reversed it and come down on the ground of no motion for a directive verdict as they say."
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,828.881,830.783,So that's reversed now for a new trial?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,830.783,831.572,Or a new trial.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,831.572,833.318,And that's pending I suppose in the District Court.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,833.318,834.033,That's correct.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,834.055,834.971,Not before us.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,835.808,836.451,Not before this.
1966.18,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,836.451,838.758,You did not apply for certiorari on that?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,838.758,839.984,"On that, we did not."
1966.18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,853.492,856.379,"Mr. Alioto, we don't agree with you on the evidence."
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,860.979,861.333,Yes.
1966.18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.333,863.69,-- of questions which was in -- discussed in the last case?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,863.69,864.186,Yes.
1966.18,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.186,866.005,But only if we disagreed on that.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,866.005,866.612,That's correct.
1966.18,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,975.621,979.575,"Is that the -- when you say pie business, do I also understand frozen pie."
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,979.575,980.916,"Frozen pie, yes."
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,980.916,982.089,Frozen fruit pie?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,982.089,991.288,"The only product we're talking about are frozen fruit pies plus mince and pumpkins, we exclude the cream and the chocolate pie definitely."
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,992.694,993.618,Frozen pies.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,993.618,994.423,Basically that's correct.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,994.423,996.596,Both eight and nine-inch?
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,996.596,1001.536,Eight-inch basically was involved here although there was some evidence of the nine-inch pie in the industry.
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1001.536,1002.769,"That was in the Denver market, I think."
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,1002.769,1006.317,I think in -- in the San Francisco market on the nine-inch pie
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1006.317,1007.398,Eight-inch here in Salt Lake.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,1007.398,1009.3,"Eight-inch is the basic, the standard --"
1966.18,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1009.3,1009.609,Right.
1966.18,0,28781,joseph_l_alioto,,1009.609,1010.713,-- size we're talking about.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4786.26,4795.844,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4824.491,4828.378,Why -- why do you say that the way -- did we limit the grant?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4828.378,4834.425,"The text of your grant Mr. Justice Fortas was in the same term as basically in both cases, the Neely case and in our case."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4845.418,4848.1,Well you heard -- you heard some colloquy and --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4848.1,4849.049,I heard some colloquy --
1966.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4849.049,4849.233,Where did you get that?
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4849.233,4852.086,"That well, sometimes we don't -- we don't do exactly --"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4852.086,4860.428,"That's correct but I would submit to the Court that it's not necessary, necessarily necessary to consider the merits in order to consider the procedural questions that brought it here."
1966.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4860.428,4860.882,It may not -- I thought you --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4860.882,4861.939,You can assume --
1966.18,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4861.939,4866.717,I thought you were suggesting that -- that the issue of the merits was not before us under our grants.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4866.717,4867.794,"Not at all, not at all."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4872.255,4874.213,"Well, explain that to me, will you?"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4874.213,4885.121,"Well, it seems to me Mr. Justice White that as you have another area Mr. Justice White, in other cases you have taken a case on simply the procedural question putting aside the all the merits of the case."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4885.121,4885.829,"Yes, but we didn't --"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4885.829,4886.464,You didn't do it here.
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4886.464,4888.516,Now that they are here how can we put it aside?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4888.516,4891.966,"Well, in effect you can say it seems to me without using this language perhaps."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4895.666,4897.742,I hope you're going to discuss it here.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4897.742,4898.312,I certainly am.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4956.053,4957.856,Did they have a plant there?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4957.856,4959.659,It did not -- they had plant in Watsonville.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4962.225,4975.162,But that -- that -- are you telling us that the computation of cost did not permitted economic of delivery of those pies from the Watsonville plant to the Utah market?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4975.162,4979.888,Mr. Justice Fortas it did not get the Watsonville plant in the operation until late 1960s.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4986.487,4995.579,"Well, I asked you, you -- you said that Continental had no market position in competition with Utah Pie."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,4995.579,4996.181,Yes.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4996.181,5001.399,And you said that -- but what -- and I asked you about the plant.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5004.397,5008.967,"Well, they had a co-packing operation in California for a time in 1959."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5027.811,5032.695,"Then why -- why are you saying that, I'm sorry but I don't follow you."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5057.725,5059.705,I didn't really mean to say anything more than that.
1966.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5097.573,5098.658,Where is that?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5098.658,5102.846,It says in Appendix II of my brief Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5108.166,5110.117,I don't -- I don't understand what you mean.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5115.34,5117.564,"The cost, the laid down --"
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5117.564,5119.89,"What -- what -- what claim, what cost?"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5119.89,5123.449,"The laid down cost, the Continental in Salt Lake City market."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5126.357,5127.096,To the cost.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5127.096,5127.668,The cost --
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5127.668,5129.321,From which -- from which plant would you think to --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5129.321,5130.692,From any plant.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5152.859,5154.168,I thought you were in your example.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5154.168,5155.539,"No, no."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5253.92,5258.424,I know but Mr. Alioto said that it was six weeks and again I misunderstood him.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5258.424,5263.415,"He said, Your Honor that the quotation lasted for two weeks but Safeway bought a six-week supply."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5263.415,5265.158,"Well, is that true or not?"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5265.158,5266.075,Assuming it's true.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5284.542,5286.454,Well look.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5288.461,5289.349,Nothing.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5289.66,5292.903,"You mean, Continental went out of -- out of the business in that market?"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5292.903,5293.65,It?
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5293.65,5294.273,Huh?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5294.273,5297.576,It stayed in the market quoting an unrealistically high price.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5297.576,5297.821,Continental?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5297.821,5300.174,It is right after this $2.85 price.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5300.174,5301.756,Let's get back to it.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5314.538,5316.169,"No, everybody sir."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5316.169,5320.691,"Everybody for six weeks, for two weeks you say."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5324.091,5325.509,"Basically, bought sir."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5325.509,5333.245,And was that six weeks plan for all of the Safeway divisions in the Utah market?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5333.245,5337.207,"The one Safeway division which encompasses all of its stores into the Salk Lake City market, that's right."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5337.207,5338.282,Alright.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5341.769,5352.15,"Well, to get into that sir, I better explain to you that the way the competitor works in this industry is you have an unrealistically high list price then everybody quotes short-term price promotions off that list price."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5352.15,5352.855,Well not --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5352.855,5354.568,"So that the answer is yes, it went back to the list price."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5354.568,5356.154,"Alright, you answered trying to get it."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5356.154,5357.485,"I'm sorry, it went back to the list price."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5357.485,5373.48,"It went in of the market with a low price and they sold to Safeway and they sold the six-week supply, at the end of the two weeks promotion period or whatever you want to call it then Continental raised its price."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5373.48,5376.122,"Right, so the brought it back automatically because there was only a two-week offer."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5376.122,5380.71,"Well, what does the record show about what happened to Utah Pie during this period?"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5380.71,5381.341,That's what I'm going to say.
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5415.275,5419.712,Did -- did Utah however get the Safeway account back?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5419.712,5421.926,"Utah, Mr. Justice White never had it."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5421.926,5422.174,Why?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5422.174,5423.614,Utah --
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5423.614,5437.754,"You've my question so that they -- they didn't get -- they didn't -- even if Continental went out of the market, Utah Pie never -- was able to sell pie to Safeway?"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5437.754,5443.608,"Well, see these record stops in September 1961, almost immediately after this little promotion period."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5462.791,5465.253,What was the price during the two weeks promotion?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5465.253,5468.868,"$2.85 Mr. Justice Fortas, and --"
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5468.868,5470.248,$2.85 --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5470.248,5470.432,Yes.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5470.432,5472.566,-- for the bigger pie.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5473.882,5474.562,I'm sorry.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5477.324,5478.522,It's Continental's price?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5478.522,5480.557,"That's correct, on a 22-ounce pie."
1966.18,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5480.557,5482.629,"That was $2.89, I believe."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5482.629,5490.482,"Well, in fact you have for a full truck price Mr. Justice Douglas, its $2.85 per lesser quantities, a quarter truck prices would be $2.89."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5490.482,5491.089,Alright.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5491.089,5497.499,And if -- when Continental quoted that price Utah Pies price for a larger pie was $3.10.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5504.795,5510.313,Was that after Continental had made its deal with Safeway?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5510.313,5520.06,Safeway had -- had permitted itself to buy a truckload from Continental at the time that Safeway heard through the marketplace that Utah Pie had a lower price.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5530.495,5550.372,"Well, if -- if you're putting yourself as problem that arises with respect to a price cut for the purpose of obtaining entry into a new market, I think we've got -- that that's a very in -- to me that's a very interesting problem."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5575.421,5596.216,The thrust -- the thrust of what I'm trying to say is that the Robinson-Patman Act in proscribing price discriminations which may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly does not proscribe a two-week price discrimination by a marginal seller trying to get some business entered -- and enter that market and to create competition.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5596.216,5597.372,That's what I want to find out.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5599.377,5600.852,"There are cases on that, Your Honor."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5609.14,5610.879,But no cases with this Court?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5610.879,5611.55,Excuse me?
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5611.55,5612.5,There are no cases in this Court.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5612.5,5616.677,This Court has never decided on its merits in the area by discrimination case.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5616.677,5630.074,"And the narrowed question then that this problem puts is whether there is a requisite prospective effect, present or prospective effect on competition."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5630.074,5630.867,Precisely.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5631.206,5635.755,And what you're arguing is that this was all de minimis as shown by this record.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5635.755,5644.68,"Well, I'm not saying there's so much meaning, I'm just saying this kind of -- of a flurry, a promotional flurry doesn't -- doesn't -- is not proscribed by the Robinson-Patman Act."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5680.891,5681.437,Or was the error --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5681.437,5682.485,-- which respondents are trying to do.
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5682.485,5686.308,"-- was the error in this regard then made in the trial court, how about the instructions?"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5691.047,5691.951,"No, no, it didn't Mr. Justice White."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5691.951,5696.282,Did you make any (Voice Overlap) did you question the instructions in this respect?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5696.282,5706.648,"Very definitely, I ask about the instructions which were taken out of the language of the cases which said in effect that short terms sporadic price discriminations are not un -- are not unlawful."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5706.648,5707.563,Were they all turned down?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5707.563,5707.867,Oh!
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5710.098,5716.272,But this isn't -- this isn't the ground on which the -- as I understand it the Court of Appeals reversed.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5718.365,5718.491,Oh!
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5718.549,5719.89,-- or different rule in the instructions.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5719.89,5720.49,"No, I didn't say that."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5730.156,5731.151,Suppose the record show --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5731.151,5732.028,Under the law --
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5732.028,5733.302,I beg your pardon.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5754.506,5758.792,2 (a) Mr. Justice Fortas is aimed at not the protection of individual competitors.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5760.532,5762.53,"Well, that's your -- your position."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5762.53,5762.88,Well --
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5762.88,5764.129,I -- I'm not sure of the case --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5764.129,5765.24,The appellate courts have said that.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5765.24,5768.434,"Well, the case to make that clear, but how about my question?"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5768.434,5776.082,"Well, I would adopt the appellate court's interpretation of Section 2 (a) which says we are -- the statute is aimed at protection of competition genuine."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5776.082,5776.382,I see.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5776.382,5779.019,The individual competitor may sink or swim in the competitor prices.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5779.019,5779.757,I see.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5796.251,5797.371,"Well, you -- you got to distinguish the situation --"
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5797.371,5799.844,"No, you don't have the ca -- you don't have the case anyway."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5799.844,5800.016,"Well, you got --"
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5800.016,5807.146,You have to show -- you have to show damage to competition whatever that concept may mean.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5807.146,5810.338,"Yes Your Honor, except for something like that Maryland Baking case applies."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5830.795,5832.957,"Well, I thought that was the question you're asking."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5832.957,5833.554,"No, no."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5835.957,5840.884,All that result in driving a competitor out of business.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5840.884,5844.508,"With -- with the effect, excuse me, with the effect of creating monopoly as a result?"
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5845.999,5858.522,"Well, do you think that driving a competitor out of business and your -- your position as I understand you is that that would not make up the case under 2 (a)."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5858.522,5866.081,"If you're assuming sir that there were 13 sellers in this market before the two-week discrimination, there are 13 sellers in the market, after this two-week discrimination, yes."
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5867.1,5871.046,I think very well would be assuming that this goes to say you drive one of my business.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5871.046,5871.312,No.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5876.898,5877.341,I see.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5877.341,5878.661,It's not -- and before that it's not in the market.
1966.18,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5878.661,5883.667,Your -- your position is that would and they -- you have 13 before and 13 after?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5888.022,5890.801,"On -- on a two-week, yes, that my position is that."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5974.967,5979.912,Was there a price discrimination here that like your client?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5979.912,5981.239,For the -- in the two-week period time?
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5981.239,5982.454,Yes.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,5982.454,5988.426,"If you assume that advertising allowances are not price cuts, this $4 of invoice just show a price discrimination."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6001.704,6005.687,Were there were evidence of that -- that somebody could conclude there was a price discrimination?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6005.687,6005.917,Sure.
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6013.771,6017.284,And one that was unjustified by meeting competition?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6017.284,6018.483,"Yes, yes."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6021.79,6023.027,"Well, I didn't say it was, I'm just trying to get --"
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6023.027,6024.733,Yes.
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6035.083,6048.437,Well what if -- what if coming in with -- for two weeks it triggered a price war and wherever it precluded the -- drove the prices down and then know you could never end -- nobody could get the prices up again?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6048.437,6051.034,"Well, that was basically a conspiracy case."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6052.741,6055.811,But if he doesn't need before the 2 (a) case doesn't need to prove conspiracy --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6055.811,6060.317,No we have to prove that the discrimination charged by Continental had certain effects.
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6060.317,6060.478,Oh!
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6074.884,6077.605,A mere price is going down isn't a proof of that adverse competitive effect.
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6081.47,6081.847,And --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6081.847,6085.477,"A mere fact that price is going down is usually considered to be competitive, Mr. Justice White."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6085.477,6090.613,"No, increase in volume doesn't present that -- doesn't present damage."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6090.613,6095.651,"No, I -- no, if you're talking about damage to him that's after he proves a violation of law (Voice Overlap)"
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6095.651,6096.184,-- lawsuit.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6096.184,6097.126,Excuse me?
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6097.126,6099.429,Increase in volume just might increase your loses.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6099.429,6099.975,"Well, that's true."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6112.634,6112.768,Yes.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6122.106,6122.235,Well --
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6122.235,6127.55,"Mr. Justice Fortas poses you one case when you said yes it could, now I'm just posing you another."
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6127.55,6142.986,"Well, it -- it's not impossible Justice White but in second -- even in secondary level cases where of course the competitive effect is much more likely to be shown because one could -- one competitor who was buying for resale, he's buying at a higher price than this competitive right across the street."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6152.821,6154.575,Just as it ruled them of per se.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6154.575,6155.662,"Basically, that's what they said."
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6199.066,6199.255,So you are --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6199.255,6202.214,-- Section 2 (a) in an area case to proscribe your price differences.
1966.18,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6202.214,6209.207,Your position really is that on this evidence that the questions should never have gotten on the jury against Continental.
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6209.207,6210.997,"That's correct, that's correct."
1966.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6613.39,6625.814,Would a record of this size do you think that the -- the appellate court would be in as good position to determine whether a new trial should be granted as a man who spent weeks or maybe months trying the case?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6625.814,6640.532,"Well, Mr. Justice Warren, I firmly believe as I argued in my brief that if the appellate court was asked to decide the merit, it would hold that on the law there was insufficient evidence of an adverse competitive effect in the Denver market because there's nothing shown there -- it's just a pure legal question in other words, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1966.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6640.532,6640.928,Wouldn't that require --
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6640.928,6642.263,-- and they can make that decision.
1966.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6642.263,6644.26,Would that require him to read the record?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6644.26,6647.761,"Well, they have to read the record anyway in connection with their -- with their whole appellate process."
1966.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6647.761,6649.493,Do we have to read the whole record here now?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6649.493,6654.784,I have submitted to you that I don't believe you have to because I don't think you have to get into all of those facts.
1966.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6684.752,6689.878,Are there any facts stated in the Court's opinion which you object?
1966.18,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,6689.878,6690.821,"None, Your Honor."
1966.18,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6690.821,6699.396,None.
1966.18,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6699.396,6701.165,Mr. Billings.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6701.165,6704.992,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.18,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6761.911,6764.308,Do you object to the Court's statement of fact?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6764.308,6767.887,"No sir, I do not."
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6805.727,6807.339,And then what?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6811.343,6817.103,"Conclude that the Court of Appeals, Your Honor, was correct in its disposition of the case so far as Carnation is concerned."
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6817.103,6826.501,"On what basis, what part of the Court of Appeals, in finding that there was no evidence, not sufficient evidence to support the correct judgment of law?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6826.501,6827.482,Yes sir.
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6827.482,6829.773,"Well, then how can we do that without looking at the evidence."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6843.315,6843.857,"Well, what I'm saying is --"
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6843.857,6847.542,It is -- maybe there's some principle here that I'm missing.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6847.542,6850.407,"I didn't mean to skip that over rapidly, Your Honor."
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6862.492,6862.737,I know --
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6862.737,6863.285,That is I'm talking about --
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6863.285,6879.927,"They have a great difference between the facts as stated by the Court of Appeals and the evidence for example, your opponent was very careful to say and very insistent that there are other facts and you think some of it would be taken into account."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6899.886,6900.581,"Well, I think Your Honor --"
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6900.581,6906.434,It might be a very welcomed principle and -- but I'm not sure that I'm familiar with it.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6906.434,6906.525,Oh!
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6913.594,6915.023,"I though it did, he did."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6915.406,6915.441,But not --
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6915.441,6922.651,-- and the limited time here I thought he pointed -- tried to point some out and also got to try to point some more out on his brief.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6922.651,6930.503,That's true but the point I want to make is that those do not concern Carnation and that my task here this afternoon is to point out to you why?
1966.18,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6957.475,6960.536,Can I ask you one more question about the Court's opinion?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6960.536,6961.491,Yes sir.
1966.18,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6961.491,6982.502,"Supposed one would read the facts stated in the Court's opinion and reach the conclusion that those facts are true that there was a disputed question to go before the juries, would they have to read in the verdict?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6982.502,6995.968,I would say this Your Honor that so far as -- as the Carnation's concern that reading any further in this record with respect to it would not aid the Court in -- in determining that particular issue.
1966.18,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6996.284,6997.57,That was consensus?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,6997.57,6999.275,Yes.
1966.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7014.335,7017.279,Which are the Carnation products?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7017.279,7020.753,"The Simple Simon, the red line."
1966.18,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7020.753,7021.926,Yes.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7021.926,7026.077,And it had been in the Utah market since 1955.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7040.44,7043.414,"Now, Utah had been in the general pie market --"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7043.414,7043.439,Fresh pie.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7043.439,7044.55,And not in the frozen pie market?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7044.55,7046.484,"Not the frozen pie, just the fresh pie market, Your Honor."
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7046.484,7049.572,"It had been a family business and generally in the pie, making pie."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7049.572,7050.297,That's correct.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7050.297,7050.534,For some or so years.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7050.534,7051.71,Selling in grocery stores and so on.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7051.71,7057.943,"Selling in grocery stores, and it was in 1957, not until 1957 that they entered the frozen pie market?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7057.943,7058.53,That's correct.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7066.928,7067.638,They came in and --
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7067.638,7068.129,They came in and --
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7068.129,7070.523,Basically in Salt Lake City and the -- and the environment within the area.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7070.523,7071.462,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7132.382,7134.379,"What does that mean, is that a price level or what is it?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7134.476,7134.998,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7139.256,7141.488,"Okay, that is in dollars."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7141.488,7143.371,That's a little about $2 --
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7143.371,7146.189,That's $2 per case on the left (Voice Overlap) I can't figure those --
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7146.189,7149.17,There are six pies to a case.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7171.955,7173.637,"Where -- where was your plant, the plant --"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7173.637,7174.422,Los Angeles.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7176.678,7177.719,And that supplies this market?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7177.719,7178.185,Yes.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7287.883,7292.382,"I don't -- I don't quite understand the coordinates on that graph, and just so that I can have some basic understanding of --"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7292.382,7293.25,That's $2 a case.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7293.25,7294.808,"Those are prices per case, that --"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7294.808,7295.417,That's' correct sir.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7295.417,7298.985,"-- up and down in the left, and what's across in the bottom, J-A-J-O?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7298.985,7302.77,"This is the 59, this is 58, this is 66."
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7302.77,7305.99,"Well, what are those letters, J-A-J-O?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7305.99,7309.778,"January, April, July, October January, in other words this is supposed to --"
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7309.778,7309.865,Coding?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7309.865,7312.161,-- impact to space out the months.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7312.161,7313.103,Uh-hmm.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7313.103,7314.119,I'm sure this is number one.
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7315.387,7316.063,Yes.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7319.682,7320.399,"It's not shown, Your Honor."
1966.18,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7320.399,7321.077,Not shown in any the graph.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7321.077,7324.477,It shown map on page 25 of my brief.
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7324.477,7338.926,"Mr. Billings, that table -- that chart in the tables on 13 and 14, did they reflect your actual selling prices or do they include deals that you may have made the Safeway or others?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7338.926,7344.176,"The price is on page 13 and 14, these would reflect the deals."
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7344.176,7346.72,"You mean, you mean the deals are included in there?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7346.72,7348.434,This would be our net price in each.
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7348.434,7356.004,Because your second footnote does not indicate that to me on page 13 of your brief.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7357.849,7359.947,I don't understand what --
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7359.947,7367.044,"Well, I want to know whether these are the actual selling price, these prices for example which is sold to the large chains."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7367.044,7371.343,We sold Your Honor the same price to everyone.
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7393.608,7398.325,So we're not here talking about a promotional price reduction.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7398.325,7406.252,We're talking Your Honor at the net price at which the pies were sold in each market at all particular time.
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7406.252,7406.584,Right.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7421.776,7422.515,Yes sir.
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7422.515,7427.541,"But no such situation is presented here with respect to Carnation, so --"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7427.541,7427.935,No.
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7457.304,7467.372,Then in other words they are your usual ordinary customary prices minus whatever you take off to arrive at your promotional prices.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7467.372,7469.148,"That's correct sir, in each time."
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7469.552,7470.309,Thank you.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7470.309,7487.28,"And the only time, the record will show, the only time we ever approach Utah Pie as we -- and -- in February or March of 1960 after we have had two successive years of potential losses of volume and losses of markets."
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7539.778,7543.587,"Well, do I understand that those prices of yours are the same all over the United States?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7543.587,7545.133,"No sir, you -- they are not."
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7545.133,7547.379,Well was there a discrimination in price between --
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7547.379,7548.706,There was -- there was Your --
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7548.706,7551.711,-- your company between the Salt Lake City market and other markets?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7551.711,7554.735,From time to time there was.
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7571.906,7573.219,That's what I'm trying to get that.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7581.013,7581.154,The figures --
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7581.154,7583.671,-- and the figures reflected on that chart?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7583.671,7593.677,"The figures at one and two Your Honor are -- these are also like market prices, all through these tables and they are taken from actual invoices."
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7593.677,7595.577,As an average of this --
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7595.577,7595.808,Well --
1966.18,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7595.808,7607.811,"What are the points of time within these months when the prices were lower than the prices here stated, that's from the time you get at."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7607.811,7611.025,I doubt that that would be so.
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7704.519,7704.614,Oh!
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7722.505,7723.793,That may or may not have happened.
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7724.073,7725.932,"There is a discrimination there, isn't there?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7725.932,7726.968,"Oh, I won't question that."
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7733.211,7740.227,"And -- and if you're going to justify that discrimination and if the burden is on you to testify that discrimination, I suppose?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7740.227,7744.479,"Well, we don't -- there wasn't an issue about cost justification, Your Honor."
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7746.452,7754.57,"Well, your company has -- you say that your company has a general policy of selling at different prices in different markets depending on what the competition is."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7754.57,7756.689,"In that particular market, that's right."
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7756.689,7762.018,And even though you do not now say that you could cost justify it.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7762.018,7762.915,That's correct sir.
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7763.425,7766.503,What are the -- but you do say that you had justified it by meeting competition?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7766.503,7767.842,By meeting competition --
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7767.842,7773.6,"Even though, even though you don't feel that you're competing for any particular customers, that you're meeting prices?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7773.6,7778.075,We're meeting the general market level in each particular market.
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7804.195,7811.009,"What is -- what is the law in -- in Robinson-Patman Act cases, can you extend your market with that -- with that price discrimination?"
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7811.009,7811.551,"Well, as I understand --"
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7811.551,7813.578,Even though you're meeting competition?
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7813.578,7816.978,As I understand if you're meeting competition you extend your market.
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7824.195,7824.37,That even that --
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7824.37,7825.49,in each projector market.
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7825.49,7834.589,"That you can -- then you can, you -- you could -- you could even know it's discriminatory price, meet the price of a competitor in order to take his customer away from it, if you wanted to."
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7834.589,7836.708,Or to retain the customers you have.
1966.18,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7836.708,7837.606,Or to take one of them.
1966.18,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,7837.606,7850.775,"Well, in each market the customers, where evidence shows shift back and forth because there's no brand loyalty on that being this is purely a price item and these are all temporary price adjustments and they bounce from time to time."
1966.18,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7887.479,7895.655,Mr. Lamb.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,7895.655,7899.481,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8385.607,8385.829,Right.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8388.068,8390.051,That's not what Pet did Your Honor.
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8390.051,8393.348,I thought you said they brought out a lower priced pie?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8393.348,8402.384,"Yes, brought out the Swiss Miss pie which was a 20-ounce pie, it was of different quality and it was priced in relation to the 20 ounces as against the 24 ounces."
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8402.384,8406.112,"Well, as you stated Mr. Lamb perhaps I misunderstood you."
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8415.335,8424.432,The Market Research Corporation of Chicago made a study recommended to Pet that if they're going to stay in the frozen pie business and get into the proper position they have to make two pies --
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8424.432,8425.686,And I'm getting that -- getting that far --
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8425.686,8430.544,"One of an eight-inch, 24-ounce pie and two, an eight-inch, 20-ounce pie."
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8430.544,8433.144,I'm getting that far as against the small companies.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8433.144,8451.388,"That's -- get sufficient volume and then probably, and reduce their advertising cost and add innovation such as -- of trade problems combining our shipments and so forth and reduce their cost such as was done in the Balian Ice Cream case and they would bring themselves back into a proper position."
1966.18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8735.178,8738.739,Well to what -- to what point is this argument though that there was no damage to Utah Pie?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8738.739,8742.069,"No damage done to Utah, no damage done to the competition."
1966.18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8742.069,8743.128,And not that there wasn't any discrimination --
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8743.128,8744.397,"And therefore, no (Voice Overlap)"
1966.18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8744.397,8746.233,Not that there wasn't a discrimination?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8746.233,8753.138,"There was a difference in price and based on the definition of Anheuser-Busch of this Court, you could call it a discrimination."
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8765.122,8767.715,Frost N Flame was a Utah brand?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8767.715,8769.999,That this was their fight brand.
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8769.999,8771.444,"Yes, what were their other brands?"
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8772.514,8777.903,"Well they had a -- Sonny Boy, Your Honor up in the Northwest and then their Utah brand here, this brand."
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8788.033,8789.18,That was the Utah.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8789.18,8790.533,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8790.533,8793.341,And the Frost 'N Flame was a --
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8793.341,8798.236,"Well, that was a private labeled manufactured by Utah for associated groceries."
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8798.236,8798.478,Right.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8801.359,8807.913,"Well, this is one of them, Frost 'N Flame, and the Sonny Boy was another one and May Fresh was another one."
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8807.913,8808.307,Yes.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8808.307,8812.14,As far as the Utah Pie Company was concerned.
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8812.14,8821.062,"Now when you're telling us that your client never, not only never beat but never met their prices --"
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8821.062,8821.721,"Right, Your Honor."
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8821.721,8825.288,Are you talking about their whole line or on an average or each of their lines?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8825.288,8827.958,Talking about the whole line.
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8831.708,8835.176,Individually and collectively and you made that -- two brands.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8835.176,8835.888,That's correct.
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8840.904,8844.003,And -- and was Bel-air the equivalent of Swiss Miss or the other way?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8844.003,8844.186,No.
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8846.544,8846.611,It's a quality --
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8846.611,8848.689,"It's an eight-inch, 24-ounce quality pie."
1966.18,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8848.689,8849.207,"Quality, not the 22 --"
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8849.207,8852.495,Made -- made to the specifications of the Safeway.
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8853.364,8858.265,This was who -- the Swiss Miss was a smaller pie than Utah?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8858.265,8859.482,"Yes -- yes, Your Honor."
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8871.707,8875.588,And it was priced below Utah but you say that when you --
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8875.588,8876.217,When you factor those out --
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8876.217,8878.061,-- try to factor it out and that brings you --
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8878.061,8879.735,-- it goes up here.
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8879.735,8880.698,Close to Utah.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8880.698,8885.192,It's just like saying whether or not you know the difference between a Cadillac and a Chevrolet.
1966.18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8885.192,8895.598,But you wouldn't suggest that the rule of law that there could never be a rel -- Section 2 (a) case made out unless the defendant has met or beat the --
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8895.598,8897.381,I think -- I think you have to.
1966.18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8901.545,8906.705,"Well, I agree to that but that doesn't mean that you have to prove that you either met or beat his price."
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8906.705,8908.613,"Well, I think that's an important factor, Your Honor."
1966.18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8908.613,8911.855,I -- I understand that but -- but you don't say that that's always true.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8911.855,8913.188,Not -- not always true.
1966.18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8913.188,8916.493,Is there -- do you know of any cases that say that this is a rule of law of anything?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8916.493,8917.604,"No, I don't Your Honor."
1966.18,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8917.604,8919.516,And so it depends on the facts that are regained.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8919.516,8921.696,"That's right, Your Honor."
1966.18,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8976.195,8978.717,Was that a fact -- was that a fact for the jury to determine though?
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8978.717,8980.915,"That was the fact for the jury to determine, yes Your Honor."
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8983.363,8983.776,I guess --
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,8983.776,8984.965,-- in answer to one of the questions --
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8984.965,9008.205,I guess its real significance is that it shows an awareness as a competitor of this particular plaintiff as bearing upon the whether the effect or whatever happened here a) was directive and b) had a direct impact upon the plaintiff here.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,9008.205,9019.697,I think that such as in the -- in the General Electric case there is some discussion of this type of -- of strong competition and I think Your Honor that this is certainly wasn't an unfortunate incident.
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9029.133,9046.857,"I understand, I understand but I -- its problem takes a lot of dif -- may take a little different aspect when you look at it in terms of judicial dynamics and the question is this was something that might not impress the jury."
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,9046.857,9047.656,"Yes Your Honor, I -- I think --"
1966.18,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9047.656,9049.653,As to know sitting up here.
1966.18,3,25616,george_p_lamb,,9049.653,9053.748,"I -- I think that -- I think that is true, that it could have impressed the jury."
