2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,36.673,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-6539, Jay Shawn Johnson v. California."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,12.273,14.525,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,31.753,45.762,"Well now, Mr. Bedrick, are... are you talking about enough evidence, say, to... for a trial judge to let a case go to a jury or enough evidence to persuade a trial judge who's sitting as the finder of fact?"
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,47.678,50.314,"I would say the former rather than the latter, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,58.32,64.122,So it... it doesn't have to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,64.122,64.69,Absolutely not.
2003.03-6539,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,81.4,83.351,What's the best analog that you have?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,97.611,98.278,That's a good question.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.99,117.906,"Well, that's... that's not the standard for letting a case go to the jury, though."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,137.717,137.95,--No.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.95,146.288,--he has to say a reasonable juror could find that it is more likely than not that the plaintiff's case is... is sustainable.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,147.84,153.827,"When the test goes to the jury, the plaintiff has the burden of proving his case by a preponderance of the evidence."
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.827,155.845,The jury has to find it by a preponderance.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,155.845,156.211,Yes.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.211,168.403,"But in order to let it go to the jury, I had always thought that the criterion was not whether the judge thought it was more likely than not but whether in his view a reasonable jury could think it more likely than not."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,168.403,170.771,"I think that is close to the test that I'm asking for, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.771,171.621,Okay.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,183.096,184.063,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.887,195.037,You're asking more than that.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,203.076,204.359,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.359,204.692,You're not?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,204.692,205.176,I respectfully disagree.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.244,212.682,The... the prosecutor can stand silent and... and... and the... the judge can still find against you.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,212.682,229.125,"--Very much so because the... the series of cases from this Court, the Batson-Hernandez-Elem trilogy, and... and also the... some of the Title VII cases provide that even though the burden of producing evidence shifts, the burden of persuasion never shifts."
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.377,238.082,But the persuasion burden would be for the jury if you submit enough to make out a prima facie case.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,265.214,268.5,"--No, Your Honor, I do not win either under Batson or under Title VII."
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.593,284.978,"Yes, of course, but suppose the employer gives no reason."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,284.978,285.578,--I don't--
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.578,288.096,Suppose that the prosecutor stands silent.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,299.221,303.339,"--In the Batson context, Your Honor, we have never come across a case... there may be one."
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,308.493,319.266,"--Well, you... you were asked to consider what... what does it mean, this prima facie case, if the defendant does stand silent."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,326.288,345.583,"Yes, but even so, even... even in this theoretical and I think inconceivable hypothetical situation, if the challenger stood silent, the trial judge still has to determine whether or not the objector has proven discrimination at that point, at stage three, by a preponderance of the evidence."
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.583,355.038,"I... I suggest that the reason you've never come across a case in which the prosecutor stands silent is because the prosecutors know that if they stand silent, they lose."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,355.038,355.371,No.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.721,357.173,It's not at all inconceivable.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,372.917,376.637,--The prosecutor knows that he will look bad if he does not come up with a reason.
2003.03-6539,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.74,411.942,May I ask you a hypothetical question?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,434.221,444.829,"--With one juror challenged, six remain, from the defense perspective, I would say I have a very lousy... lousy chance of making a prima facie case, and I would not make that argument."
2003.03-6539,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,444.829,448.448,What if there were one and otherwise it was an all-white jury?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,448.448,453.602,Then I guess we would hope to find some evidence of the prosecutor's reason.
2003.03-6539,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,454.185,462.558,"I'm... I'm positing a case in which for reasons beyond the control of the prosecutor, they can't tell what the real reason was of the man who conducted the voir dire."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,462.558,474.265,"--At that point I would suggest that the wise trial judge would find a prima facie case, avoid any possible discrimination and ask jury selection to begin anew."
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.34,490.457,What if it comes up... comes up on appeal?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,494.744,495.577,I... I need some more facts.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.577,496.01,No.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,499.545,500.012,Yes.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.312,505.282,--on the basis of a... a strike that the appellate court has no way of finding out the reason for.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,505.282,505.632,--If--
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.632,508.651,The only prospective black juror was struck.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,508.651,529.481,"--That is why we are arguing here for this... for the threshold that we are arguing for, which is a relatively... relatively low threshold at which the trial judge examines all the circumstances and, when in doubt, rules that there should be a prima facie case, and then we get an answer, and then the trial judge makes a decision based on an answer, and then we get a record."
2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.481,531.699,Why do you say when in doubt?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,542.805,552.93,"Because in response to the last question, I was trying to show that one of the things that are missing when a... when the questions are not asked of the challenger is a record."
2003.03-6539,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,582.865,583.599,Tell me how it works.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,608.13,612.218,I would say it depends on the discretion of the objecting party.
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,624.409,625.026,What happened here?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,627.394,632.696,--The first motion here was made after the second African American juror and the second--
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.696,633.632,And then renewed on the third.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,633.632,637.434,--and the second motion was made after the third African American juror.
2003.03-6539,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.907,652.359,"And under your procedure, how long would this take?"
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,666.769,667.136,Yes.
2003.03-6539,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,667.903,669.821,Don't... don't they just go up to the bench?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,671.423,673.29,--I've seen it done all different ways.
2003.03-6539,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,682.478,683.48,What happened here?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,683.48,690.301,"Here both motions were discussed outside of the presence of the jury, and that was, of course--"
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,690.301,692.253,And the trial judge did what?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,697.455,711.465,"--The trial judge in this case on the first motion, decided that there was no prima facie case because the trial judge speculated as to possible reasons on the record that might theoretically and arguably have provided a race-neutral reason."
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,711.465,718.202,And was the judge asked if the prosecutor could be asked to explain?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,718.202,724.974,"The trial judge asked the prosecutor, Mr. Prosecutor, I'm about to... I'm in the... I'm about to rule that there's no prima facie case."
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,730.609,731.159,"Well, why should he--"
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,734.413,746.804,"--That was clearly too late in the process, but there are many other cases I mentioned earlier where when a prima facie case seems relatively close, the intelligent prosecutor will give a reason and make his record and protect his record."
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,746.804,747.121,Counsel--
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,762.464,764.447,There are other issues--
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,764.447,766.416,There are other issues in the case.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,766.416,766.916,--Yes.
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,766.916,772.152,"The Brady claim, some evidentiary... and... and a new trial was granted on some of those issues?"
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,772.152,772.436,No.
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,795.602,798.07,"On the third trial, were there other issues?"
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,798.07,801.439,There are other issues that the court of appeal did not reach.
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,801.439,803.208,That were not reached.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,803.208,803.674,Yes.
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,803.674,807.16,But do we have a jurisdictional problem?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,808.576,813.829,We certainly have a... we certainly have a final judgment from a trial which is a conviction of the defendant.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.971,825.871,"Well, but it's sent back."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,831.875,834.643,The... yes.
2003.03-6539,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,834.643,835.06,Well--
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,839.214,841.583,"That is theoretically possible, but I think--"
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,841.583,843.049,But that's on three of those issues.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,856.342,860.46,"--Yes, that's correct, Your Honor, but I very much hope that the Court would reach the issues here."
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,861.577,863.412,But we have a firm finality rule.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,870.566,871.268,I believe that--
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.268,872.768,We've put in a lot of time on it too.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,872.768,873.168,--I understand.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.137,877.256,I... I--
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,877.256,884.576,We have a... California has... differs from every other court in the Nation on several of these jury selection points.
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.897,898.752,"--We understand that it's a good case to address the issue, but only if there's a final judgment so that we have jurisdiction."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,902.554,905.489,This issue has not been raised by either side in this case.
2003.03-6539,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,905.489,906.525,"Well, it's raised now."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,906.525,907.625,"I understand that, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,924.318,929.455,But now it does because it's been reversed and there's a remand.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,938.06,940.096,"If it needs to reach those, that's correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,940.096,941.212,"Well, it's been instructed."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,976.749,977.601,"It very much is, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,977.601,980.137,There's nothing more to be decided relevant to that issue.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,980.137,982.52,Absolutely not.
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.43,997.613,May I ask you one question that is relevant to that?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1037.974,1045.496,--Because California did not present any federalism issues at the State supreme court nor does my opponent.
2003.03-6539,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.936,1059.922,I thought part of that was that Batson leaves room for the States.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1069.195,1080.753,"There are... there... there are some... I'm not sure what aspects were left to the States, but California's Supreme Court did not... the State makes this argument, but the California Supreme Court did not."
2003.03-6539,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1086.038,1088.657,More a question for the State than for you.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1117.176,1127.282,"The best standard we could come up with, Your Honor, was something that was similar to the standard on a Federal civil procedure 12(b)(6) motion."
2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1137.689,1141.574,"Yes, but what you're talking about is a judgment at the close of the plaintiff's case, aren't you?"
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1145.509,1148.711,"That... that's what 12(b)(6) would be, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1180.949,1192.24,"But you... you do have some difference on a motion to dismiss because the rule is that if any conceivable allegations could have been proved in support of what the complaint says, it shouldn't be dismissed."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1199.41,1203.528,I... I guess I'm persuaded that we are somewhat higher than rule 12(b)(6).
2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.699,1245.355,"But the typical discovery motion isn't appealable, so there isn't much writing on the subject of what sort of a standard should apply in that sort of discovery."
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1245.355,1247.221,--But it... it could turn out to be appealable.
2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.05,1305.476,What if... what if the trial court at the prima facie stage says it... it seems perfectly obvious to me... and I think this is perhaps what the judge here did... that the reason the prosecutor did this was thus and so.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1314.047,1325.771,"I can't see anything remotely obvious here, Your Honor, between the State judges and the attorney... State Attorney General's office has speculated as to two reasons for challenges to Clodette Turner."
2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1333.727,1334.144,"Well, what... what--"
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1334.144,1336.663,"If it was so obvious, they wouldn't have 15 speculations."

2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1351.839,1361.878,"The prosecutor is, and then the defense gets to argue, as one does in a Title VII case, that there is something wrong with that answer which therefore shows prejudice."

2003.03-6539,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.124,1463.06,I thought you didn't need a reason for a peremptory challenge.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1465.262,1465.928,A peremptory challenge--
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.928,1466.745,I don't know.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1474.534,1474.984,--A peremptory--
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.984,1475.751,Is... is that enough of a reason?
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1475.751,1480.355,--A peremptory challenge is valid for any reason except an unconstitutional reason.
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1480.355,1480.622,Right.
2003.03-6539,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1480.622,1489.56,"When this Court considered Batson, the argument made by the State is we have a peremptory challenge statute which is very important and you shouldn't just brush it aside."
2003.03-6539,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.317,1526.567,So what I said wouldn't suffice.

2003.03-6539,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.344,1645.011,Okay.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1647.163,1648.313,That's as best as I can do.

2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1653.4,1654.233,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1654.233,1656.435,And that will be law on the case.

2003.03-6539,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1715.888,1717.389,And why shouldn't it be the latter?
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1717.389,1730.864,"Because the judge is operating as the fact finder in this setting, and given the nature of the prima facie case requirement, which is one that when the prima facie case is met, entitles the objecting party to prevail--"

2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1822.624,1823.574,"Essentially, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1823.574,1823.974,Yes.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1823.974,1825.826,In the... in the Batson context.
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1830.897,1831.28,Okay.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1844.004,1844.488,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1851.492,1862.549,"And... and when he does that, he may very well, in effect, say, yes, there's evidence here from which I could infer discriminatory intent, but I don't infer it."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1868.802,1870.419,"In a stage three, Your Honor, of a Batson proceeding?"
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1870.419,1870.652,Yes.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1870.652,1871.002,Yes.

2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1882.544,1883.396,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.017,1902.707,"But... but if no reasons are given, it's your position that automatically it's determined that there's a constitutional violation."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1902.707,1903.39,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.923,1905.575,The other side says no.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1905.575,1920.735,"--Well, that ignores the disposition in Batson itself in which the Court explained that on remand it was up to the trial court to determine whether there was a prima facie case, and if the prosecutor did not come forward with his race-neutral reasons, the judgment had to be reversed."
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1921.169,1937.863,"But isn't the... the position that... that you are advocating, if I understand it correctly, is that the court saves the prosecutor that burden by the court, before turning to the prosecutor, to say what's your nondiscriminatory reason."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1952.956,1962.062,"--Not entirely, Your Honor, in that it is not the court's obligation nor do California courts seek out to save the striking party."
2003.03-6539,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1973.286,1986.713,"Well, do you think... suppose there were 12 peremptory challenges and there were 12 African American prospective jurors there and all of them were stricken."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1992.7,1998.687,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, certainly numerosity is an important point or an important consideration."
2003.03-6539,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1998.687,1999.937,--in my example.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1999.937,2002.972,"Your... Your Honor, your example actually needs additional facts."
2003.03-6539,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.331,2023.969,"Well, so, the trial judge can look into that as a part of the prima facie case."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2026.92,2032.741,"Yes, Your Honor, because of the... it is the trial judge's obligation under Batson to evaluate all the facts and circumstances."
2003.03-6539,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2041.097,2050.719,"Suppose I'm the trial judge and I consider, you know, there are reasons why the prosecutor... legitimate reasons why the prosecutor might have exercised this challenge."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2057.023,2063.26,--I think it's up to the trial... trial judge to determine whether the objector has met his burden of persuasion as more likely than not.
2003.03-6539,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.962,2068.164,"Well, I... the... the case is the one I... I gave you."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2091.114,2099.635,"--And I think it's important, Your Honor, to distinguish the rule as understood on appeal in California from the rule in application in the trial courts."
2003.03-6539,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2114.062,2118.681,But it's very odd that he would do that without even asking the prosecutor to comment.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2118.681,2120.299,"--Not... not particularly, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2121.666,2125.001,"I mean, it's odd in the sense that California is one of the only States that does it."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2125.001,2134.893,"--Well, Your Honor, if the prosecutor three African American prospective jurors, all of whom are defense attorneys and they're struck by the prosecutor, there's nothing odd about not asking about that."
2003.03-6539,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.601,2185.741,"Well... no, I didn't mean to... complete your... the... the problem I have with... with, I guess, that argument and... and with the California position is this."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2248.649,2253.72,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that is the purpose of the... of the prima facie case requirement."
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2262.258,2269.912,But it puts the prosecutor in a... in rather a difficult spot if... if you get to that point.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2269.912,2270.347,"Yes, and that--"
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2270.347,2276.168,Because the prosecutor has already been told you lose unless you've got a darned good reason.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2276.168,2283.655,--Just as the employer is told that essentially in a Title VII case when the evidence is introduced on those four McDonnell Douglas factors and the evidence is persuasive.
2003.03-6539,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.655,2284.172,But... but it seems to me--
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2292.011,2292.561,"Well, then there's--"
2003.03-6539,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.561,2292.961,No.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2296.546,2297.331,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.331,2299.014,He doesn't say you're going to win.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2311.774,2328.851,"In the... in the Batson setting, in the Title VII cases, in any case in which there is a prima facie case found, going back to Kelly v. Peters with Justice Story, there is such evidence that unless rebutted, the party with the burden of persuasion will prevail."
2003.03-6539,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.851,2331.653,That is true if you've got a presumption working.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2364.975,2370.61,"Certainly it does operate when there is a presumption established by the court, as this Court did in McDonnell Douglas."
2003.03-6539,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2379.651,2383.019,May I ask you this question just to be sure I... I have your position?
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2395.744,2399.129,--We are... there are... there are other cases that announced the same standard.
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.185,2410.587,The legislature overturned it in Connecticut.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2411.221,2417.508,My belief is that actually the Supreme Court of Connecticut under its supervisory authority established a sort of--
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2417.508,2420.459,"Anyway, it's no... Connecticut is not out of line anymore."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2420.459,2421.394,--Not... yes.
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2452.664,2456.402,But in Title VII there would be a presumption if the employer said nothing.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2481.367,2482.517,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2505.698,2516.023,"But I thought that... that this Title VII, the idea of reasonable inference plus presumption... that that's supposed to be the formula for Batson as well."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2516.023,2520.975,--Not presumption in the sense that there are four elements of McDonnell Douglas that apply in a Batson context.
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2556.231,2573.757,"I thought he said that the presumption operates in the run... mine run of cases, it's the presumption that the... what you call the strong evidence test... that's Batson for special instances and it isn't the dominant rule."

2003.03-6539,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.69,2714.849,"--Of course, the irony of that is that if... if you had an ordinary civil lawsuit and the plaintiff files a complaint on information and belief... I have good faith and belief such and such happened... then he takes a deposition and asks the defendant did it happen."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2720.235,2727.324,"--That's... that's the nature of privilege of peremptory challenges, the nature of any other privilege that protects information."
2003.03-6539,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.251,2751.272,"Is it appropriate in a case like this to weigh, on the one hand, the importance of the interests that are protected by the Batson rule and, the other hand, the burden on the prosecutor by having to answer the question?"
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2755.491,2756.01,"No, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2799.281,2810.506,"Of course, there are those... I remember Justice Marshall used to take the position that it would be better for the system as a whole if we entirely abandoned peremptories because you... you're better off if you always know what the reason is."
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2812.458,2813.791,"Yes, that was his view, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2827.715,2838.506,But they... most... most jurisdictions... most courts that considered this issue have the reasonable inference and that gives rise to the presumption.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2849.028,2853.115,"--Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure that the numbers are that stark, given that most cases--"
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2853.115,2853.515,Whatever.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2854.548,2855.648,--There's certainly a divergence.
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2855.648,2862.288,"Now, are you saying there is only one right way and that's California's, or are you saying it's up to the States?"
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2864.74,2873.596,"Your Honor, I think that certainly the footnote in Batson in the final part of the discussion recognizes the... that it is left to the States to determine procedures to govern Batson."
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2875.346,2885.82,"Does that mean... procedures to govern... that one State can have reasonable inference gives rise to presumption and in another, as California, can have strong likelihood?"
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2885.82,2894.342,"--Quite possibly, Your Honor, in that we believe more likely than not is... is the result from Batson given the Title VII description."
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2917.875,2937.586,"Because you... you said something about one of the reasons you're resisting this is it may... it prolongs the trial and you have to clear the jury and the... in the... the places that have reasonable inference plus presumption, has there been this slowing down, the clogging of the court?"
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2942.24,2949.66,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of anyone having conducted a time in motion study of... of voir dire in the various States to find out how they're proceeding."
2003.03-6539,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2974.045,2977.829,I... I did... the question I asked you was just a purely practical one.
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2999.41,3007.016,"I think it's unknowable, Your Honor, that the... the extent to which the system is burdened is not something that can be readily determined."
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3015.455,3018.24,"Well, how does California handle a challenge for cause?"
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3029.779,3031.798,"Frequently it's done at the... at the bench, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3031.798,3035.766,"Well, this... couldn't the same thing be done on... on a Batson challenge?"
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3035.766,3036.868,It's not typically done that way.
2003.03-6539,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3037.635,3038.518,"Well, why couldn't it be?"
2003.03-6539,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3038.518,3050.878,"--The... the first step perhaps could be, but at some point there's going to need to be most likely further proceedings or to then go back and determine whether those reasons are pretextual."
2003.03-6539,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3113.968,3116.654,"Thank you, Mr. Bedrick... or rather, Mr. Schalit."
2003.03-6539,2,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,3119.706,3120.989,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.03-6539,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3209.547,3210.366,"Yes, you would."
2003.03-6539,2,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,3235.081,3238.033,"--If... if that was a guaranteed invitation, Your Honor, I would accept it."
2003.03-6539,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.801,3244.17,We will... we will already have done the work.
2003.03-6539,2,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,3247.322,3248.189,--Yes.
2003.03-6539,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.189,3252.776,"Well, and importantly, we know what the California Supreme Court's final word is on it already."
2003.03-6539,2,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,3252.776,3253.259,We don't know.
2003.03-6539,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.808,3307.862,But maybe they can get it from the Ninth Circuit.
2003.03-6539,2,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,3307.862,3310.897,--That is possibly true.
2003.03-6539,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3310.897,3311.981,It's definitely true.
2003.03-6539,2,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,3314.683,3323.389,"Yes, and we have this continuing battle where counsel is required to spend and waste enormous amounts of time going back and forth and back and forth."
2003.03-6539,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3357.443,3358.478,"Thank you, Mr. Bedrick."
