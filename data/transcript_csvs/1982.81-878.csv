1982.81-878,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.667,We will hear arguments next in Larkin v. Grendel's Den.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,59.098,60.271,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.025,164.556,Mr. Caruso.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,164.556,165.355,--Yes.
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.355,170.787,Could I ask you a question about the procedure followed by the Court of Appeals before you get anymore deeply into the merits?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,170.787,171.255,Sure.
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.255,181.285,"As I understand it, the Plaintiffs, the Respondents here, asserted a couple of constitutional claims and a statutory antitrust claim in the district court, did they not?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,181.285,182.361,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,182.361,185.157,And then all of those went up on appeal to the First Circuit?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,185.157,186.111,Yes.
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.51,239.309,And all of those--
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,239.309,241.43,All of that went up to the First Circuit.
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.43,261.626,"--Well, in view of all of our talking in our opinions about how at least this Court, and I think we've said other federal courts too, should first address statutory claims before they reach constitutional claims, isn't it a little odd that the First Circuit addressed constitutional claims and didn't resolve the statutory claim?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,261.626,285.632,"Well, insofar as the statutory claim was the supremacy clause claim under the antitrust laws, Your Honor, I think the First Circuit... I don't know why the First Circuit chose to proceed the way it did on the en banc review."
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.995,323.882,"But the antitrust claim is still a live one as between these two parties, I take it?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,323.882,324.883,Yes.
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.237,340.299,But it wasn't as if the antitrust claim hadn't been appealed to the First Circuit.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,345.5,346.701,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.498,349.092,Not to dispose of it.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,349.092,354.481,"--I should also add, Your Honor, that the original panel of the First Circuit did address that claim."
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.99,377.016,The First Circuit said first of all that you weren't entitled to summary judgment on your antitrust claim.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,377.016,381.377,"That's what the court said in essence, yes."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,381.377,383.155,"Mr. Caruso, I'm just curious."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,390.528,391.339,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,391.339,392.431,How'd that happen?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,392.431,398.569,"Well, the First Circuit, as you know, Your Honor, consists of four judges."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,407.113,408.817,"Oh, I see, sitting by designation."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,408.817,409.503,Right.
1982.81-878,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,447.395,454.001,"Had the case remained on the statutory basis, would we be here now on this case?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,454.001,455.436,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1982.81-878,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,455.436,459.153,Had the case been resolved on the statutory grounds?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,459.153,487.674,"Well, I think insofar as Grendel's was challenging our statute under the antitrust laws and essentially claiming that the federal court should strike down the statute because it violated the antitrust laws, I frankly, after this Court's decision in Rice v. Norman Williams, don't think that Grendel's claim is going to prevail there."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,487.674,491.124,But in any even it's another constitutional issue.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,491.124,500.418,It is another constitutional issue and it is somewhere in this proceeding that we engage in.
1982.81-878,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,566.783,577.311,Does it not delegate to a religious institution a power that is perhaps thought to be a governmental power?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,577.311,579.23,"No, it doesn't, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,596.161,607.829,"Suppose the statute said that all liquor licenses in Massachusetts shall be controlled by a board consisting of the leader of the Catholic Church, the Protestant churches."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,609.639,611.342,"I would not buy that, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,611.342,615.184,May I ask you the difference between that one and this one?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,615.184,622.868,"Well, Your Honor, here this statute represents the legislature's judgment of the public interest."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,622.868,625.54,"So did the first one, I assumed."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,625.54,626.476,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,628.616,633.035,"Well, my hypothetical is the state legislature passed it--"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,633.035,652.186,"--The state legislature has given to churches in that case, or private persons for that matter, anyone, the power to decide and not decide whether or not a liquor license should issue."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,655.559,656.873,--Like what?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,656.873,667.038,Here the statute reads that no premises shall be licensed if the governing body of the church objects.
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,691.871,708.35,"Well, assuming I understand why a church would not want a bar and grill in its neighborhood, how do I understand that a church wants a bar and grill next door?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,723.048,743.29,"--Well, Your Honor, if I understand your question correctly, and I may not, I think if you look at the statute in the context of its historical development, you get a better flavor for what the legislature is promoting here."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,824.973,829.644,How can you call it a zone of tranquility with 14 licensees in the zone?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,829.644,834.987,"Your Honor, there's approximately 26 licensees in this zone."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.987,837.876,How can you call it a zone of tranquility?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,837.876,842.044,"Well, Your Honor, the purpose of the statute was twofold."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.402,855.151,"And as soon as one is established, why, that purpose has been frustrated."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,855.151,859.023,"--Well, yes, Your Honor, only in this extent."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.687,881.827,"Well, then there's been a change in legislative policy."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,881.827,883.387,--Only to the extent--
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.387,886.433,You earlier seemed to be arguing that the three statutes were functionally equivalent.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,887.778,891.323,"--I think they are functionally equivalent, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.323,896.431,"Well, hasn't there been a change in policy from one that said you can't have any to one that says you can have 26?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,896.431,904.976,"Your Honor, only to the extent that the legislature now does not now--"
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.976,908.097,"The legislature says, we don't care, but if the church cares it can't open."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,908.097,910.863,"--No, I disagree with you, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.172,919.579,The same as when it prohibited them entirely?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,922.561,942.8,"--Well, the legislature I think now believes that if a church does not have... a church may not object to one, to a liquor license, especially in a congested area like Harvard Square, that's around the corner and up the street."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.8,944.005,"Well, I understand."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,952.845,958.609,I think if the legislature had that policy it would have.
1982.81-878,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,996.921,1013.709,"Mr. Attorney General, may a church exercise what you characterize as a waiver on a selective basis, so that it would allow a liquor store in one building and deny it in an adjacent building?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1013.709,1016.583,That is--
1982.81-878,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1016.583,1018.302,That's permissible under the statute?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1018.302,1020.475,"--That is possible, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1020.475,1026.956,"And that could be done arbitrarily, with no reason, no standard prescribed by the legislature."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1034.797,1043.15,"We would argue, Your Honor... and this was why we asked that the district court abstain in this case."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.816,1103.69,What happens if the church only has bars that sell Irish whisky?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1103.69,1107.844,If the church?
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1107.844,1112.685,Only allows bars in its neighborhood that sell Irish whisky.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1112.685,1116.979,I would rely back on my--
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1116.979,1119.027,"Well, I'm going from there to tequila."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1119.027,1119.729,--Sure.
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1119.729,1121.744,"So I mean, I can go anywhere I want to go."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1121.744,1125.835,"I would fall back on my position, Your Honor, that that case--"
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1125.835,1132.866,"Why should I, as a legitimate businessman, have to go and ask a church whether I can do business?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1132.866,1146.078,"--The option, Your Honor, was that you couldn't do business in that zone of protection at all because there was a legislative prohibition."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1146.078,1148.25,But that's not today.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1152.34,1156.481,What the legislature has done--
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1156.481,1157.839,"Now, don't leave out any of my points."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1164.885,1167.053,"--No, you don't, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1172.161,1173.503,Yes.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1173.503,1179.219,--The legislature has decided that that is not a suitable site.
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.219,1180.207,"Oh, no."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1185.346,1187.28,"I disagree, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1187.28,1188.937,"Well, what did the state say?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1188.937,1211.928,I think the legislature has determined that in proximity of a church or a school is not a suitable site for liquor establishments unless there's no good reason why the liquor establishment shouldn't be developed there.
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1215.613,1218.269,I'm talking about what the statute says.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1237.275,1243.194,"You can apply for a liquor license, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1243.194,1247.695,Will I get it without the permission of the church?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1247.695,1250.569,"If the church objects, you would not get it."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1252.488,1253.411,Then don't I have to get the permission of the church?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1253.411,1254.378,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1254.378,1263.875,"How do you distinguish that from giving the church, whatever church is picked out, the power to issue the license?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1266.48,1284.707,"Well, Your Honor, once the site is established as being suitable, then the state remains the official determining body as to whether or not the liquor license would issue."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1307.495,1311.73,And is that true of all 26 other licensed establishments in this zone?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1318.788,1320.087,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1325.643,1326.941,In 1954?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1326.941,1328.345,In 1954.
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1344.419,1345.667,1968?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1345.667,1346.556,Yes.
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1346.556,1347.917,"To which the church might have, but did not, object?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1347.917,1349.212,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.212,1360.739,Do you think the Court of Appeals en banc held that a flat ban within 500 feet of any liquor establishments would be unconstitutional also?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1360.739,1361.523,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.959,1367.36,Which would make the consent issue irrelevant?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1367.36,1368.815,"--Right, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.815,1384.183,"Isn't the consent issue made pretty much irrelevant by cases like New Motor Vehicle Board of California v. Orrin Fox, where the Court says that almost any system of private or quasi-private law could be subject to the same objection?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1392.743,1393.928,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.693,1416.28,"The opinion below also seems to me to read that even if a flat ban would be sustainable, this conditional... or this consent, the consent provision, renders it unconstitutional."
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1419.418,1423.404,"--It's very difficult to say what the en banc panel was doing, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.973,1442.13,Which has nothing to do with getting a consent.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1442.13,1443.518,"Right, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1448.345,1455.231,"Incidentally, Mr. Caruso, don't many state statutes like this take the form of a flat ban?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1455.231,1456.265,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1456.265,1460.48,And did you just suggest to my brother White that they'd be unconstitutional?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1460.48,1463.199,"Under the en banc panel decision, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.199,1464.933,That's what I was asking.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1467.652,1468.947,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1475.615,1477.927,Have they been tested in any states?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1477.927,1490.436,"Well, in many states... every single court decision that we have found has upheld this type of statute."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1490.436,1492.343,Including all the flat bans?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1492.343,1496.699,Including the flat bans and the consent provisions.
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1496.699,1497.092,State.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1497.092,1498.933,State courts.
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.68,1512.165,It wouldn't be New Orleans?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1512.165,1513.569,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1513.569,1516.458,Because they don't have any closing law down there.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1521.988,1528.92,"Your Honor, I've never been to New Orleans, so I defer to your knowledge on that."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1532.06,1541.056,Do you know whether the attacks on the flat ban statutes have been on establishment clause grounds?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1541.056,1545.428,"Yes, they have, Your Honor, consistently on establishment clause grounds."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1642.963,1650.024,"Mr. Caruso, you don't make any argument that the Twenty-First Amendment supports you on the establishment clause?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1650.024,1651.35,"We do, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1665.533,1673.967,But you don't argue that the Twenty-First Amendment makes this constitutional irrespective of the establishment clause?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1673.967,1674.56,--No.
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.942,1692.1,May I ask you one question.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1697.38,1697.895,Yes.
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.895,1707.53,Are some of those cases... do they sustain a consent mechanism where there have been some offensive uses within the area and then they have been permitted to object to an additional offensive use?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1707.53,1712.093,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.635,1721.073,"It was stipulated, wasn't it?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1721.073,1723.211,It was stipulated as a facial challenge.
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.211,1727.694,Wasn't it also stipulated there are a lot of other taverns in the area?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1727.694,1730.054,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.054,1732.238,So we do know what the facts are.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1732.238,1739.55,"We do know what the facts are, only to the extent that there are other liquor establishments in the area."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.625,1751.076,But under the decision the consent mechanism is invalidated statewide in all situations.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1751.076,1752.074,"--Right, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.4,1754.184,That's the facial challenge.
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1754.184,1755.759,That's the facial challenge.
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.009,1768.05,Do you think we need to be stuck with a stipulation about some facial challenge?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1768.05,1770.301,"Well, I think so, Your Honor, because--"
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.301,1771.097,Why?
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1775.893,1790.636,"--Well, Your Honor, if you want to remand it back and let us have a trial on the as applied claims Grendel's makes, the Commonwealth may be willing to do that."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.54,1807.724,"Why should the district court be forced to make a facial... to answer a facial challenge just by a stipulation, if it would be a much narrower decision if decided as applied?"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1807.724,1811.862,"--We asked the district court to abstain, Your Honor, from the as applied."
1982.81-878,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.862,1814.627,"Well, but you stipulated that it was a facial--"
1982.81-878,0,25096,gerald_j_caruso,,1814.627,1831.339,"Following the motion to... the denial of our motion to dismiss, we viewed it as we had no opportunity to get those as applied claims back into the state court, to see."
1982.81-878,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.92,1867.916,Mr. Tribe.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1867.916,1871.711,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1916.945,1926.893,"Do you think that's a permissible posture under our cases, to say that we have a statutory claim here but we're not going to press it right now, we're going to press our constitutional claim?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1926.893,1932.408,"Justice Rehnquist, I think it would be problematic if they were at the same level, if they were both facial claims."
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.486,1977.341,But do you find any authority in our cases for saying that in those circumstances you take the constitutional claim before you take the statutory claim?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1977.341,1982.154,"Well, as Justice White pointed out, there's a constitutional supremacy clause claim in any event."
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.664,1993.368,That's still a supremacy clause.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1993.368,1993.945,That's right.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.13,2004.049,It used to make a difference... there used to be a difference in old three-judge court practice.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2004.049,2004.817,"--That's right, under the Kessler."
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.817,2006.065,But not here.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2006.065,2010.456,And it seems to me that's clear here for the additional reason that--
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.456,2014.656,"Well, but if the Sherman Act applies there isn't any constitutional issue remaining."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2021.215,2021.48,--Yes.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.664,2033.022,But the doctrine of avoiding constitutional issues would be served by addressing the Sherman Act claim first.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2033.022,2038.068,"--The Sherman Act claim here would not avoid the fundamental issue, which would still be before the Court."
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.068,2040.895,If you won on the Sherman Act claim we would avoid the constitutional issue.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2040.895,2043.691,"Well, Your Honor, let me suggest why that's not quite true."
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.86,2091.359,"Well, did you allege a conspiracy between the church and the other licensees?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2091.359,2093.013,--There is an allegation in this case.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.29,2112.537,"Well, let me hold you up, because I'm not really familiar with the details of the allegation."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2122.922,2124.377,--It alleges--
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.377,2127.5,"--And if it is so alleged, why shouldn't that case be tried?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2127.5,2134.059,"--Because in order to prove that, Your Honor, we would anticipate the other side would argue that the kind of evidence we would need is constitutionally--"
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.059,2136.195,You must have that evidence if you made that allegation.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2136.195,2137.4,--We have reason to believe it.
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.121,2171.697,Only that's administrative assessment.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2173.292,2188.004,"Well, but as this Court has held in cases such as Serbian Orthodox and others, either judicial or administrative assessment of the internal motives and workings of a religious body's decisionmaking process raises grave First Amendment problems."
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2188.004,2190.831,Don't you need more than belief?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2190.831,2194.376,But we're not asking this Court to act on the basis of--
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.376,2195.535,You said all you have is belief.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2196.845,2197.921,--To file the original complaint.
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.216,2209.932,But do you have a right to assert something on belief?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2209.932,2214.416,"--On information and belief, yes, of course, Your Honor, and it was asserted on that basis."
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2221.006,2222.273,Information which you have?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2222.273,2224.629,--On the basis of what was known when the complaint was filed.
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.816,2230.158,"Well, it's a distraction largely because you've made it one, I think."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2242.75,2263.082,"Your Honor, it seems to me that the same argument exactly could have been made in Eubank, where this Court facially invalidated an ordinance giving power to private parties to tell others what to do with their property, and instead, and instead the Court said that the illustrations of abuse are simply relevant to showing how facially void the law is."
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.987,2271.111,Was there a statutory claim in each of those cases?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2271.111,2271.735,--No.
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.967,2281.39,"But that was a choice between two constitutional grounds, at any rate."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2281.39,2283.356,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.356,2293.307,"To what extent, Mr. Tribe, do you think the opinion of the first panel is any factor in this case?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2296.539,2302.801,"No, I was only suggesting as a matter of understanding the evolution of the antitrust issue that one look at it."
1982.81-878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2303.706,2309.33,"As soon as an en banc was voted, that vacated the first opinion and it's a complete nullity, is it not?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2309.33,2311.47,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice Burger."
1982.81-878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.47,2312.874,"The First Circuit doesn't have any other practice, does it?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2312.874,2313.331,No.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.754,2351.893,"But the only antitrust issue I see stated in your amended complaint in this case was a preemption claim, that this statute was invalid--"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2351.893,2352.657,As applied.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.657,2353.827,--on its face and as applied--
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2353.827,2354.467,Correct.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.467,2359.529,--because its operation is preempted by the Sherman Act.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2359.529,2360.874,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.874,2361.669,That's what you say.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2361.669,2362.824,And that is what we believe.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.824,2363.826,Yes.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2367.12,2371.866,And therefore this Court's practice of avoiding constitutional issues would not suggest--
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.866,2373.602,"Mr. Tribe, that's not a fair reading of your complaint."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2402.653,2408.869,--I would say that the inquiry into why the church exercised its veto power is a--
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.869,2409.415,"No, no."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2418.567,2421.253,"--I don't say it's impossible, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.223,2429.361,"--You say there are greater constitutional issues at stake there than deciding the ultimate issue on the merits here, that's what you're saying."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2450.102,2453.881,"--We ask for a declaration of two kinds, Mr. Justice White."
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.079,2475.137,And hence the statute may not operate.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2475.137,2476.217,May not so operate.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.116,2494.974,"What's more, you do allege private agreements, as well as just the facial effect of the statute."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2494.974,2496.269,--We allege such agreements.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.269,2497.022,"Right, okay."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2497.022,2498.597,But if we--
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.597,2500.8,So you disagree with Justice White's last comment?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2500.8,2505.72,"--But it's... the private agreements are... let me explain, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.72,2509.218,"I'm referring to paragraph 12 of the complaint, as well as paragraph 20."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2509.218,2509.717,Correct.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.717,2512.607,20 refers back to the private agreements alleged in 12.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2512.607,2521.791,But those private agreements would have no effect on Grendel's Den in this case had they not led the church to exercise its veto power.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.791,2522.462,I understand.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2522.462,2525.351,And the only relief we sought was not damages against the private parties.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2584.639,2586.046,Why would it violate the establishment clause?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2600.229,2606.913,"Well, I suppose if we had to rest with their answer, without pursuing the matter further through depositions and interrogatories, there'd be no problem."
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.156,2638.979,"Well, suppose we... suppose we decided or suppose that you would even agree that there was no entanglement problem in adjudicating this case on an as-applied basis under the First Amendment."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2662.033,2668.123,"Well, there are two... I'm afraid that the only way I can answer that is to say that there are two levels of as-applied analysis here."
1982.81-878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2744.966,2756.587,"Putting aside your stipulations in this case, are you representing to the Court your view that there was no way to decide this case without reaching constitutional issues?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2757.898,2764.301,"I don't believe that this Court can decide that the judgment... well, let me see."
1982.81-878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2774.518,2783.827,"As someone else has suggested to you, the framing of the issues in the case doesn't control the Court on what issue should be decided."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2792.587,2801.272,"I think there is no way the court could have avoided it, however we framed the question, given the relief we sought, and surely the parties have the right to seek particular relief."
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.196,2871.115,"Mr. Tribe, I'm embarrassed that I haven't examined the Sherman Act claim more closely before."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2875.584,2876.629,That's correct.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.629,2878.349,That's a rather strange Sherman Act claim.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2878.349,2902.9,"Because our primary sense was not... the complaint here really was that Grendel's Den was subject to the absolute discretion of one neighbor, the church, and that that was fundamentally unfair, that it was threatening to put them out of business, and that it was subjecting them to the kind of power that the framers never imagined that churches or other private parties would exercise."
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.161,3046.687,"Mr. Tribe, I'm still worried about the original proposition of alleging that some dealers will pay off somebody and get permission."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3057.072,3060.917,"But happily, Justice Marshall, there are laws against bribery."
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3073.675,3075.644,It could be that you've never heard of anything like it before.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3075.644,3079.049,--Justice Brandeis feared that exactly this would happen.
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3079.049,3080.047,In 18-what?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3080.047,3081.201,In 1891.
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3081.201,3083.108,"Well, this is 1982."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3083.108,3084.765,But the problem is an enduring one.
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3131.841,3139.788,"I agree, but I don't see the necessity for saying the reason is because they'll take money illegally."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3139.788,3147.91,"Well, Justice Marshall, that is the necessity to which we would be placed if Justice Rehnquist's suggestion that there ought to be an antitrust trial--"
1982.81-878,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3147.91,3149.236,"Well, count me out of that."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3149.236,3154.298,"--That is not, Justice Marshall, by any means indispensable to our prevailing."
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.271,3183.942,Would you concede that a flat ban was constitutional?
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3183.942,3185.615,"Well, happily, this case doesn't pose the issue."
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3185.615,3187.034,That wasn't what I asked you.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3187.034,3191.347,"Well, if it were a very narrowly focused flat ban, it might pose problems."
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3249.181,3256.695,The reason you have a crazy-quilt in Harvard Square... we don't have any information about whether or not there are crazy-quilts in the other parts of Massachusetts.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3256.695,3257.303,--That's right.
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3260.053,3260.724,Or crazy at all.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3260.724,3262.162,--Or crazy at all.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.667,3304.16,"Mr. Tribe, do you think the Court of Appeals meant to invalidate this statute wholly aside from the consent issue, if there was just a flat ban unconnected to--"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3304.16,3306.317,"--I think, Justice White, the opinion is ambiguous."
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.985,3319.278,--I take it your argument in your brief and here is primarily on the consent.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3319.278,3320.308,That's right.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.7,3324.714,"Well, I agree."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3332.1,3340.317,"--No, because we think that, just as Justice Rehnquist would want to avoid the whole constitutional issue, certainly that more difficult constitutional issue should be avoided here."
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3359.84,3373.801,"Mr. Tribe, if you don't rely on the flat ban analogy, then your delegation argument, it seems to me, would be equally strong if the power to veto were given, say, to a bank or to the largest tavern in the neighborhood."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3373.801,3374.445,--That's right.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.219,3436.107,"I take it your argument, however, would invalidate the statute even if it gave... if it was a very general consent provision."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3436.107,3437.074,That's right.
1982.81-878,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3437.074,3442.354,"As long as a church was included, it would be invalid?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3442.354,3445.665,"Under the establishment clause, I think that's right, Justice White."
1982.81-878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3490.159,3493.938,"That thesis would avoid the establishment clause problem, wouldn't it?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3493.938,3509.809,"It would certainly avoid the establishment clause problem, and it would be a welcome opportunity for this Court to remind people that those decisions, although they may look old... Eubank v. Richmond, 1912; Washington ex rel. Seattle v. Roberge, 1928... represent good law."
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3509.809,3514.835,"They not only look old, but they've been scarcely ever cited since they've been decided."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3514.835,3518.805,"Well, this Court cited them with approval in 1976 in Eastlake."
1982.81-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3518.805,3519.492,Once.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3519.492,3520.412,That was once.
1982.81-878,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3582.745,3587.307,"Mr. Tribe, do you think this Court's opinion in Cusack was wrong?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3587.307,3590.01,"Well, I think it was one of the more difficult cases in the area."
1982.81-878,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3595.009,3606.252,"Well, is it distinguishable if we apply the interpretation of Section 16(c) given it by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3606.252,3619.467,"Well, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court interpreted the purposes of the waiver as... of the current veto, which they describe specifically in their opinion as a veto."
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3702.183,3709.928,"Well, but Mr. Tribe, would you suggest this statute could be cured by allowing the veto, but it be exercised by a vote among the 26 existing tavern owners?"
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3709.928,3710.758,It would no longer be a veto.
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3713.305,3715.929,"Well, the 26 tavern owners are the people allowed to vote in the referendum."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3715.929,3717.38,"--Well, it would be at least a different case."
1982.81-878,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3719.786,3720.332,I wouldn't think so.
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3720.332,3722.582,--because I think it would pose other constitutional problems.
1982.81-878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3722.582,3724.407,"Mr. Tribe, your time has expired."
1982.81-878,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3724.407,3725.19,Thank you very much.
1982.81-878,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3725.19,3726.579,Do you have anything further?
