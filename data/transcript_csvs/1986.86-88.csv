1986.86-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.247,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-88, Citicorp Industrial Credit versus William E. Brock."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,12.496,16.041,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.86-88,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.616,182.441,"Mr. Lee, has this question just never come up before in the context of a secured creditor?"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,182.441,191.61,"The Fair Labor Standards Act was... it has come up at least twice... well, several times."
1986.86-88,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.859,249.806,"The plain language of the statute does support the Respondent's view, and Congress twice, I guess, has amended the statute to take care of situations that apparently it hadn't thought about before."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,254.475,262.394,"Congress has amended the Act substantively, has amended the hot goods provision, once."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.121,325.181,Is that a general rule or do we know when we ignore the language and consult the spirit?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,328.211,354.185,"I think there is a real difference, Justice Scalia, between the kind of circumstance where Congress simply came up against the issue and there were competing views on both sides, neither side had the votes, and as a consequence they simply dodged it, and both sides made a lot of legislative history and then left it for this Court to fill in the details... I think that's one circumstance."
1986.86-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.595,465.89,"Does it seem to you like a bad statement of the law, what you just read?"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,465.89,476.979,"--What I just read, of course, whether it is good or bad, was the statement that was rejected by this Court in Holy Trinity."
1986.86-88,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.113,534.862,"Well, Mr. Lee, let me ask you one other question."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,548.857,550.387,"I'm not sure, I'm not sure."
1986.86-88,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.387,562.273,"Well, if it were only the minimum wage to remove the taint, certainly you could say that the statute... that your view continued to operate as to the difference between the minimum wage and the agreed wage."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,563.444,567.958,"Yes, and I would think it probably would only be the minimum wage."
1986.86-88,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.266,583.264,"--If that were true, then certainly the statute wouldn't completely have altered the priority of claims."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,589.512,612.893,"--There would be some money left, but insofar as the theory is concerned it would have changed around, it would have altered the priorities that are otherwise provided for, because the basic policy question is whose lien should be first, which claim should be first, in those instances where there is not enough money to go around."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,612.893,640.428,"Mr. Lee, is it common ground that, if the employer had not gone into insolvency and had simply failed to pay a certain amount of wages, he still has plenty of money and he's still in business, would it have been a violation of the Labor Standards Act to ship the goods that was made by the labor for which he has not yet paid the wages?"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,640.428,642.99,"Yes, yes."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.99,643.709,It would?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,643.709,644.318,Yes.
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.318,654.455,"I mean, it's clear that it's not just a violation of you contract for a lower wage, it's also a violation if you contract for a proper wage, but fail to pay it?"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,654.455,665.543,"I don't know that that is that clear, and that is another issue that... as far as I know, that is an issue that has simply never been decided."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.543,667.292,Are there any cases?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,667.292,669.433,"Not to my knowledge, not to my knowledge."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.433,674.806,"If that weren't a violation, then this whole problem--"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,674.806,676.086,"That is correct, that is correct."
1986.86-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,697.375,700.53,"--Well, you say he was paying the minimum wage but went broke."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,707.231,707.887,--That is correct.
1986.86-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,707.887,713.556,So you would put up a means test a defense for any employer sued under the Fair Labor Standards Act?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,713.556,732.955,"Well, it is simply another approach, another view that we think supports our position, that the Fair Labor Standards Act was not intended to apply to the insolvency circumstance, for a couple of reasons."
1986.86-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.955,737.593,This doesn't take away the property of the secured creditor.
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,739.514,740.03,That is correct.
1986.86-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.03,742.029,"Granted, that makes it largely valueless."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,746.387,749.824,"That is correct, and that's basically the Government's argument."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.66,899.826,"Mr. Lee, you said earlier that the Secretary has taken his current position only since the sixties; and for the first 25 years what was the situation?"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,902.418,905.339,We think he had taken the opposite position.
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.081,926.175,"Well, but that doesn't answer my question."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,931.75,936.264,"Yes, he had previously in our view taken exactly the opposite position."
1986.86-88,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.264,940.324,In what form did he take it?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,940.324,958.99,"It was in the form, Justice Brennan, of a statement in a... the BNA put put a manual called a manual for Fair Labor Standards Act compliance, and there was a statement in that manual that dealt with insurance against hot goods."
1986.86-88,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.787,1038.753,"Mr. Lee, can I ask you one other question about the history."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1047.001,1047.484,One.
1986.86-88,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.685,1053.248,Wasn't that in the eighties?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1053.248,1054.606,--'71.
1986.86-88,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.606,1055.466,That was '71.
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1055.466,1055.778,'71.
1986.86-88,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.007,1075.646,"But between that decision and this one, was there litigation all through the seventies?"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1078.411,1084.518,"Well, you know, they go for a quarter of a century and they don't do anything, and then they lose in '66, and then they lose again in '71."
1986.86-88,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.573,1101.011,Right.
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1101.011,1104.478,"All of their victories have been Sixth Circuit victories, and they've all come in the 1980's."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.712,1165.828,"You say it need not be, but all you appeal to is this Holy Trinity, which says it's a familiar principle, et cetera, et cetera, although it's apparently not a sufficiently familiar principle that counsel can ever find any case other than Holy Trinity to cite for it, because it's an old chestnut that comes up constantly when that principle is appealed to."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1181.837,1184.477,"Well, let me give you three brief answers."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.64,1212.139,"They made an exception for ministers, is that right?"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1212.139,1212.389,No.
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.087,1222.368,You don't think they might have had some First Amendment concerns?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1222.368,1225.351,They certainly didn't say so.
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.709,1231.286,Did they say what besides ministers were covered by the spirit of the law?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1231.286,1231.505,"No, no."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.505,1232.802,Just ministers?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1232.802,1240.751,"In the good spirit of true adjudication, they decided only that case that was before them at that particular instance."
1986.86-88,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.587,1346.851,"Mr. Lee, weren't there wage priorities in the 1938 Bankruptcy Act?"
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1350.333,1353.129,Junior to secured creditor.
1986.86-88,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1353.129,1354.16,"Yes, yes."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1359.705,1362.672,"Well, there is a very--"
1986.86-88,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.672,1369.108,"At least there's an inconsistency, you say, between the Bankruptcy Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1369.108,1369.733,--That is correct.
1986.86-88,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.733,1383.602,"And I suppose one argument is that the Bankruptcy Act impliedly repealed it or, if the Fair Labor Standards Act came afterwards, it really didn't intend to repeal the Bankruptcy Act."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1383.602,1393.629,"That's exactly right, and that is one of the most powerful arguments for Congress' real intent that there is in this whole case."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.631,1426.053,"Well, but of course."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1436.221,1436.58,--That is correct.
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.58,1439.782,"Your clients can sell the stuff in intrastate commerce, I presume."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1439.782,1441.344,"That is correct, that is correct."
1986.86-88,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.171,1450.7,"Well, they can't sell it in intrastate commerce if they think the seller is going to sell it in interstate commerce."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1450.7,1452.262,"--That is correct, that is correct."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.54,1461.851,Was that the interpretation current at the time of the Fair Labor Standards Act?
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1461.851,1465.865,"Probably not, probably not."
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1504.052,1505.099,They didn't intend to.
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1519.125,1520.562,--I would not put it that way.
1986.86-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.562,1522.046,"Well then, maybe this was a mistake."
1986.86-88,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1522.046,1524.669,I would not put it that Congress cannot make a mistake.
1986.86-88,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.687,1559.857,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1561.826,1565.076,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1601.654,1603.935,"Mr. Rothfeld, does the statute provide for that cure?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1603.935,1606.449,"No, that has been the Secretary's interpretation."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1606.449,1609.37,That is something that has been added to the language of the statute.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1613.227,1614.821,"Well, the statute, as you say--"
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.821,1616.976,Because the goods were produced in violation of the statute.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1616.976,1618.507,--That's true.
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.507,1626.972,"So how... where does the Secretary get the authority to okay a cure of that kind, in plain violation of the language of the statute?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1626.972,1632.063,"Well, I think the Secretary's interpretation is not in plain violation of the language of the statute."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.56,1642.465,xxx in any way.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1642.465,1646.261,"That's true, Justice Stevens, the statute doesn't address that issue at all."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.693,1670.391,"Well, why is that any different from reading into the statute an exception for a business that just goes out of business and there's no ongoing violation, which is what Congress was obviously really thinking about?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1670.391,1672.437,"--I think that's quite different, Justice Stevens."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1701.021,1706.238,"No, it says no one can sell goods which were produced under these conditions."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1710.469,1713.312,"As I say, Justice Stevens, that's true."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.826,1722.777,"Is he interpreting the statute necessarily, or maybe exercising his own prosecutorial discretion?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1722.777,1723.871,"--Well, that is one--"
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.871,1737.944,"Just as a prosecutor may say, I'm not going to prosecute for a small amount of marijuana, maybe the Secretary thinks that his prosecutorial discretion is better used on other things than seeking a remedy for wages that have been paid up."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1737.944,1741.77,"--That is one, I think one approach to what the Secretary is doing."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.77,1750.265,"So the Secretary would have had authority, if it wanted to, over these intervening years, simply not to enforce this provision in bankruptcy situations?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1750.265,1751.296,That's true.
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.296,1753.077,The statute doesn't require it.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1757.123,1758.419,"That's quite right, Justice Stevens."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.181,1768.587,xxx.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1768.587,1770.32,"--Clearly not, clearly not."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.32,1778.192,Do you agree with your opponent's view that the same plain language argument would apply to the bankruptcy trustee?
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1778.192,1779.926,"I think so, Justice Stevens."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1780.426,1791.702,"So if a bankruptcy trustee, say, comes into possession of a large inventory of goods that have to be liquidated, he may not liquidate them, at least in interstate commerce, period?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1791.702,1793.936,"--Well, let me say several things about that, Justice."
1986.86-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.936,1798.747,"Or without paying them at least, which gives the wage earners a priority in bankruptcy."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1798.747,1803.229,"Well, as I said, there are several responses to that point, Justice Stevens."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1811.538,1818.192,"Yes, but there are a lot of bankruptcy situations in which you get the secured creditor, I'm sure, claiming the right to dispose of goods."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1818.755,1824.783,"--No, that is true, although the Court's decision here doesn't necessarily have to reach that."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1824.783,1833.545,"--I don't see why not, if the rule is that... all the policy reasons supporting the Government's position would apply equally in an ordinary bankruptcy, without any secured creditors."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1833.545,1835.794,"Well, I think actually that is quite right, Justice Stevens."
1986.86-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.544,1956.403,"xxx as a matter of law, is that it, not just discretion?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1956.403,1959.432,"--Well, I think the Secretary--"
1986.86-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.432,1962.961,"That's the way you put it, anyway, although the law doesn't say that."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1962.961,1964.54,"--That is how I put it, Justice."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.707,1979.799,"Do you think, Mr. Rothfeld, in the flammable fabrics example that you have discretion to permit these dangerous products to be shipped in interstate commerce?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1989.06,1992.497,"--Well, there would have to be an enforcement action of some sort."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.497,1998.385,"But you don't think that the Secretary would have discretion to say, well, we realize these are very dangerous, but we're too busy to enforce this statute?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1998.385,2002.102,"Well, I think it would be inappropriate for an enforcement official to do that."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.102,2003.647,There is some difference between the two?
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2003.647,2006.179,"Well, but the nature of the statutes are identical."
1986.86-88,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.126,2041.992,"Well, but there is, it seems to me, a considerable difference between some item that's perhaps made out of flammable fabrics and is simply dangerous, branded so by the statutory scheme, and say an automobile that may have been manufactured by a bankrupt automobile company, that the last couple weeks didn't pay minimum wages."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2053.425,2062.016,"Well, I'm not sure that's entirely true, as a flammable fabric can be cured, can be brought Into conformity with the federal standards."
1986.86-88,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.871,2083.663,"But certainly we shouldn't strain to reach a result that says Congress intended that these particular goods simply rot here because their defect can't be cured and they can't be shipped, if there's nothing really inherently wrong with the goods."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2090.551,2092.737,"--Well, let me answer that in two ways, Justice Rehnquist."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2107.716,2108.669,You say we all agree.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2109.855,2111.324,"--Well, I should say--"
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.324,2113.916,It's plainly in violation of the statute if one's going to read it literally.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2113.916,2116.056,"--Well, I should say the parties, I think, agree."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.056,2116.525,All right.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2116.525,2126.6,"And as to whether the Secretary will enforce the statute under those circumstances, I think it is clear the regulations would permit these goods to be introduced into interstate commerce."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.6,2138.376,"Maybe you agreed too readily that the goods are manufactured in violation of the statute, if the proper wages are not paid before they are rolling off the press."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2156.43,2158.992,"Well, not at all, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.992,2177.233,"Well, then maybe goods, you know, manufactured in violation of the Act doesn't mean that payment has to be made before they are manufactured; it just means that payment of the wages has to be made at some point, and if it's made at some point the goods have not been manufactured in violation of the Act."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2181.045,2183.841,"Well, I don't think that that's true, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.841,2186.465,He's trying to help you a little.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2196.101,2198.586,"Well, I think that's right, Justice Stevens."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.617,2249.705,"Mr. Rothfeld, supposing you got an accumulation of inventory that was manufactured without the payroll being met for three or four weeks, and there are not enough assets in the estate to make up the wage shortage so the goods could... you could not generate enough money to comply with the statute."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2252.36,2262.2,"--Well, I think it will be an extraordinary situation where the goods themselves are worth less than the value of the labor that went into them."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.152,2265.621,It depends on how long this has been accumulating.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2265.621,2268.948,"--Well, if there were a case--"
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.948,2277.834,"They may have shipped 90 percent of those, but then the ten percent that's left over in inventory is not enough to pay for the full, you know, the full amount of the arrearage."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2278.162,2285.488,"--Well, if there were a case where it were impossible to pay the employees what they were owed, the statutory language is quite clear."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2290.126,2294.188,"So the trustee would just have to dispose of those goods, even though it's highly uneconomic?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2294.188,2303.902,"Well, as I say, Justice Stevens, that is a situation which I think is unlikely and that's demonstrated by the fact that it has never arisen In the 50 years the Act has been in operation."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.902,2317.647,"Mr. Rothfeld, am I correct that it is also common ground between you and Mr. Lee that there is going to be a frustration of the bankruptcy laws by reason of the Fair Labor Standards Act in a lot of situations?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2335.515,2337.889,"The answer is both yes and no, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.619,2346.228,All right.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2363.877,2366.799,"Well, let me give you two answers to that."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.796,2418.246,"Mr. Rothfeld, in the normal violation situation doesn't the employee have a claim against his employer for a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2418.246,2421.292,"Yes, an employee is given a right under Section 216."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.292,2423.993,But he doesn't have a right to invoke this particular provision?
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2423.993,2424.618,That's quite right.
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.793,2468.023,"And the purpose of that is to prevent the goods going into the market at depressed prices because they were produced at depressed wages, I suppose."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2468.023,2469.71,"Well, there are a variety of purposes to be served."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2469.71,2476.098,But one of the things is unfair competition to the employers who pay a decent wage scale.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2476.098,2477.426,"Well, that's quite true, Justice."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.426,2482.657,"And of course, that purpose would not be served by the sale of these goods anyway, even after the wages are paid."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2487.922,2489.077,"Well, let me take a step backward."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.077,2491.638,So that purpose isn't served no matter which way we decide this case.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2491.638,2492.56,"Well, I don't think that's true."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.068,2512.395,The goal itself is offended by these--
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2512.395,2513.817,"--Well, I think that's right--"
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.817,2516.331,--these wicked goods being in interstate commerce?
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2522.485,2529.779,"--Well, all I can tell you, Justice Scalia, is Congress endorsed the description of the goods offered by President Roosevelt--"
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2529.779,2533.185,"--It's a public policy, we don't want these offensive goods moving?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2536.464,2537.12,"--Oh, yes."
1986.86-88,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2543.056,2551.364,"That was in the tradition of a lot of these Acts, the Webb-Kenyon Act, the Asher-Summers Act, that all described the tainted goods interstate commerce."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2553.238,2556.471,"Well, that's quite right, Justice Rehnquist."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.791,2585.242,"Of course, that rhetoric applies to an ongoing business doing it month after month after month."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2590.551,2592.066,"--Well, again--"
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.066,2594.393,Don't you get the same price whether the employees were paid or not?
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2596.206,2602.281,"--Well, there were a number of purposes to be served."
1986.86-88,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2651.777,2664.272,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, there really is no concrete evidence in the legislative history, is there, to tell us that Congress was thinking about this problem of the bankrupt employer?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2664.272,2669.113,"Well, I think the clearest evidence of what Congress had in mind, Justice O'Connor, is what it said, and what it said is every employer--"
1986.86-88,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2669.113,2671.05,You have to fall back on plain language.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2673.612,2677.156,"--Well, I think it does appear in the legislative history."
1986.86-88,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.156,2682.171,"Well, do you feel, if you had the choice between the plain language and the legislative history, which would you choose?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2682.171,2685.608,"Well, I think we've clearly won on the plain language, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2699.993,2706.863,"Do you have any cases in which, never mind bankruptcy, but you just have had an employer who has not paid his employees?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2718.515,2719.78,"We think it is clear, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.598,2750.814,"If they're sued for back pay, why do you have to use the Fair Labor Standards Act?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2750.814,2754.328,"Well, the Fair Labor Standards Act provides a number of--"
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.328,2758.624,"I mean, if he's promised to pay it it doesn't matter whether he is legally obliged to promise to pay it."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2760.685,2763.075,"--Well, I think that that's not quite right, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.401,2769.667,I see.
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2769.667,2772.93,It provides liquidated damages and it allows the Secretary to sue.
1986.86-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.879,2798.873,"Do you have cases where the employer has also been forbidden to ship his inventory in interstate commerce, just because he hasn't paid wages which were above the minimum?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2798.873,2801.856,--I'm not aware of any cases in which the hot goods clause--
1986.86-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.856,2803.714,"That would be sort of self-defeating, wouldn't it?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2808.323,2813.648,"--Well, generally speaking an employer must pay its employees in the course of business."
1986.86-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.648,2815.741,"Of course, of course."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2815.741,2816.601,An employer can't operate on the edge.
1986.86-88,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.601,2827.782,"So I ask you, are there some cases where the employer has been forbidden to ship his goods in interstate commerce or to sell the goods until he's paid unpaid wages?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2827.782,2830.204,"I am not aware of any reported decisions, Justice White."
1986.86-88,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2851.633,2864.004,"Mr. Rothfeld, what about the point Mr. Lee makes, that the Secretary has taken a contrary position in the past?"
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2864.004,2866.175,"Well, I think that's simply not true, Justice O'Connor."
1986.86-88,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2941.191,2948.407,"Within the period between 1938 and 1966, this fact pattern surely arose many, many times."
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2948.407,2952.219,"--Well, I'm not sure that's true."
1986.86-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.252,3029.875,The SG's office isn't promising not to cite Holy Trinity to us in the future?
1986.86-88,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3029.875,3032.436,"I cannot make that commitment for all time, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3318.023,3345.545,"One objective of the Fair Labor Standards Act was to force the payment of minimum wages by chiseling employers, and it had one other objective which was supportive thereof, and that was to take away the competitive advantage in interstate commerce that the substandard employers would enjoy vis a vis those who had paid standard wages."
1986.86-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3373.565,3390.386,"Mr. Lee, you do acknowledge that you have got a problem with the Bankruptcy Act in the case where... I mean, assuming that this affects priorities, you have a problem where the employer has intentionally paid substandard wages."
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3393.776,3398.992,"No, not where it's intentionally, but where there's been some complicity between the creditor and the employer."
1986.86-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3398.992,3420.951,"--Oh, you say that even where the employer has contracted, and not because of insolvency but he's been a bad actor all along, he's contracted for substandard wages, if he later goes into bankruptcy you think that even those goods can be shipped in interstate commerce?"
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3420.951,3423.498,Once they're in the hands--
1986.86-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3423.498,3424.325,Once they're in the hands?
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3424.325,3424.825,"--Yes, yes."
1986.86-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3424.825,3425.372,I see.
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3425.372,3435.961,"As they are... as he has exercised his secured lien, unless there is some complicity, unless there is some fault on the part of the secured creditor."
1986.86-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3435.961,3436.742,Okay.
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3437.93,3451.797,There is no question that Congress has the power to repeal state and federal laws dealing with these lien priorities and to move wage creditors to the head of the line.
1986.86-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3534.843,3546.385,"The only cases in 200 years in which you think Congress has written a statute that picks up something that maybe, had they thought about it, they wouldn't have wanted to pick it up, and we caught both of them?"
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3549.446,3555.179,"But the point is that in every instance where you caught it, you were consistent."
1986.86-88,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3561.131,3568.298,"Mr. Lee, may I ask you, do you think the Johnson case we decided the other day is such a case, the Weber case is such a case?"
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3568.298,3573.062,"Oh, Johnson, I do know the Johnson case, I do know the Johnson case."
1986.86-88,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.482,3578.279,"The language is pretty clear there, wasn't it?"
1986.86-88,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3578.279,3581.823,--That goes back to the conversation that I had with Justice Scalia.
1986.86-88,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3611.906,3613.093,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
