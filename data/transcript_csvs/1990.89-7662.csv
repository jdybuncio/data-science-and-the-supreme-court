1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-7662, Roger Keith Coleman v. Charles E. Thompson."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,14.391,16.907,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.103,150.262,"Mr. Hall, in the practice in the Supreme Court of Virginia does that court ordinarily dismiss a petition, as they did here, when they are deciding the merits of a case?"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,150.262,161.701,The use of the word dismissal alone is unusual based upon our examination of Virginia cases.
1990.89-7662,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.09,221.109,"Well, Mr. Hall, the court--"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,221.109,221.626,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-7662,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.626,229.179,"--unambiguously, as you have put it, granted the State's motion to dismiss."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,266.055,280.045,"Well, it strikes me, Justice O'Connor, that there are, in any kind of order like this, particularly a procedural bar in a summary, basically summary order, there are a number of possibilities."
1990.89-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,350.391,353.826,"Well, I don't read O'Brien as being a late filing case."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,354.862,355.512,It's not a late filing.
1990.89-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.478,360.014,--Well... but that's different under Virginia law.
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,369.372,370.472,That's correct.
1990.89-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,370.472,379.478,And the notice of appeal precedes by some 60 days the date when the petition for the appeal is due.
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,385.482,397.939,"I don't believe, Justice Kennedy, that that notion, that distinction between jurisdiction and a mandatory rule is sustainable under Virginia practice."
1990.89-7662,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.561,474.022,Do you have any Virginia Supreme Court case that says that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is not a procedural bar?
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,474.022,479.676,"The closest I come to that is Socony, and the analysis of Socony."
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,568.001,582.594,"Mr. Hall, do you have any case from the Supreme Court of Virginia where that court has dismissed a petition for appeal but nonetheless decided the merits?"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,584.277,584.727,"This case, Your Honor."
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.727,608.478,"--Well, yeah, but you... you have to get your strength from some other case, it seems to me, because what we're looking at here is something that one thinks of as being peculiar to procedural motions to dismiss an appeal rather than to simply affirm, which is what you would do if you found... considered the merits things and found them to be insubstantial."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,608.478,643.699,"Mr. Chief Justice, I submit, though, that Ake is a kind of case that presents exactly that issue, and the practice of the Virginia Supreme Court, as revealed in the Tharp case, which is a case in which the court recognized that it had been perhaps too lenient in excusing its mandatory rules, and the Socony Mobil case, O'Brien against Socony Mobil, is precisely that kind of case where the court recognizes that it can look through to the merits and inform its procedural decision on that basis."
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.719,711.11,"You're relying here essentially on Harris, and not on an argument that this was a ground that was applied... a procedural ground that was unevenly applied, that was applied in this case but perhaps--"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,711.11,714.546,We are not making an adequacy argument in that sense.
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.546,715.013,"--Yes, yes."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,715.48,717.865,That is correct.
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,781.523,783.975,"When you say Ake, you're talking about Ake against Oklahoma?"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,783.975,792.848,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1990.89-7662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.539,832.489,"They didn't know about Harris at the time, did they?"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,832.489,833.575,"Well, that's true, and--"
1990.89-7662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.575,834.691,"It makes a difference, don't you think?"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,834.691,835.942,--I don't think so.
1990.89-7662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.44,875.152,"No, I think you would have a much stronger case if we had said that you have to have an, you know, express indication, and after we said that the Virginia court came down with this, which as you say is arguably not express."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,880.888,888.809,"But Long had been issued, and the general notion of the requirement for a plain statement was in existence."
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.946,893.846,--In quite a different context.
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,899.267,899.95,That's correct.
1990.89-7662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.27,984.123,"Mr. Hall, do you take it that our cases absolutely prohibit us from saying that a State can sometimes look at the merits and exceptionally decide to receive a pleading even though it's late because the merits look so bad, even though in other cases it simply follows its normal procedures and dismisses for lateness?"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,984.123,1002.1,"I think there is a basis for a distinction in following a plain error kind of analysis, where a State establishes a rule of State law that is based on the concepts of prejudice or harmless error under State law that would permit it to do that."
1990.89-7662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.312,1033.638,"Well, what if, what if you just have a rule that we'll always look at the merits, but ordinarily, almost invariably we'll follow the time limit set forth in our statute."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1045.546,1060.004,"Lots of States do have that rule, and I think it's a plain error rule, and I believe that there is a good basis for saying that the Federal merits were not decided in a case like that."
1990.89-7662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.206,1063.539,Right.
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1063.539,1080.751,But it wasn't decided in the others because there is a State... what basically it does is it assumes the validity of the Federal claim and then inquires into prejudice or extraordinary circumstances or something that at least intellectually is separate from the Federal merits.
1990.89-7662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.751,1083.869,Is it clear to you that that is not what Virginia is doing here?
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1083.869,1084.752,Yes.
1990.89-7662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.752,1089.321,Why?
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1089.321,1093.308,O'Brien against Socony doesn't follow that kind of analysis.
1990.89-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.814,1143.574,"It's an odd calculus that you're suggesting, that is to say if there is a well-established Federal right under the... your plain error discussion, you assume the State relied on a procedural ground."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1155.216,1166.087,I don't think that that would be the circumstance which would cause the State court to limit itself in terms of its harmless error.
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.968,1218.206,"Mr. Hall, you raised three questions in your petition for certiorari, and so far I think you have just been discussing with us the first one."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1221.341,1222.191,Let me do that.
1990.89-7662,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1400.773,1402.058,"Well, Mr. Hall--"
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1402.058,1402.692,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-7662,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1402.692,1434.363,"--It seems to me that our cases in Wainwright against Sykes and in Murray against Carrier, and even in Harris itself, indicates that we have moved toward a general recognition of the legitimately... legitimacy of adequate and independent State procedural bars in Federal habeas proceedings."
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1434.363,1434.729,I don't--
1990.89-7662,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1434.729,1453.507,And I'm wondering whether we aren't... it wouldn't be proper here to apply the cause and prejudice standard of Wainwright against Sykes?
1990.89-7662,0,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1453.507,1469.334,"--The argument for doing that, I think, Justice O'Connor, requires an evaluation of these, of the characteristics that led to a departure of the deliberate by-pass standard that was in place before Wainwright against Sykes."
1990.89-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.421,1554.856,"Thank you, Mr. Hall."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1561.344,1565.129,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7662,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1696.308,1698.093,Was that part of the record in this case?
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1698.093,1699.51,"--No, it was not part of the record."
1990.89-7662,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1699.51,1704.081,"Well, I think that it's inappropriate for you to proceed on that basis."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1704.081,1710.151,"Well, my only point in bringing it up is that it only corroborates what the Fourth Circuit had done."
1990.89-7662,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.353,1716.638,Lots of things outside the record corroborate something courts have done.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1716.638,1717.255,--Right.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.266,1735.916,"General Curry, can I interrupt with another question?"
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1735.916,1736.299,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.299,1740.586,I didn't understand your opponent to be arguing that this was a miscarriage of justice case.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1745.472,1749.526,"Well, he argued the miscarriage of justice exception all the way through the Fourth Circuit."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1749.526,1750.659,But I don't think he has here.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1750.659,1752.144,"Well, he put--"
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.144,1753.028,Am I not correct?
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1753.028,1755.446,--He put in his brief that he was innocent.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.83,1761.5,"Well, I know, but he has not argued that as a separate ground for reversing the court of appeals."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1772.189,1777.01,"--Well, his position was that the miscarriage of justice did apply."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1780.812,1785.948,"Yeah, but he also pleaded not guilty, but we're not going to argue again the original facts, are we?"
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1792.102,1798.423,"--Well, the point I was trying to make was that the Fourth Circuit has conducted the review of the actual innocence, and it does not apply."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.945,1808.731,"Well, we wouldn't if he won on one of the other grounds which we reach first."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1808.731,1811.397,--That's certainly true.
1990.89-7662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.108,1834.846,"Well, now your... are you going to address the first argument made by the petition?"
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1834.846,1836.531,About Harris v. Reed?
1990.89-7662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.531,1844.57,Whether there is here a State procedural bar that is independent of Federal law.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1844.57,1847.522,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I'll address that now."
1990.89-7662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.984,1874.72,"Well, what's the situation in Virginia?"
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1884.694,1898.769,"What that is referring to, Justice O'Connor, is the... the practice of when a petitioner in subsequent habeas corpus proceedings comes back and alleges that he was denied his right to appeal through the ineffective assistance of counsel."
1990.89-7662,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1921.601,1923.419,Is that a court-made rule?
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1923.419,1926.771,"--Yes, it is a court-made rule."
1990.89-7662,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1926.771,1927.721,And why is it jurisdictional?
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1929.307,1930.84,"Yes, they have repeatedly said that it is."
1990.89-7662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1946.518,1951.72,And what's your best authority for that--
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1951.72,1952.02,The rule--
1990.89-7662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.02,1953.505,--in light of Tharp and O'Brien?
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,1953.505,1958.992,--The rule itself says that it's... Rule 55 says that the rule is mandatory.
1990.89-7662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.627,2095.828,Did they ask for... I thought that they asked for the briefing on the merits.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2097.297,2098.514,"No, that is not correct."
1990.89-7662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.047,2099.649,It was not asked for.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2099.649,2101.916,--The case just went in due course.
1990.89-7662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.374,2112.857,I see.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2112.857,2114.659,I filed the motion to dismiss.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.063,2126.8,"If the law is as clear as you say it is, why did you bother to file a brief?"
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2126.8,2131.936,Because I had no... I had no choice but to file... if you're going to file a brief on the merits--
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.936,2132.638,What do you mean you had no choice?
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2136.405,2138.357,"--Well, that's certainly true."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.845,2144.211,But you didn't have to.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2145.328,2147.713,I don't see anything--
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.713,2149.915,Actions sometimes speak louder than words.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2149.915,2152.432,"--Well, I don't see anything unreasonable about--"
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2152.432,2162.057,"There's nothing unreasonable it, but apparently you were not confident that the case would be dismissed as untimely, and therefore, as a good lawyer should, you protected yourself by filing a brief on the merits."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2162.057,2163.223,"--That is certainly true, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.717,2209.454,The other thing that's puzzling is why would it take the supreme court 4 months to decide such a simple motion?
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2209.454,2214.073,"--Well, as I said, I don't think you can read much into it other than they just got to it in due course."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.547,2224.213,"Oh, I see."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2224.213,2224.947,--Virginia law at a later date.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.947,2226.499,"Yeah, right."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2226.499,2230.284,And that his notice of appeal was timely.
1990.89-7662,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.013,2257.284,I don't suppose there would be any question in this case if the court in dismissing had said expressly we dismiss for late filing.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2257.284,2258.384,That's true.
1990.89-7662,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.47,2263.672,Even if they had spent months looking at the merits to see if they ought to waive the rule.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2263.672,2264.188,--That's right.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.444,2435.566,"General Curry, I don't really understand that argument, because the facts are rather clear... I mean, there isn't a dispute about the fact that it was an attorney error that caused the failure to make a timely appeal."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2437.668,2438.435,--That's right.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.435,2441.454,"Well, I don't know why... you either decide that's a sufficient cause or it isn't."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2445.006,2445.441,Well--
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.441,2452.095,"I guess your position it is not sufficient cause unless the counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective, that's what you--"
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2452.095,2452.662,--That's right.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.662,2453.528,--Yeah.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2453.528,2462.533,"But, you know, what you're assuming is that you would have different counsel between State and Federal habeas, like you have in this case."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.937,2469.739,I don't understand why you'd have to have different counsel.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2482.214,2492.137,"Justice Stevens, I have just never heard of a situation where counsel can go into a proceeding and attempt to excuse a default based on his own alleged ineffectiveness."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2494.939,2497.457,"Well, it happens all the time in late appeal situations."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2509.045,2510.68,But as a practical matter that's not going to happen.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.786,2519.436,Right.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2519.436,2528.142,And then it's going to take new counsel and a new petition to say that the original habeas attorneys were ineffective in not raising specified claims.
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.178,2532.444,"Well, if you go to a failure to raise specified claims, I would agree with you."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2545.687,2564.999,"Well, even, even under Coleman's rule there would be nothing in his case to prevent subsequent counsel from coming back... under the rule as he has formulated it... from coming back and in another proceeding alleging that first and second habeas counsel were ineffective in not raising ineffective counsel claims that we haven't heard of yet."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.999,2566.034,"No, I agree with you."
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2586.68,2608.111,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think that Carrier decided that in terms of the costs to the interest that we're concerned about, finality, comity, and federalism, the costs are the same regardless of whether the error is based on a tactical decision, inadvertence, negligence, whatever."
1990.89-7662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.547,2717.232,Tell us about it.
1990.89-7662,1,20699,donald_r_curry,,2717.232,2719.934,"--Well, I'm sure the Court's aware of it."
1990.89-7662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.327,2786.344,"Thank you, Mr. Curry."
1990.89-7662,2,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,2789.211,2792.982,"Yes, briefly."
1990.89-7662,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2822.316,2825.986,Was that a post-Harris order?
1990.89-7662,2,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,2825.986,2827.737,--That is a pre-Harris order.
1990.89-7662,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2935.841,2953.052,"Where you say that petitioner hasn't had a fair opportunity, your definition of fair opportunity is such that the fact that the State accorded a fair opportunity if its rules were complied with isn't enough if counsel missed the boat."
1990.89-7662,2,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,2953.052,2959.206,"--In the circumstances of this case, missing the boat, where your client wants you to file and you make a mistake of this kind, that's right."
1990.89-7662,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.444,3004.069,"Mr. Hall, what's your response to the fact that the last time this case was up here you argued that in fact the Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal was a procedural dismissal?"
1990.89-7662,2,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,3004.069,3005.085,The argument there was--
1990.89-7662,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3005.085,3006.937,Do you feel bad about switching on us like that?
1990.89-7662,2,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,3006.937,3009.556,--I don't think that... I didn't argue that particular--
1990.89-7662,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3009.556,3010.123,"Well, all right."
1990.89-7662,2,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,3010.123,3012.591,"--point, but that's neither here nor there."
1990.89-7662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.842,3041.692,"Thank you, Mr. Hall."
1990.89-7662,2,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,3041.692,3042.408,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-7662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3042.408,3043.741,The case is submitted.
