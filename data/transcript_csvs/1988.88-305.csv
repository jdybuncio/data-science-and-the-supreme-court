1988.88-305,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,0.166,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-305, South Carolina v. Demetrius Gathers."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1266.597,1267.413,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.193,1347.565,Do you think a jury is very likely to find a voter registration card critical in deciding whether to impose life or death?
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1347.565,1353.183,"Absolutely not unless they're asked to do that in a closing argument by the solicitor, and that's what I'm submitting is a fair reading--"
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1353.183,1363.075,"Well, do... do you think the jury is likely to accede to the solicitor's suggestion that although in... if there... if it weren't for this voter registration card, he shouldn't get the death penalty?"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1367.777,1382.988,"--I think that a solicitor, a skillful and experienced solicitor, could take a piece of evidence like that and in the nature of the argument that was advanced in this case, that he is a... he is one of us, his life, because of that, is more valuable and--"
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.988,1383.338,But--
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1383.338,1386.873,--therefore based on that a death... a death sentence would be appropriate.
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.873,1397.562,"--Well, I can see the solicitor relying on a number of factors, but the idea that it all turns on the voter registration card, which I thought perhaps was your position, makes little sense to me."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1397.562,1415.173,"Justice Rehnquist, the solicitor argued that these factors... and if you look at this argument in context, the Game Guy's Prayer card... the fact that this man was a Christian and the fact that he was a registered voter who believed in his community and participated in the process, cry out from the grave in support of a sentence of death."
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1437.556,1440.758,What's your authority for that proposition?
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1440.758,1449.431,"--Well, would cite the Court to the language in Booth v. Maryland itself where this Court cites Zant v. Stephens."
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1538.921,1549.296,"in this case, I take it the two cards you complain about were received in evidence at the guilt it phase without objection."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1549.296,1550.096,That's correct.
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1550.096,1552.081,And the jury properly looked at them.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1552.081,1552.698,That's correct.
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1552.698,1555.533,The same jury served as the sentencing jury.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1556.133,1557.402,That's right.
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1557.402,1572.411,"Do you suppose that it could be said that in view of the evidence of the extreme brutality of this crime and the circumstances of it, that any reference by the prosecutor to these items was harmless?"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1572.411,1577.779,"Justice O'Connor, I don't think that it would be fair to characterize this as merely a reference."
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1589.337,1591.087,"Well, the jury had read it already, for goodness sakes."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1595.407,1608.632,"--It had been in evidence, and he reread the card, the Game Guy's Prayer, in the context of using that card and Mr. Haynes' belief in it in and of itself as a basis for imposing a death sentence in the case."
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.536,1641.636,"But they were also admitted at the guilt phase, weren't they?"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1641.636,1644.138,--That... that was on the question of guilt.
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.172,1647.107,Weren't they also admitted at the penalty phase?
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1647.107,1651.911,"--Well, it was a wholesale admission of all of the evidence that was admitted at the guilt phase."
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.911,1653.878,"So, they were admitted at the penalty--"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1653.878,1654.862,That's correct.
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1702.76,1710.014,"--Of course, I take it your position would be the same under Booth if the victim was... was blind or helpless or an infant."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1712.116,1718.27,"--Of course, it can consider it if those handicaps reflect on he characteristic of the defendant."
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1787.699,1793.603,"So, If you shoot a gun... so, if you shoot a gun and you hit school children and you shoot a gun and you hit dope dealers, is the penalty the same?"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1793.603,1795.269,The... the culpability--
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1795.269,1796.119,Constitutionally.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1796.119,1803.542,"--The culpability certainly takes into account a child versus an adult, and certainly that would be considered."
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.542,1805.661,It does under Booth in your view.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1807.777,1811.196,I believe that it is something that reflects on the characteristic of the defendant.
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.196,1813.731,"Only If you know, only if you know I understood--"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1813.731,1814.267,That's right.
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.817,1816.45,--Justice Kennedy's question to be a random shot.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1816.45,1817.219,"That... okay, I'm sorry."
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.17,1820.736,Random shooting--
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1820.736,1821.403,Culpability would be the same.
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1821.403,1827.907,--And I take it your position would be the same if the jury simply mentioned this on its own.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1841.834,1843.786,I'm not sure that I follow that... that question.
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1844.486,1858.711,"Suppose the jury on its own considers factors that the Booth case tells us the prosecution cannot mention, i.e., the victim was a decent person in the community--"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1858.711,1859.478,--Uh-hum.
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1859.478,1865.132,--or a blind person or an infant or a president... all of those things--
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1865.132,1865.582,Well--
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1865.582,1871.686,--would be grounds for reversal I take it if the jury considered them on their own as opposed to the prosecution mentioning them?
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1871.686,1873.971,"--I think that the... you know, that's why we have juries."
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1881.625,1886.696,So now... so now we have the position that the jury can consider things that the prosecution can't mention?
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1886.696,1899.521,"Well, I don't... unless it's obvious that... that the jury is going to do that and... and you can cure that by some kind of limiting instruction, I don't see now you could go into the jury room and prevent deliberations on certain aspects of the case."
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1899.521,1901.788,"Well, I'm talking about what the constitutional duty of a jury is."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1907.525,1933.842,"Well, the... I think what you're going to have to do is allow each side to present the evidence that's presentable under the rules of evidence in the case, let that case go to the jury with proper instructions that are applicable to the evidence that has been introduced, and then allow the jury to... to consider the circumstances of this crime and the characteristics of the defendant and make a decision as to what the sentence should be."
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.842,1936.711,Why would you request an instruction from the judge?
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1949.519,1950.102,Characteristics of--
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.102,1959.993,"I enjoin you not to consider those characteristics because it has nothing to do with the... for purposes of the guilt phase, for purpose of the penalty, I enjoin you to not consider any of those characteristics."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1959.993,1962.41,--Do you mean the characteristics of the victim or the defendant?
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.41,1963.429,Of... of the victim.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1964.961,1966.063,"Well, at--"
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.063,1967.93,"You should get an instruction like that, shouldn't you?"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1967.93,1975.586,--I don't think that we're talking about at the guilt phase of a proceeding where the question at issue is the guilt or innocence of the accused.
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.586,1976.452,I'm sorry.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,1996.916,2002.904,"I don't think... when I mentioned limiting instructions, of course, I'm not talking about that situation."
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.627,2014.127,"Well, why?"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2018.865,2032.589,"--I don't think that if it has... I think it if has nothing to do... I would submit if it has nothing to do with the circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the... of the defendant, then it has no relevancy to the moral culpability of the defendant."
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2032.589,2039.694,"So, the jury should not consider it and it would be okay to... and probably desirable to instruct the jury not to consider it."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2039.694,2048.467,"If... if the evidence showed that it did not in some way cast light on the moral culpability of the accused, then that's correct."
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2048.467,2050.333,xxx.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2057.572,2057.94,If--
1988.88-305,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2057.94,2059.44,That's your definition of moral culpability.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2059.44,2073.0,"--If the victim is aware... I mean, if the victim's characteristics are known to the accused and some way can be shown to be an impetus for the murderous act, then it certainly would be proper--"
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2073.0,2083.371,"What if in this case the evidence showed that it was broad daylight and the defendant read every word of the voter registration card and the prayer, and then went on and did what he did?"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2083.371,2094.679,--If you could... if you could fairly infer from that record that the defendant read that card and said I don't like Christians and I don't like voters--
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2094.679,2094.963,"No, no."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2110.791,2111.191,--Well--
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.191,2114.743,And he reads all that and then does the terrible things that he did to this victim.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2114.743,2126.8,--I would... I would answer that by saying if the prosecution can't demonstrate that that knowledge was in some way responsible for the accused's actions--
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2126.8,2140.644,You don't think that the knowledge goes to the moral culpability of the defendant who knows what he has here in the way of a victim and then cold-bloodedly does the things that this person did to this old man?
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2140.644,2149.083,"--Justice O'Connor, I don't think that his moral culpability would be enhanced because he selected a Christian as opposed to some other individual to murder."
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2150.216,2156.254,"We don't know the nature of the religious belief, just some poor, old soul who had these characteristics."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2161.307,2170.746,"--I would submit that it would not be permitted to be so under the Constitution, under the language that this Court wrote in the Zant v. Stephens case."
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2170.746,2178.269,What if the defendant goes in and rapes and murders a mother with sleeping children nearby?
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2186.356,2188.041,That he knows the circumstances that this... that--
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2188.041,2193.445,Victim is a mother and is going to leave orphan children when he's finished.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2194.779,2196.545,--Absolutely it does go to it.
1988.88-305,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2205.218,2212.389,"--And precisely so here with this poor, old fellow on the park bench."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2212.389,2219.542,"Well, he knew that the victim in this case had personal effects that were rummaged through."
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.24,2252.596,But you can't show that the... the mother with her young children... you probably can't show that the young children were an impetus for the murder.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2253.746,2259.333,"Well, I think it goes... in that situation, it clearly goes to moral culpability because he's aware of the fact."
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.952,2268.154,"So, if this... if this fellow on the park bench had had a small son with him, that could have come in, but the rest couldn't."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2268.154,2268.604,That's right.
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.687,2405.394,"Well, then you would think the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case would have relied on the principle you're talking about rather than relying on our federal constitutional decision in Booth."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2405.394,2419.904,"--Well, basically the law in South Carolina is that a victim's characteristics are irrelevant to a sentencing consideration because all individuals have that same right of protection in South Carolina not to be murdered unlawfully or not to be killed unlawfully."
1988.88-305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.962,2435.497,"Mr. Diggs, has that always been the law of South Carolina."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2446.554,2448.654,"--Well, I... I assume that it was."
1988.88-305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.756,2458.778,"Perhaps the prosecutor had a special burden here if it wasn't so because he had a black on both... I take it the defendant was black, was he not also?"
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2458.778,2459.245,That's correct.
1988.88-305,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.245,2462.397,Yes.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2462.397,2496.385,"But the position that the Respondent takes in the case is that because human life is valued equally in South Carolina under this statute, and because the status of the law at the time of this case, as reflected in the adoption of the statute back in 1977, if you look at the aggravating circumstances that the general assembly has adopted which permits... the presence of which permits the state to seek a death penalty, they have nothing to do with victims' characteristics because victims aren't valued equally."
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.903,2674.483,"Well, I assume you wouldn't be able to get in... If the theory on which this were admitted were... were not Just that these were characteristics of the victim, which the jury can take into account, but rather they were characteristics of the victim that the defendant knew of and therefore the Jury can take it into account, I suppose you wouldn't be able to introduce any rebuttal evidence unless you could also show that the defendant knew of that."
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2684.291,2686.827,"Well, I think under my--"
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.827,2688.127,--It gets curiouser and curiouser.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2688.127,2689.377,"--Under my argument, that's correct."
1988.88-305,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.377,2689.879,Yes.
1988.88-305,1,44481,william_isaac_diggs,,2689.879,2727.885,"But if the law is that the evidence is admissible anyway regardless of whether it reflects on circumstances of the crime or characteristics of the defendant, then you would obviously have a right and a duty to go out and solicit or dig up the information that shows the contrary and introduce it at... at the sentencing phase in mitigation."
1988.88-305,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.271,2733.738,"Thank you, Mr. Diggs."
