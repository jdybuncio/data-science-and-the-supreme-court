1991.90-6531,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,23.444,"We will now hear oral argument in No. 90-6531, Keith J. Hudson v. Jack McMillian, et al.--"
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,78.703,88.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.281,321.559,"Do you object just to the first part of the Fifth Circuit's four-part test, the significant injury part?"
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,325.26,328.774,I think the other factors are rather confusing.
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,332.882,336.318,What case do you think provides the proper standard?
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,339.254,345.408,"--I don't think we need to reach that, Justice O'Connor, in this case because whatever the standard is--"
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.408,353.562,"Well, would you answer me, please, what case do you think provides the proper standard for a case of this kind?"
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,353.562,371.663,"--I think in this case where there was no penalogical justification for the behavior of the officers, where there was no emergency, where there was no tense situation, there was no need to make split-second decisions, the test ought to be deliberate indifference: that is, the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain."
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.663,391.921,"I would have thought that probably Whitley provided the standard in asking whether the force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or whether it was done maliciously or sadistically for the purpose of causing harm."
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,391.921,393.124,Whitley--
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.124,395.576,"I would think that would fit, would it not?"
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,395.576,400.948,"--It does fit, but I don't think it is a necessary standard in this case under these facts."
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.865,426.218,It sounds to me like you would think that we have to apply the standard for perhaps failure to provide medical care?
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,426.218,428.25,--It's similar.
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,429.078,434.139,But in that context we have said that significant harm has to ensue.
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,437.949,444.227,"--Well, I don't recall seeing significant harm in Estelle, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.227,455.91,I thought we had said that in the Estelle prison conditions format that there has to be a showing of prolonged and significant discomfort.
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,455.91,458.612,That was one of the things that had to be shown.
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.895,536.378,I guess you at least have to have injury in fact to have any standing?
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,536.378,538.83,Injury in fact?
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.83,539.189,Yes.
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,539.189,547.404,"Well, I think injury goes... it's probative of damages."
1991.90-6531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,549.42,552.013,And may be for constitutional standing?
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,552.013,563.352,"--Well, I would respectfully disagree that you need... if you're talking about physical injury... that may be where we are talking about two different things."
1991.90-6531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.469,636.056,"Mr. Bronstein, suppose... well, punish him or... suppose the same thing had happened after he was arrested but before he had been convicted, he got beat up by some prison guards, would he have had an Eighth Amendment claim?"
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,636.056,636.728,No.
1991.90-6531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.664,640.258,That's very strange.
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,640.258,642.929,--a substance due process claim or a Fourth Amendment claim.
1991.90-6531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.679,647.005,"Why should it change that way, that--"
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,647.005,650.799,This Court has said it changes that way upon conviction.
1991.90-6531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.799,656.797,--Is there any indication in this case that it was the policy of the prison to punish people this way?
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,656.797,659.296,"No, on the contrary."
1991.90-6531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.139,668.48,Were any of these officials at the policy level of the prison?
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,668.48,669.558,--Well--
1991.90-6531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.558,684.224,"The reason I am asking is, I mean, assuming we agree with you on the, you know, extent of the injury point, I just wonder whether we should remand for some further findings by the district court."
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,701.186,705.465,"--Respectfully, I disagree."
1991.90-6531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.072,836.615,Is it essential for you to win to win under... to win on the Eighth Amendment?
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,844.879,848.597,"Yes, I think a pre-trial detainee would win under a substantive due process claim."
1991.90-6531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.597,852.016,"Well, I suppose your client could too."
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,852.016,864.59,"Theoretically he could, but this Court on a number of occasions has said that the substantive due process right of a sentenced prisoner is redundant, that the Eighth Amendment is the one we must look to."
1991.90-6531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.59,870.9,"So you really are saying... you say, it is just as obvious as can be that this is punishment--"
1991.90-6531,0,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,870.9,871.681,That's right.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,1582.365,1589.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1620.475,1623.927,"Would you like to remind me, too?"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,1623.927,1624.88,--I beg your pardon.
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1624.88,1626.755,"Would you like to remind me, too?"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,1840.34,1841.856,The answer to that is--
1991.90-6531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.856,1843.886,"This is certainly above de minimis, isn't it?"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,1843.886,1845.261,"--No, we don't."
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.143,1915.17,Then you would think that the use of an electric prod pole or some kind of device like that that didn't leave any physical remnants on the prisoner would be perfectly okay.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,1916.855,1918.293,"No, that doesn't follow."
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1919.542,1920.573,I would think it would--
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,1920.573,1920.948,--It doesn't follow.
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1965.868,1983.578,"--But you think that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit having prison guards who will simply take one of the prisoners because he is not obeying their orders, hold him down and beat him up, just as long as all you have is a few bruises."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,1987.703,1993.747,"--I think that what you are suggesting is a conflict, if you will--"
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1993.747,1995.418,I'm asking what you're suggesting.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,1995.418,1998.292,"--I am sorry, Your Honor, with due deference."
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2021.625,2038.261,"Yes, and the magistrate even found that this was not a single isolated incident, but a part of a continuing series of events, and that the supervisor said, just go right ahead, boys, as long as you don't have too much fun."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2041.509,2045.194,"Almost exactly, Your Honor."
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.252,2227.668,"Well, I would have thought this case came a lot closer to Whitley, it being a case where the prison guards were trying to maintain discipline and so is this."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2231.027,2244.708,--My answer to it is that the difference is that in Whitley there is no question but what there was a serious deprivation of constitutional rights.
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2250.801,2255.673,Whitley just applies if the injury is more serious?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2255.673,2262.811,"--Well, I'm saying that Whitley itself had to do with a more serious injury, and I think that the difference--"
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.811,2270.044,"It did, but I don't find in the opinion an expression that it could only be applied when someone was shot."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2275.166,2297.781,"--If I recall Whitley, Your Honor, the Court... Your Honors held that there was the... clearly the... more than significant injury and they held that that injury however did not constitute a constitutional deprivation because of the absence of the subjective element."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.846,2490.969,"You don't... you don't deny, I suppose, that the officers intended to discipline this man?"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2490.969,2496.717,"I suppose that is a question of definition, Justice White."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.717,2506.37,"Well, do you think they expected to get him to obey or get him to do something, to... didn't they want to alter his conduct in some way?"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2506.37,2508.478,I really don't know.
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.61,2547.509,"Well, of course, I suppose if they intended to discipline him or affect his conduct some way or deter a repetition of his conduct, they would want to make sure that they did something to him besides inflict a frivolous injury... I mean, just a de minimis thing."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2548.945,2556.084,"--I suppose you could say so, but let us take for example--"
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.084,2560.283,So you think these people just enjoyed being cruel?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2560.283,2562.689,"--No, I am not saying that, Your Honor."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.591,2579.339,"Well, they certainly then intended to let him know how they felt--"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2579.339,2581.088,"--No question about that, I think, Your Honor."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.088,2587.477,--And you don't do that by just de minimis conduct.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2587.477,2589.305,Conceivably you could.
1991.90-6531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.834,2595.302,You are not saying this was de minimis.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2597.536,2598.332,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2633.068,2640.049,What if they beat him so that they broke his shoulder?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2644.064,2646.032,"In my opinion, clearly it would."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.032,2646.875,Why?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2646.875,2650.281,Because he had a significant injury.
1991.90-6531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.281,2658.104,"Yes, but supposing they'd beaten him and he had just stumbled after they hit him in the face or something and he broke his shoulder in the fall rather... they didn't try to break his shoulder."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2660.322,2664.352,"I think you then get into a question of causation, Justice Stevens--"
1991.90-6531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.352,2665.071,"Well, the causation is perfectly clear."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2670.225,2672.178,"--All right, in that case, I would say yes."
1991.90-6531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2672.178,2673.396,Yes what?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2673.396,2689.375,"Yes, that there is an Eighth Amendment violation because you have... once you establish a causation factor, whether it was intended that he should fall or whether the fall was the result of what they intended to do, that comes back to the basic legal--"
1991.90-6531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.375,2695.793,"See, in my hypothetical the broken shoulder is... to use Justice Scalia's approach is clearly not a part of the intended punishment."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2700.667,2709.273,--I think the legal principle is that you intend those consequences which would logically follow from your action.
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.593,2729.092,They did intend to beat him.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2729.092,2730.904,--Did they beat him?
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.904,2735.324,"I said they... well, you are stuck with the findings, I guess--"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2735.324,2736.309,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.309,2737.464,"--All right, let's be stuck with them."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2740.105,2741.088,I'm sure they did.
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.928,2757.643,Even if they intend to punish him for his conduct?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2757.643,2770.857,"--Yes, I think even so because I think that the objective test is not in any way affected by the intention of the person who is administering the beating."
1991.90-6531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.85,2791.77,All three of them got up on the wrong side of the bed.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2791.77,2794.488,"--All right, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2833.707,2858.119,"I take it then, if a significant injury as you would define it, were to be inflicted by an individual prison guard, contrary to prison policy and it is something that he himself could be disciplined for, you say that would be an violation of the Eighth Amendment... if there was a significant injury?"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2858.119,2862.569,"No, I don't say that, although it has led to that."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.804,2864.647,I thought you already had said that?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2864.647,2865.834,Because--
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.834,2871.598,"You're getting to a significant injury... certainly the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit would accept it, I suppose."
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2875.05,2883.295,"--You're getting to the other qualification of the court's question and that question was, a single incident of force."
1991.90-6531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.915,2941.241,Even if it was the warden of the prison that did it?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2941.241,2948.894,"I would have to say if the warden did it, that it would give you a different answer because there you have someone who sets policy."
1991.90-6531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.389,2962.185,"We know that one was a lieutenant, wasn't he?"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2962.185,2975.024,"Yes, the lieutenant, he was on the cell block with the two corrections officers, and the officer in charge of the camp was a major."
1991.90-6531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.424,2994.049,I don't see what difference the warden would make.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3002.793,3003.684,Let me say that I--
1991.90-6531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.684,3007.495,"So it wouldn't really matter if the Governor did it even, he can't repeal the State statute--"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3007.495,3029.518,"--I am completely comfortable with that suggestion, but the difficulty I have with it is that it then introduces the question of whether the statutory provisions are honored in the breach, and that the true policy of the State is that which is implemented by someone having authority."
1991.90-6531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3030.955,3032.033,--Like a lieutenant?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3032.033,3041.374,"--No, not a lieutenant, because lieutenant's are, if you will forgive my saying so, a dime a dozen in the prison hierarchy, just as they are in the Army."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.374,3041.825,We won't quote you.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3043.731,3045.901,"Having been one myself, I know--"
1991.90-6531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3045.901,3047.353,"Not to this lieutenant, anyway--"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3052.305,3054.6,"--Let's say, not all lieutenants are equal."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.803,3060.38,You were a lieutenant?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3060.38,3062.535,"I was a lieutenant, so I know whereof I speak."
1991.90-6531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.535,3065.44,In the prison or just in the Army?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3065.44,3067.003,Not in the prison; in the Army.
1991.90-6531,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3098.958,3108.781,"Do we have any kind of a finding below that the court of appeals didn't even address, that this isn't a single incident case?"
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3120.84,3121.62,--They went off on the significant injury.
1991.90-6531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.495,3126.447,--And didn't the magistrate find they also beat up the witness Allen?
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3126.447,3128.649,"That was his finding, yes, sir."
1991.90-6531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.649,3130.71,So it is not exactly a single incident.
1991.90-6531,1,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3130.71,3131.788,We are stuck with that.
1991.90-6531,2,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,3272.607,3274.278,"I have no rebuttal, Your Honor."
1991.90-6531,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.622,3277.37,Very well.
