1968.543,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,36.936,"Number 543, Glen A. Williams, et al., appellants versus James A. Rhodes et al."
1968.543,0,21724,david_j_young,,46.202,53.532,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, Mr. Lopeman, may it please the Court."
1968.543,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,61.298,62.155,Very well counsel.
1968.543,0,21724,david_j_young,,65.764,91.54,"First of all, the appellants would like to express their appreciation to the Court for the dispatch and vigilance with which they have scheduled this case, the case that may very well need additional remedial relief to protect the most basic of all of our rights in society, the right to vote."
1968.543,1,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,3459.947,3464.079,"Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Justices of the Court, may it please the Court."
1968.543,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3507.088,3507.83,1967?
1968.543,1,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,3507.83,3516.545,"Yes, and this is required by the District Court's opinion at page 16."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6396.746,6399.622,I'm an attorney not a politician and Marvin Griffin's name should appear in the ballot.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6399.622,6401.558,"Well, no, no."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6419.541,6419.641,That's correct.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6419.641,6433.593,"And may I suggest to you therefore that I want to know, who is the candidate for the Office of Vice President of the United States of the American Independent Party in Ohio?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6433.593,6441.723,I will answer you that we are perfectly satisfied with the order of Justice Stewart placing on the ballot the names that appeared in this order.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6444.105,6461.094,"I understand that but I'm asking you whether he is the candidate of the American Independent Party and if he is, if your answer to that is yes, then I want to know two things; does the record show how he was selected, number one."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6481.801,6489.579,I think I can answer that by staring at the back that Ohio has no requirement that the electors vote for a person to whom they're pledged.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6489.579,6498.217,Now you and your adversary just arrived diametrically opposite conclusions on that question?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6498.217,6502.209,My adversary said he wasn't aware of any statute until someone just told him today.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6502.209,6503.454,And someone was his --
1968.543,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6503.454,6504.156,"That disapprove that, --"
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6504.156,6504.365,--co-counsel?
1968.543,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6504.365,6506.084,-- was not?
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6506.084,6506.611,Wasn't it?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6506.611,6516.132,"If there is one, I'd like to see it cited because I've never been able to find it and I asked to his co-counsel during argument to send me over the statutory provision because I don't know the one exist."
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6516.132,6521.358,"Alright, now, next -- may I get to my next question if you care to."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6552.283,6556.035,Governor Wallace under those circumstances has announced his position.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6557.754,6561.241,"I'm asking a question of law, I'm not interested in the politics in this --"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6561.241,6564.947,"Well, then I can't, -- but you are asking me -- I beg your pardon."
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6568.115,6570.561,"Well, I'm asking you, what the legal effect will be."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6578.437,6578.615,No.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6578.615,6579.698,Or will they not?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6579.698,6581.901,"We do not think that would be the legal effect, no."
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6581.901,6591.594,"And you're saying that legally they will be free to vote, to cast their vote for someone else --"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6591.594,6591.629,Yes.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6591.629,6593.594,-- as vice president?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6593.594,6594.265,Yes.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6594.265,6604.608,"Now, is Mr. Griffin, the candidate in whatever sense you want to put it at the present time of the American Independent Party of Ohio."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6604.608,6605.866,"Now, if you allow me this to --"
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6605.866,6607.415,In any sense whatever.
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6607.415,6612.655,If you allow me to repeat what I have read in the papers I'll be glad to tell you that.
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6626.309,6634.121,Mr. Griffin originally selected before you started it lawful?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6634.121,6649.394,"The petitioners who signed this petition of 450,000 people gave to the three men who are named in the petition, the authority to call a state convention or in the absence of a state convention to make the selection."
1968.543,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6696.015,6698.667,Are they obliged to vote for Wallace?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6698.667,6699.507,No.
1968.543,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6699.507,6705.221,They can vote for Mr. “x” and Mr. Griffin if they wanted?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6705.221,6707.634,This is as a matter of law I find no --
1968.543,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6707.634,6708.332,As a matter of law --
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6708.332,6708.348,Yes.
1968.543,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6708.348,6709.209,-- that's what we're talking about?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6709.209,6713.252,"Yes, I think they're free to vote for whomever they please in Ohio."
1968.543,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6802.095,6805.726,"Yes, but you're not -- for a moment suggesting that that's a reversal, are you?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6805.726,6806.194,Oh!
1968.543,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6807.627,6820.949,You mean it's your understanding it certainly my understanding that the state could with equal convenience and he is complied with an order which would in fact affirm the action of the District Court?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6820.949,6839.902,There're no -- you made that perfectly clearly to us and the order does that this Court is free to order Governor Wallace off the ballot but what I'm saying is that all steps have been taken and if no other order for example of this Court were rendered he would be on the ballot in the November 1968 Presidential Election.
1968.543,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6867.287,6869.466,Was that as a party or just a candidate?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6869.466,6870.831,"Independent candidate, yes."
1968.543,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6870.831,6871.713,Independent candidate?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6871.713,6873.637,Yes.
1968.543,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6874.617,6875.64,Yes.
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6876.563,6882.463,"Pre-1948, sixty days before the election with 1% of the signatures someone could get on the ballot."
1968.543,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6882.463,6883.265,As a candidate?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6883.265,6884.903,"That's correct, yes."
1968.543,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6895.186,6907.793,"The laws and actually after 1948 simply limited independent candidates, they didn't really affect the laws applicable to parties, do they?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6907.793,6909.61,That's -- except to the indirect --
1968.543,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6909.61,6916.839,"If that was I know that you could no longer be an independent, the only way you could be a candidate on a ballot would be through the party machinery?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,6916.839,6929.331,"Yes, before 1948, all of the parties used the independent nominating petition technique because that provided that even though you were technically an independent candidate you'd put a label."
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6994.339,6996.407,I'm not sure I understand you.
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7004.118,7009.005,"Because there are two questions before the Court, the matter of temporary relief and ultimate relief."
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7028.307,7050.698,"Well, do you mean to say that if we rule on the merits here and your opinion will be deciding something about the -- well, will have to be deciding constitutionality of the Ohio statute as applied in this case or generally in either event, wouldn't we?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7050.698,7051.624,"Yes, yes as --"
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7051.624,7071.734,"And what you're saying is that one would be an interim order and the other would be a final order but we would not in any case be adjudicating whether there is such a thing as the American Independent Party as a formal Ohio party under Ohio laws for future purposes, is that right?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7071.734,7081.099,I don't think it's necessary for the Court to make that adjudication because even the name appearing on the ballot as it does now with the label would be much the same as the old technique that we used in Ohio.
1968.543,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7081.099,7092.793,What would you think if this was -- if today were the last day the Court could decide this case and still get the name off the ballot if it decided against your position?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7111.286,7114.714,I probably go way please it with the temporary relief that we've received.
1968.543,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7114.714,7117.628,"Uh-huh, I thought you would be."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7124.297,7125.138,"Well, --"
1968.543,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7125.138,7129.055,"Because it could be you know that we might not be able to decide this case and we, who knows."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7129.055,7137.674,Here's the situation you have before you is that the lower court all three judges of the federal district court below found Ohio's laws were unconstitutional.
1968.543,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7145.179,7153.385,"But you said you've waited too long, they didn't want to -- they said among other things they said laches among other things, didn't they?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7153.385,7156.672,They did say that but they also declared these laws to be unconstitutional.
1968.543,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7171.539,7178.727,"Well, I know but that assumes that they got some rights, that's the question you've got here (Voice Overlap)."
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7178.727,7189.962,"The District Court did decide that that they have rights, that they had equal protection rights and that the State of Ohio has violated the equal protection law of cause when it denied ballot position to independent third party candidates."
1968.543,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7189.962,7198.915,I know but that's either their decisions been appealed up here and I just and let's assume there's no enough time to decide it.
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7198.915,7203.57,I just have a strong belief that this Court will decide rights do exists under these circumstances.
1968.543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7215.966,7217.944,Mr. Chief Justice may I ask --
1968.543,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7217.944,7218.063,"Yes, certainly."
1968.543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7218.063,7224.883,-- if they has the citation to any Ohio statute that binds the electors to the names --
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7224.883,7227.384,"No, Your Honor because we do not have this."
1968.543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7227.384,7230.715,"Well, didn't you tell us earlier that there was such a statute?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7230.715,7234.632,I was told by my co-counsel that he believe there was.
1968.543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7257.918,7261.153,"So that would not apply here in this instance, in this situation?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7261.153,7262.016,That's correct.
1968.543,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7262.016,7263.951,Then there is no statute?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7263.951,7270.873,"I don't believe there is now, I'm going back and forth but this is my understanding knowing everything that I know about it."
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7270.873,7277.552,"Well, these people, the American Independent Party will have to certify at least some electors, won't it?"
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7283.077,7284.153,"Yes, Your Honor if this --"
1968.543,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7284.153,7295.059,And then will those electors have to take the same oath as the electors selected pursuant to file the democratic or republican parties?
1968.543,2,21724,david_j_young,,7295.059,7300.782,I would think that it would be up to the order of this Court; I don't know what it is.
1968.543,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7321.217,7388.902,"Very well, number 544, Socialist Labor Party et al., appellants versus James A. Rhodes, et al."
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7402.249,7402.699,Thank you Your Honor.
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7402.699,7409.532,-- you may proceed.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7409.532,7428.104,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, this is the companion action in the case below the appellants were plaintiffs in the District Court in the Southern District of Ohio, they are the Socialist Labor Party of America and its Ohio members."
1968.543,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7542.884,7569.289,"Excuse me Mr. Gordon, I gather we have the practical problem here that your client is not beneficiary of the interim relief of the appellants in the previous case received so that what is the situation if you would've prevail, what is -- are there any opportunity as I understand the previous argument probably there isn't to get you on the ballot now?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7569.289,7570.94,"We take issue with that position, Your Honor."
1968.543,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7573.217,7584.759,"I know, I say the practical finding is that you are not on these ballots which we are advised, they have now been prepared that have the American Independent Party name."
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7587.266,7587.728,That's correct.
1968.543,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7587.728,7597.9,And there is a practical problem of how before election there can be printed if you prevail and distributed the ballots with the name of your party -- your client on it.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7597.9,7598.317,That's right.
1968.543,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7598.317,7599.654,Don't we have that problem?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7599.654,7610.817,We have that problem but it's out position that there is more than ample opportunity to print ballots or if it's necessary to reprint ballots which in our judgment will conform to the imperatives of the Fourteenth Amendment and its Equal Protection Clause.
1968.543,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7610.817,7621.513,"Well, now what as a practical matter, what support do you have for the statement that there's ample of time now to print ballots with name of the Socialist Labor Party on it?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7621.513,7628.552,"Well, for one thing and counsel on both sides have to rely in representations to the Court that is what we do."
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7671.28,7674.323,Can you print and program machines in 29 days?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7674.323,7679.327,We would concede that there will be a great practical problem as far as programming machines.
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7680.351,7685.592,"Well, how many -- what percent of the voters in the State of Ohio are going to vote on machine?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7685.592,7688.288,"Well, Your Honor it varies widely in Franklin County all the --"
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7688.288,7689.928,All for the whole state?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7689.928,7691.908,"Well, we have 88 different systems."
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7692.731,7696.642,"Well, what percentage of all the voters in Ohio are going to vote through machines one way or another?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7696.642,7697.763,"Well, I'm unable to say --"
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7697.763,7699.083,75%?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7699.083,7703.304,"Well, in Cuyahoga County it's much less than, in Franklin County it's all."
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7735.708,7738.29,When was the candidate selected?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7738.29,7739.857,When were the candidates selected?
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7739.857,7740.331,"Yes, sir."
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7740.331,7746.904,The candidates were selected by the Socialist Labor Party its national candidates at it's convention in May of this year.
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7746.904,7751.28,"So, you couldn't have complied with the February rule, could you?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7751.28,7761.64,"Well, no Your Honor although I don't think that rule by itself precludes -- I was getting on the ballots because the other parties didn't nominate their candidates until August."
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7761.64,7765.13,Who was your candidate four years ago?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7765.13,7767.957,Who was the candidate of the Socialist Labor Party for president four years ago?
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7767.957,7770.559,Uh-huh.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7770.559,7770.952,I'm not --
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7770.952,7775.098,"While you're answering that, the next question is why didn't raise the question then?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7775.098,7778.764,"Well, let me go to the next question because I'm not sure who the candidates of the party were."
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7833.111,7836.629,"Well, do you say party has only 108 voters?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7836.629,7841.933,It has -- the party shows a membership of 108 in Ohio as of 1966.
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7841.933,7846.949,Aren't the many county states have more than 108 counties?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7846.949,7847.753,I'm sorry I didn't understand.
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7847.753,7851.754,Aren't the many states that have more counties of 108?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7851.754,7852.761,More candidates?
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7852.761,7853.495,Counties?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7853.495,7854.465,Counties?
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7854.465,7854.87,Yes.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7854.87,7860.798,I suppose there are but there's many states where a party of 108 it has no difficulty whatever in getting on the ballot.
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7863.621,7879.588,You say this -- is it your position federal constitution bars the state for admitting the group has only 108 members going to the trouble and expense of putting them on the ticket in every county in the state?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7879.588,7880.495,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7909.523,7926.003,"Did I understand that your position is exact opposite -- your position is exact opposite of the state it takes the position they have an absolute right to bar for any reason at all, a minority party."
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7934.962,7935.542,"Well, no Your Honor."
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7943.7,7946.57,"You can't take the one of those, can you?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7946.57,7952.067,"It's hard for me to, Your Honor, because we've examined the reasons that have historically been offered and we (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7952.067,7959.743,So you really are as Mr. Justice Black suggests the claim very -- come very close to claim in absolute right to be on the ballot?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7959.743,7961.368,The party is on -- the small political party --
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7961.368,7962.078,"Right, yes."
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7962.078,7964.03,That's essentially that's right.
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7982.408,7984.911,Suppose if there's only five members?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7984.911,7988.326,"Well, we have suggested the guideline."
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7994.341,7996.311,Why should there be any if you have an absolute right?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,7996.311,8000.452,We really don't think there should be any until it's proven that a problem has been created.
1968.543,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8022.359,8028.64,"Mr. Gordon, we are all throwing around the word “rights” around here -- rights, rights."
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8048.363,8049.335,"Alright, Your Honor --"
1968.543,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8049.335,8053.072,Because I presume you're talking about some asserted constitutional right --
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8053.072,8053.131,That's correct.
1968.543,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8053.131,8055.616,"-- federal constitutional right, from where?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8055.616,8061.958,We based our rights on a number of sections of the Constitution but primarily on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8155.109,8157.309,Is that exactly what you have?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8171.678,8184.175,"Your Honor, I'm only using Judge Kinneary's language, he said himself that its language in his opinion he said that denying Wallace a position on the ballot would be treating the citizens like second class electors and denying them equality of opportunity."
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8184.175,8186.307,But he's not the one we --
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8186.307,8186.695,"Alright, --"
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8186.695,8187.212,-- construe?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8187.212,8190.886,"But we agree with that, we agree, we think both parties should be on the ballot."
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8211.389,8217.597,Where did the political party get the “right” on this Court to be on the ballot?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8217.597,8221.762,It gets its -- it derives its right from the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8230.606,8240.383,"Well, now you say its one and a half of 1%, the states has its 15% you got a half to bid him for us?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8240.383,8243.861,"Yes, the proposal that we have made is one-tenth of 1% with the maximum of (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8243.861,8245.554,"Well, I've said, you say that --"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8245.554,8245.571,Yes.
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8245.571,8247.856,-- state has 15%.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8249.641,8250.866,"No, Your Honor because the happy medium --"
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8250.866,8252.764,"Because you wouldn't qualify, right?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8252.764,8254.161,That's correct.
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8254.161,8259.272,And that's the reason you want this one figured it just fits you like a glove?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8259.272,8268.654,"No Your Honor, we're suggesting that as a sealing on this basis that there is no justification, there is no compelling necessity to keep a small party off."
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8270.402,8277.054,"But would escape the right and limit in the ballot to 100 people, don't you think that was good?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8277.054,8278.546,"I would say this Your Honor, that problem --"
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8278.546,8279.795,Would that be good?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8279.795,8281.058,"No, it would not be good."
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8282.852,8287.904,Do you think the state to have a ballot that would have a thousand people running for president?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8287.904,8288.528,If the --
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8288.528,8292.342,Would that be the state have a right to protect itself from that?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8292.342,8298.296,"Yes, it might if that happened but then if you come to this Court and say, well, look we have a legitimate problem here."
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8336.541,8339.994,Anytime may I ask the state court to correct this.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8339.994,8340.799,The state court?
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8342.163,8342.93,Why not?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8342.93,8353.829,"Because we have more faith in federal courts than in state courts to relief the type of problem that this party has faced, the obliteration of its rights."
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8354.591,8362.941,"Since (Inaudible) date till date, you have never asked the state, you say the state is wrong, you never asked the state to correct its own error."
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8362.941,8365.686,You mean state legislature or the state court?
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8365.686,8367.832,The state.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8367.832,8373.901,The state legislature is run by two political parties and to them the words “third party” are anathema.
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8380.982,8383.716,That's not true for the courts I'm sure.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8383.716,8393.405,It's -- the courts are much more detached but the federal courts we have much greater faith and their willingness to be guardians of the constitutional rights of third political parties.
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8394.617,8397.051,(Voice Overlap) and they didn't go under state court?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8397.051,8398.259,That's right Your Honor.
1968.543,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,8400.796,8403.04,And it took you 20 years to find that out?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8403.04,8403.967,"Well, no."
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8431.071,8432.939,Can they vote in Ohio?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8432.939,8434.912,They can vote in Ohio Your Honor.
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8439.482,8440.654,They have to write-in?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8440.654,8443.482,They have to write-in but there's all kind of problems with write-in voting.
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8443.735,8452.405,"Do you claim that the state doesn't have the right to say that such a small group, hundred, how many population in Ohio?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8452.405,8455.702,"Well, there's a vote in the election of about 3 million."
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8455.702,8465.606,About 3 million there's only a hundred that is treating them or denying them the equal protection not to put them on the ballot if you put all the others I'm talking about.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8465.606,8470.167,"Your Honor, of the Socialist Labor Party with that small membership is -- was on the ballot for 75 years --"
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8470.167,8472.365,I'm not talking about having been on the ballot.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8472.365,8486.35,"Yes, we say that the State of Ohio cannot deny anybody its rights to be on the ballot unless it shows the compelling justification and that is the doctrine in all other phases of voting right cases that in order to impair when we talk about the segregation system --"
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8486.35,8508.605,"Well, except the general provision of the Equal Protection Clause has to be treated some way practically, we cannot construe it because it's never been construed which means each particular class has to have exact the same treatment under all of circumstances but you do claim that application here."
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8508.605,8518.56,"No, we do think there has to be a practical application but the question is what is that practical application for the State of Washington a hundred people can meet on a convention and the party is on the ballot."
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8553.1,8562.571,"Well, do you have to -- do you rest on that extreme position and used that without (Inaudible), do you rest on that?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8603.309,8604.883,"That is our position Your Honor, yes."
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8604.883,8615.443,"Well, do you have to take the extreme position for which you've been arguing or do you reach the same result by law in the lines that I've just suggested to you?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8615.443,8630.476,"Your Honor, to be perfectly candid well, the question of placing the party on the ballot is central at the same time our transcendent concern is this, what you referred to is an extreme position is the position which we feel ought to be urged upon the states."
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8637.779,8674.018,"I understand that -- excuse me sir, I'm just -- I'm trying to -- what I'm trying to get from is your view as to this point, suppose that we don't go along with the -- what I've called the extreme position, suppose that we take the position however that lower court was right in saying that the Ohio law is unconstitutional because although Ohio could make reasonable regulations and set up reasonable classifications, these are not reasonable, do you see?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8674.018,8675.004,"Yes, I understand that."
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8675.004,8685.463,"Now, would that -- would it or would it not, or would that or would it not suffice for your purposes?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8685.463,8699.815,"It would suffice for our purposes for the 1968 Elections because we would then argue as follows that in the absence of any restrictions constitutionally viable restriction imposed by the state, the Court has no right to set up its own and to keep a political party off."
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8704.969,8706.613,"Alright, that's what I'm trying to get --"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8706.613,8706.694,Yes.
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8706.694,8730.448,"-- and in other words, your position would be that since by my assumption the statutes unconstitutional this Court should not then say that 100 members of the political party is not enough but we should then say that in all of parties before us are entitled to relief, is that your argument?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8730.448,8732.028,"That's correct Your Honor, yes."
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8767.827,8774.351,"Elector could -- these days, the right to choose the electors?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8774.351,8779.61,"Well, we're referring to the percentage of signatures that it might require."
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8788.755,8795.748,"Well, you don't think that legislature could permit the choice we make between A and B, and between A, B, C, and D?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8795.748,8808.574,"No, we do not, we think that all parties have to share and that if any are going to be kept off it's going to be on a reasonable basis in compelling necessity has to be shown which it never has been shown with respect to small third parties."
1968.543,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8898.273,8902.513,At clear where you get these guidelines from the District Court's --
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8902.513,8912.718,"The District Court's decision based upon Wesberry case, Reynolds versus Sims, this language flows from these cases."
1968.543,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8920.396,8926.858,"No, you know Wesberry against Sanders, Reynolds against Sims have nothing to do with parties on the ballot?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8926.858,8929.138,"No, it did not but it had to do with voting rights."
1968.543,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8929.138,8931.76,And had nothing to do with the Electoral College?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8931.76,8945.169,"No, it's a different but it's in the area of voting rights and it says in voting rights whenever there's any impairment or infringement it cannot be constitutionally warranted unless necessity is shown."
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8982.056,8989.653,"Mr. Gordon, forgive me for taking another moment of your time but did you represent to us that Cuyahoga County that's Cleveland, isn't it?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,8989.653,8990.734,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8990.734,9000.606,Has printed ballot with the Socialist Party name on it and your candidates on its subject to this Court's decision?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9000.606,9000.659,"No, Your Honor --"
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9000.659,9001.796,Can you tell us that?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9001.796,9003.923,What they have done is reserved space --
1968.543,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9003.923,9004.526,I see.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9004.526,9015.76,"-- on, so that if this Court should decide to place the candidates on the ballot then it will be no particular problem in that county, the county is probably unique on the machine as well."
1968.543,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9015.76,9019.811,"(Inaudible) don't you think if they take the ballots, they have got them printed?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9019.811,9022.951,"They have got them printed yet, there's time."
1968.543,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9022.951,9024.369,We talk about time for printing.
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9037.052,9051.226,"Well, that's correct Your Honor and we have stated in our final brief filed with the Court that that the absentee ballots we may have arrived and pointed no return but the only part, the only ones that would be injured this Court should decide to put a Socialist Labor Party candidates on the ballot."
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9062.398,9063.546,How could you do that?
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9063.546,9076.031,"Well, the Secretary of State Your Honor has announced that Wallace's name is going to be on the absentee ballot and will stay on regardless of any future decision of this Court and by the same token if that's the case then the -- so another words, it's possible the ballots will be different."
1968.543,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9076.031,9084.348,"But they haven't waived it, are you claiming now the right to waive for other people aren't you or other people I understood to decide particular numbers of your party?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9084.348,9086.232,"Well, its just nothing can be done at this point."
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9095.892,9105.799,"I suppose there are hundreds of times as many members in the Armed Forces overseas so you have members to your party, aren't there?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9105.799,9106.208,"Well, --"
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9106.208,9116.957,"You must have thousands, many thousands of members of the Armed Forces overseas, are you going to deprive them of their vote or --"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9116.957,9122.193,"No, Your Honor, they would all have the right to vote for the Socialist Labor Party by the write-in."
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9122.193,9124.659,"Well, they got it now, didn't they?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9124.659,9127.824,They have that now -- they are going to use paper ballots.
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9140.766,9144.147,"Why can't all of the vote, vote with the same facility?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9144.147,9154.899,Because on many have to vote by virtue of voting machine and as we have shown in the -- and his counsel for Mr. Wallace has pointed out there's all kind of problems in casting a write-in vote in the voting machine.
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9176.505,9182.298,"Don't you have that same inequality in all write-ins, for all officers in your state --"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9182.298,9182.982,That's right.
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9182.982,9191.14,"-- there's a place there I suppose for write-in, for all officers and don't they have the exactly the same inequality?"
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9191.14,9200.749,"Well, there is that Your Honor and that's why a political party which consistently runs candidates should not be deprived of equal opportunity with the other parties."
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9237.325,9239.594,You may have five minutes more too (Voice Overlap) --
1968.543,3,30425,jerry_gordon,,9239.594,9240.097,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1968.543,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9240.097,9242.253,-- Mr. Gordon.
1968.543,4,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,9246.569,9250.356,May it please the Court.
1968.543,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9268.422,9270.63,It was not raised at all in the court below?
1968.543,4,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,9270.63,9271.889,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.543,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9277.291,9284.417,"Well, Mr. Lopeman, didn't the court below treat it though as a case for that relief you sought?"
1968.543,4,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,9284.417,9297.177,"No, Your Honor, the court below treated the cases, the Williams' case and this case together for decision but the cases have maintained a separate identity."
1968.543,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9297.177,9310.276,"No, my question was, I have read that opinion somewhere but I thought that the court below treated the application of the Socialist Labor Party as also asking for ballot position, am I wrong about that?"
1968.543,4,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,9310.276,9312.494,"I think Your Honor, yes Your Honor."
1968.543,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9318.319,9323.283,"But you may be right, I somehow read that opinion."
1968.543,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9323.283,9334.951,"Mr. Lopeman, I want into this pretty carefully some time ago and I would agree with you at the extent that it's rather ambiguous as to what they asked."
1968.543,4,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,9366.472,9368.507,"Yes, if I may clarify Your Honor the --"
1968.543,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9368.507,9369.822,It's not a condition?
1968.543,4,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,9369.822,9390.551,"-- the prayer requested the legislature to act and if the Court did not act and if the legislation does not act, they asked the Court to declare that Section 3517.01 of the Revised Code which requires which contains the 15% requirement be held invalid."
1968.543,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9404.014,9407.105,And how about the practical problem Mr. Lopeman?
1968.543,4,19482,charles_s_lopeman,,9407.105,9415.845,"As a practical matter, it is impossible at this time to -- for the State of Ohio to comply with an order granting the requested relief."
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,9773.463,9775.243,May it please the Court.
1968.543,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9804.858,9806.535,"Well, this Court didn't give them the right to women?"
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,9806.535,9806.649,Oh!
1968.543,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9811.113,9814.676,"Part of this Court gave Negroes the right to vote, that's in the Fifteenth Amendment?"
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,9814.676,9824.845,"Well, because so there are many other cases such as Louisiana versus United States where the right was circumscribed by the way it was implemented by the actions of local boards of elections."
1968.543,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10044.036,10065.236,"Mr. Gordon, what do you say to the representation -- professional representation by the representative of the Attorney General of Ohio that it's now a simple impossibility to give you the relief that you asked for 1968 and I'm not now talking about your laches perhaps it's all my fault but we're dealing with the fact not a theory as he represents it us, what do you say on that?"
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10065.236,10066.324,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.543,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10113.313,10114.775,Did they which is --
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10114.775,10116.275,Yes.
1968.543,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10116.275,10125.628,"-- at the very least then, you would require these counties that have -- that vote by voting machines to turn by -- to turn the paper ballots to satisfy, you really if you ask, is that --"
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10125.628,10128.27,We would say if that's what's necessary it should be not.
1968.543,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10153.136,10155.291,For a total disruption of the electoral process and all?
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10155.291,10156.593,No.
1968.543,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10167.199,10174.231,"It still represented to us professionally as a fact that there is not time, that it's impossible to do."
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10174.231,10185.168,"Well, I would hope the Court would take judicial notice of the fact that there is time to print ballots in 29 days to print paper ballots in the State of Ohio."
1968.543,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10185.168,10187.509,To get them over to get them?
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10187.509,10189.338,"No, Your Honor, not the absentee ballots."
1968.543,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10189.338,10193.344,Or get them back in time to be counted as absentee ballots?
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10193.344,10198.426,"No, because the absentee ballots should go out as they are, there is just not time on those."
1968.543,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10198.531,10210.857,And then all these thousands of veterans would be disfranchised in the situation unless they've followed another procedure from the one that's in the existence in Ohio?
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10210.857,10212.626,Unless they could write-in.
1968.543,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10222.476,10223.428,Yes.
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10260.651,10286.294,"Your Honor, we will only win this case if this Court take steps to preclude a recurrence of the experience that we have had in Ohio where the rights of these party were obliterated only if guidelines are established that will prevent, that will establish ceilings on the Ohio legislature because otherwise it's just as inevitable as it is that day follows the night, we will be back in Court in 1969 again challenging the new statutes which they passed."
1968.543,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10286.294,10315.747,"And that is no matter how late you come to this Court you had 20 years that you could've test to this if you wanted to as a national party because you have been a national party for 20 years but you think that regardless of the exigencies of the situation that you can come in just as late as you want and without regard to the disruption of the election process you can say to us in order to do your duty, you have to give us temporary relief."
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10315.747,10321.672,We say this Your Honor that the temporary relief was granted to the Wallace group on September 10.
1968.543,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10331.767,10336.741,"But that isn't final, we didn't say that that was going to be on that."
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10342.017,10347.152,That's correct Your Honor but the point is that there is still time and this we think is the crucial question.
1968.543,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,10391.761,10408.684,"Mr. Gordon, if you had filed this case on exact same time in 1964 and this Court had decided exactly what the Chief Justice suggests here you wouldn't be here today, would you?"
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10408.684,10410.471,"Well, that's correct Your Honor but we have to take --"
1968.543,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,10410.471,10414.851,"Well, isn't it that simple, you waited around."
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10414.851,10416.278,"Well, the party didn't wait around."
1968.543,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,10435.309,10438.367,(Inaudible)
1968.543,5,30425,jerry_gordon,,10438.367,10441.057,That's right and there was admittedly some delay.
