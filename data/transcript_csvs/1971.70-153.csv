1971.70-153,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.643,"We’ll hear arguments next in Number 70-153, United States against the District Court and others."
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,33.103,36.236,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-153,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,57.396,59.122,Would you raise your voice a little Mr. Mardian.
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,59.122,62.547,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,239.727,243.497,"Periodic review by whom, the Attorney General or the Director of the FBI?"
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,243.497,244.214,"Pardon me, sir, I didn’t --"
1971.70-153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.214,246.763,You said it was subject to periodic review and by whom?
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,246.763,248.542,By the Attorney General of the United States.
1971.70-153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,248.542,249.418,By the Attorney General.
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,249.418,250.321,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-153,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,250.321,264.418,"Now is this surveillance, this pattern of surveillance traceable back to the directive which President Roosevelt gave to Attorney General Jackson in this area?"
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,264.418,269.197,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-153,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,278.462,281.33,Is that memorandum in the record?
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,281.33,282.472,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-153,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,282.472,283.959,Of President Roosevelt?
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,283.959,284.835,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-153,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,284.835,287.649,Are the other memorandum in there since then?
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,287.649,289.322,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-153,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,289.322,290.623,That’s all here?
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,290.623,294.234,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,758.139,766.369,Does the Congress of the United States has a great deal of constitutional authority in the area of internal security and domestic affairs.
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,775.528,789.826,"The Congress has undoubted authority in the area of national security, I think you, as pointed out in the amicus brief filed by the National Lawyers Guild and the Black Panther Party in Article 1 Section 15."
1971.70-153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,845.445,864.241,"Well, my question is, was direct to this, is it your contention that only the President has this power through the appropriate cabinet officer or would the Congress not also have at least equivalent power in this area, if you’re right?"
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,864.241,865.223,"I would agree, Your Honor."
1971.70-153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.613,874.781,And broad investigative powers that’s been held many times?
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,874.781,880.701,"Yes, in fashioning a rule of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment."
1971.70-153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,880.701,898.656,"And I mean, I’m not -- I mean that if you’re right that the executive, the Chief Executive can do this through his designated agent cabinet officer, why couldn’t Congress equally do this investigating surveillance throughout the country through its designated agent?"
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,898.656,904.152,I think this type of activity Your Honor is peculiarly within the executive function.
1971.70-153,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,904.444,909.01,"Under the Constitution, you think it's entrusted exclusively to the President?"
1971.70-153,0,39914,robert_c_mardian,,909.01,913.63,"I would not wish to state at this argument, Your Honor."
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,2628.466,2633.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2769.411,2777.508,"Of course, during a great deal of that period Mr. Gossett, that was the regime of Amsted and of Goldman, was it not?"
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,2777.508,2778.039,Yes sir.
1971.70-153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2778.039,2788.845,So that the problem was not a Fourth Amendment problem during the line of share -- that period or great deal of that period and in effect to -- what was involved was a provision of the Federal Communications Act.
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,2788.845,2788.978,Yes.
1971.70-153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2788.978,2790.226,"Not the Fourth Amendment, am I wrong about that."
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,2790.226,2819.115,"Which -- you’re quite right Mr. Justice Stewart and the -- under the interpretation of that Act by the Attorney General, the proscription was against disclosure and all the Attorney Generals admitted that the disclosure point that they could not disclose and if they disclosed the fruits, there was a violation of the Act."
1971.70-153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2950.768,2961.892,"What use, Mr. Gossett, is the Government now undertaking to make of theses disclosures, if any?"
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,2961.892,2985.497,"The Government claims in this case that the -- and claims that in all cases of national security Mr. Chief Justice, that the fruits of wiretaps secured in connection with so-called intelligence information gathering should be admissible of evidence in a criminal case, that’s our position."
1971.70-153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3472.649,3475.518,I have not found you yet Mr. Gossett.
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,3475.518,3484.863,"The -- it’s the main brief of the Government, page 30 and the footnote, last paragraph of the footnote beginning on page 30, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3549.004,3556.306,I suppose there’s a risk Mr. Gossett in getting in -- tying ourselves down this semantics here.
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,3566.554,3601.68,"Well, I think that it would then depend on the facts and circumstances and I think that’s the very purpose of the warrant requirement to set up those facts and circumstances, have counsel explain to the Court what the significance with other relations as where and have the Court perform its constitutional role to determine whether the -- an intrusion is proper, what to do extent of the intrusion and so on, all the requirements whether they're probable cause for the intrusion."
1971.70-153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3601.68,3610.945,"Well, that would mean probably if they were going to have surveillance of an embassy they would have to do the same thing in their view, is that correct?"
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,3610.945,3619.521,This Court has reserved expressly the matter of the power of the President in the foreign field.
1971.70-153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3804.793,3822.435,"Mr. Gossett, suppose a foreign power, hostile foreign power or unfriendly foreign power engages, hires, employs people who lived here whether citizens or not and they engaged in this type of activity."
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,3831.913,3837.541,"I think if they were employed by the foreigners, they might be part of a foreign operation."
1971.70-153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3839.028,3843.037,Then they’d fall under the first part of the statute?
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,3843.037,3844.205,I think so.
1971.70-153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3873.781,3875.241,You’re still on 28?
1971.70-153,1,44772,william_t_gossett,,3875.241,3877.471,I'm still on the Appendix.
1971.70-153,2,16337,arthur_kinoy,,4512.186,4517.151,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1971.70-153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6404.198,6405.472,"Thank you, Mr. Kinoy."
1971.70-153,3,39914,robert_c_mardian,,6408.207,6408.765,Mr. Chief Justice and may it --
1971.70-153,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6408.765,6412.084,"If you need it, we will enlarge your time about two minutes."
1971.70-153,3,39914,robert_c_mardian,,6412.084,6412.349,Pardon me.
1971.70-153,3,39914,robert_c_mardian,,6415.589,6417.129,I don’t think I’ll need it.
1971.70-153,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6417.129,6419.041,You have 18 minutes.
1971.70-153,3,39914,robert_c_mardian,,6419.041,6420.581,"Yes, Sir."
