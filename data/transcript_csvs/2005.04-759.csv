2005.04-759,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.479,"We'll now hear argument, United States v. Olson."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,4.483,7.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,92.634,108.139,"Do I understand that you would accept the rule that if Arizona held a private inspector liable to third persons for their injuries, then the Government of the United States would be liable?"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,117.648,122.274,As long as Arizona applied that principle of liability to private persons in Arizona.
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,122.274,122.464,Yeah.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,122.464,123.537,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.156,146.544,"It gets ahead of the argument just a little bit, but you had a footnote about police officers."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,157.857,164.126,"--Well, those cases, as we know, do present, often, special circumstances not present in this case, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.626,180.531,"So, even with the police officer, I have to find a private analog."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,180.531,181.825,"Yes, you do."
2005.04-759,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,227.35,231.422,"Well, I mean, that's kind of a $64,000 question here."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,235.512,245.158,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we think it's often rare that there is no private person analog, given this Court's decision in Indian Towing, which stresses--"
2005.04-759,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,245.158,245.158,Right.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,245.158,247.533,--that one should look to a private person in like circumstances.
2005.04-759,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,256.231,269.822,"Isn't there always a private... I mean, we're talking about tort law... isn't there always a private analog, which is, you know, exercising reasonable care under the circumstances toward people to whom you owe some duty, and you just apply that general principle?"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,269.822,280.152,"--To the extent you're suggesting that we just look to general theories of tort law, I think that would be incorrect."
2005.04-759,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,316.309,329.136,"Well, all right, so if it's a police officer stopping somebody on a highway, it's the same as a private security guard stopping somebody at a... you know, the driveway at a plant or something."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,329.136,332.839,--That may be the closest private person analog.
2005.04-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,400.037,400.9,Can you back--
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,400.9,400.037,--care was.
2005.04-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.13,400.037,--up in Muniz a little bit?
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,409.363,420.618,"I think this Court suggested, in Muniz, that perhaps there could be private persons operating prisons, or one would look--"
2005.04-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.618,421.579,I don't recall--
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,421.579,421.742,--in that--
2005.04-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.742,422.453,--that in the decision.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,435.39,438.246,"--You may be right, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.915,464.104,Because in those days the Government was arguing it should be like State officials.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,464.104,479.129,"--For purposes of obtaining immunity, we were arguing that... which I think is a different argument than we're making here today... we were arguing that the Federal Tort Claims Act was not meant to waive our sovereign immunity at all with respect to certain types of governmental activities."
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.006,505.886,"May I ask you, what would you do if Arizona had a statute that said that any company that contracts privately to do mine inspections must obey the standards in the Federal guidelines?"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,507.683,512.087,"That presents a difficult question, Justice Stevens, as I'm sure you know."
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.306,519.897,But you say--
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,519.897,520.477,--address how you apply it here.
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,520.477,521.259,--and I think you're probably right--
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,521.259,521.432,If--
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.432,527.639,"--that you can't just make a Federal... implied Federal cause of action under the Federal standards, from what we know."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,532.202,550.306,"--If a State statute looked to Federal law as the source... I think one has to be careful when one talks about ""negligence per se"" type principles, which is what you're suggesting... some States look to statutes and regulations solely to establish a standard of care once a separate duty has been established."
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.971,598.026,"No, I'm assuming they just did it independently."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,607.474,623.312,"If they're just simply borrowing it, and don't feel compelled to borrow it, and are, indeed, applying it to private persons who perform safety inspections, then the United States could potentially be liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,628.216,632.889,"Well, but it seems to me that that's quite a foreseeable possibility."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,661.345,663.952,"--Well, I have several answers to that question, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,675.585,688.412,"Well, but I thought we said, at the outset... and correct me if I'm wrong... if Arizona imposes liability on private safety inspectors for injuries to third persons, then the United States would be liable here."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,688.412,690.579,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,691.903,692.104,That was the--
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,692.104,692.685,--under Justice--
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.685,693.035,--hypothetical.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,693.035,693.536,--Stevens' hypothetical.
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.338,802.759,"In your view... even though the Federal standard would not be controlling, in your view, if you applied a general reasonable person test, would the Federal standards be admissible so that the plaintiff could argue that there was a failure here which is evidence of negligence?"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,802.759,810.364,"In many States, one would look to Federal standards for setting the standard of care."
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.316,825.396,"When you say that it may be relevant, are you thinking of 2680(a)?"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,860.642,865.867,"Well, just to take your question, and then maybe clarify what you mean by what--"
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,865.867,866.24,Let me... let me--
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,866.24,866.461,--I can--
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,866.461,866.701,--ask it--
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,866.701,868.907,--I can... I can answer it the 26--
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,868.907,870.209,"--Look, I don't have to cross reference--"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,870.209,870.491,--Good.
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,870.491,871.312,--it to Justice Stevens.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,871.312,871.552,Okay.
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,871.552,876.205,Give me an example of the... of the function of 2680(a).
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,881.44,887.007,"Well, I think... obviously, you don't get to 2680(a) unless you've gotten through the first part and established--"
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.007,887.227,Right.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,887.227,892.181,--that there's some actionable duty on private persons in like circumstances and that we might be liable.
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.102,917.036,"Oh, I could... I could--"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,917.036,917.827,--take care of their patients once a day.
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,917.827,922.49,"--I could understand that if they... it would be an easier question for me if the statute said,"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,943.864,950.394,"Well, it can serve functions in other instances; for example, if someone alleges that you were following the statute, but the statute was invalid."
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,955.238,955.919,"So, it's really--"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,955.919,956.079,--is valid.
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,956.079,955.919,--the validity is the... is the nub of the provision.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,955.919,959.739,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,982.183,983.336,Of the Federal... I... okay.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,983.336,987.678,"--this could potentially provide a defense, even though, once you went through the first part of the statute--"
2005.04-759,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.678,1001.84,"I really don't understand the... are you sure that a failure to execute a statute does not come within the language, ""an act or omission"", in the execution of the statute?"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1008.179,1009.223,--I'm not sure I--
2005.04-759,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1009.223,1018.699,"You mean if you executed 90 percent and omit 10 percent of what you're supposed to do, it comes within that language, but if you don't execute at all, it doesn't?"
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1021.509,1025.882,"She's saying ""execution"" is not synonymous with ""performance"", which may well be correct."
2005.04-759,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.882,1027.497,"--Well, you--"
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1027.497,1028.218,I had assumed that--
2005.04-759,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.218,1030.122,"--you accepted, it seemed to me, the premise of--"
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1030.122,1030.252,--Yeah.
2005.04-759,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.252,1041.895,"--Justice Souter's question, which is that (a)... 2680(a) only applies to a failed execution."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1054.443,1058.656,--I must be missing the thread of the question somewhere.
2005.04-759,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.669,1059.669,I--
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1059.669,1060.44,--I was trying to make just--
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1060.44,1061.261,"No, but you've--"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1061.261,1061.802,"--a simple, modest point that--"
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1061.802,1063.278,--you've still answered my question.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1096.423,1097.225,--We may still have a defense in--
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1097.225,1097.425,Yeah.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1097.425,1097.806,--that situation.
2005.04-759,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1098.196,1098.357,Yeah.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1098.357,1098.767,--that's correct.
2005.04-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1099.621,1118.929,"There was an argument that was made in your brief, and I didn't fully grasp the thrust of it, in the... that is, you said that the Mine Safety and Health Administration has a duty to the Secretary of Labor, but not to the mine operator and not to the miner."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1131.406,1138.166,"--Well, I think that, in fact, would be an application of the Good Samaritan doctrine, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-759,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1228.967,1239.319,But you're not sure that the Good Samaritan is the... is necessarily what the Arizona law would be... what the analog would be.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1239.319,1246.92,"In our view, it's the only private person law that respondents argued to the ninth circuit."
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1330.337,1331.851,"Ms. Maynard, may I interrupt and just ask this?"
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1344.127,1347.215,"Not necessarily, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.352,1361.296,But I'm just wondering if you're not discussing a State law issue that has not been decided by either court below or really fully argued here.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1361.296,1372.26,"Well, it has not... the... whether or not there's an equivalency, whether or not private persons are liable in the same instances as State and governmental entities, was not argued by the respondents below."
2005.04-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.26,1372.26,Right.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1372.26,1374.135,"And, therefore, it was not decided."
2005.04-759,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1409.028,1409.028,"--Well, I wouldn't do that."
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1409.578,1409.028,--Texas statute.
2005.04-759,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1461.253,1463.391,It's just a background question.
2005.04-759,0,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1469.608,1472.246,I do not know whether they were actually sued.
2005.04-759,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1496.096,1497.26,"Thank you, Ms. Maynard."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1501.843,1503.335,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.04-759,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1568.81,1576.392,May I ask you a question that Justice Kennedy just brought up?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1590.215,1599.442,"Your Honor, Mr. Olson did collect, under the State workers' compensation statute, from the mine operator, that is correct, as did Mr. Vargas."
2005.04-759,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1654.716,1667.363,"But the... but the mine operator... the Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy under Arizona law, so the... nobody could get anything more from the mine operator."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1668.044,1669.188,That is correct.
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.147,1743.626,"Well, that goes to the remand question raised--"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1743.626,1743.786,It--
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.786,1744.107,--earlier.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1744.107,1743.786,--it does--
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.786,1747.908,It doesn't... it doesn't go to whether the ninth circuit was correct here.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1747.908,1771.978,"--Well, in a roundabout way, it does, Justice Scalia, because what happened was, the ninth circuit was faced with the task, under the Federal Tort Claim Act, of deciding whether... if the Federal Government... the Federal mine inspectors, if you would... were private people under like circumstances, would they be liable?"
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1825.706,1828.084,"Well, I mean, that might have... you might have won if they had said,"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1844.381,1844.532,That--

2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1855.475,1884.211,"--Well, Your Honor, what... our position is that, although they applied the law of municipalities and the State, what they were really doing is applying the Louie doctrine, which says that when you cannot identify a private actor, then the best evidence of what the State's law is, with respect to the actions of a party in the same circumstances, is to look at the State liability, and that--"
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.211,1885.133,That's a good question.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,1908.048,1915.362,"--Well, actually, I'm not aware of any private mine inspectors, but if we want to take that thought--"
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.362,1915.872,Maybe there are not--

2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.491,1974.777,"Mr. Cotter, I don't... I don't see, in the opinion, any indication that the ninth circuit was doing what you... what you assert it was trying to do... namely, to predict what future California law... locked deep in the bosom of the California Supreme Court, but not yet disclosed to the public... will hold."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2019.409,2023.671,"--Justice Scalia, I concede that the Court has accurately characterized the opinion."
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.031,2062.618,How long ago was that... was Louie decided?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2062.618,2065.456,"Your Honor, I believe it was about 20 years ago."
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.456,2071.953,"Twenty years ago. And Washington still has not yet made this prediction come true, I gather."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2071.953,2075.705,You mean it has not ruled on--
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.705,2076.376,Exactly.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2076.376,2076.726,--the subject?
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.726,2082.342,It has not extended its Government Tort Claims Act to private citizens.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2082.342,2090.625,I think... I think that the Federal Tort Claim Act does not apply to private citizens in Washington.
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.625,2094.706,"No, I'm saying the prediction that Louie made had not yet come true."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2100.504,2101.386,Would not do.
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.386,2102.629,--would be done.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2102.629,2106.078,Louie predicted that there would be no liability.
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.988,2112.107,"--Yeah, but Louie, according to the SG, says,"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2149.007,2153.833,If I understand Your Honor's--
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.833,2153.843,"Well, I'm just--"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2153.843,2154.294,--point--
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2154.294,2161.062,"--reading from their brief. What they say is, the court stressed that the equivalence is important."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2182.98,2188.616,"--And, in fact, Your Honor, the equivalence factor in Louie is present in this case."
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2188.616,2192.305,"Well, anyway, if Louie helps something other than that, it's wrong, too, isn't it?"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2195.416,2195.606,We--
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2195.606,2196.187,--private person.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2196.187,2202.484,"--The respondents concede that the question is ""private person under like circumstances""."
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.717,2220.468,But it didn't try to do that.
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2235.262,2245.605,In the... in the face of a district court opinion that applied the Good Samaritan statute and threw the case out because no allegation could be made to come within the Good Samaritan statute.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2249.455,2267.889,"Well, Justice Roberts, our contention is that the genesis of the doctrine that they applied, and that the fifth circuit applies, and that the D.C. circuit applies, is to predict State law, that its purpose is not to expand liability where State law doesn't exist."
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2298.258,2303.212,"But, doesn't that approach... it doesn't make any sense, because you're only looking at half of the equation."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2317.091,2340.159,"--Well, that issue was actually raised in the Hatchel case, in the D.C. circuit, where the... there was a highspeed chase and the officer caused a collision, and what happened was, the Government argued that you can't apply the standard applicable defined duty of the Government, but you can apply the Government... or the D.C. regulations as to standard of care."
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.167,2373.57,That's actually a rather interesting question I don't really know the answer to.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2404.95,2430.358,"Well, Your Honor, what I would say in this case is, the absolute wrong way to go about it is on a motion to dismiss, because, unfortunately, the record wasn't developed, which may, in fact, speak to issues that may, in fact, address Arizona law on Good Samaritan, for instance... the issue of whether, under Arizona law, a duty was assumed, the issue of whether reliance exists."
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2447.83,2462.162,"Well, doesn't that make it a contract case? If you're talking about the party who's contracted with, say, a private inspector... I mean, I have a contract, somebody comes and inspects the house for termites, and I assume, if they don't do a good job and the house is damaged, they're liable."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2465.453,2473.445,"--Well, if I may answer with a hypothetical, Your Honor, because we did not get to develop the record, what happened in this case is, the mine method changed."
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.137,2492.501,What--
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2492.501,2492.511,"""Why on Earth did""--"
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.511,2495.219,--What was your response to the motion to dismiss?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2504.897,2505.138,--Oh--
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.138,2507.685,--under State law in this... in this situation.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2507.685,2510.703,"--Justice Scalia, I did not understand the Government to be saying that--"
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.703,2511.525,"Oh, I... that's how I understood it."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2511.525,2513.271,"--and it is not true, if that was--"
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.271,2513.281,Okay.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2513.281,2513.872,--what they said.
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.872,2514.673,What was your response?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2514.673,2527.53,"Our response was that the law... first, our response was that, under the motion to dismiss, our factual allegations in the complaint have to be accepted, and we alleged all the elements of the Good Samaritan doctrine, and all the elements of the uniquely governmental--"
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2527.53,2527.86,You said that?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2532.303,2532.583,--Yes.
2005.04-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.583,2533.176,Okay.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2533.176,2554.389,"And what happened was, frankly, Judge Browning dismissed, relying, I think, on the... more on the discretionary function exception, and then the Myers case, out of the sixth circuit, saying, as a matter of law, this... as a matter of Federal law, MSHA is not an assumption of duty by the Government."
2005.04-759,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2582.803,2584.711,But we can remand for that.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2594.78,2596.997,"--Well, Your Honor, if the Court is--"
2005.04-759,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2596.997,2601.57,"So, we have to give some instructions as to how the... as to whether or not the ninth circuit is right about that."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2601.57,2602.483,--If the Court--
2005.04-759,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.483,2602.483,And that's why you're here.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2602.483,2621.31,"--if the Court is convinced that what the ninth circuit did was not try to predict what private law would... that... what private law in Arizona would be, if the Federal mine inspector was a private citizen, then we would concede that that's not the law."
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.616,2635.81,"See, that's exactly what's concerning me, and I don't quite see my way to an answer."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2669.138,2695.275,"--Your Honor, if you do decide to remand... which if the issue of the Good Samaritan doctrine or assumption of duty under Arizona law is going to be addressed, we recommend that there is a remand... we would urge the Court, as a matter of first... the first rule is to instruct the ninth circuit that these are badly... these are cases that are badly decided on motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim."
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2707.773,2710.772,"No, that's not... that's not what I've been asking."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2710.772,2711.002,And--
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2711.002,2726.217,"And to expose everything I was... perhaps the better thing is to say, ""There's always a private analogy"", or try very hard, because if you really found an instance there was no private analogy to, maybe there would be no recovery, because the statute simply speaks about private party."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2726.217,2729.256,"--With all due respect, Your Honor--"
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2729.256,2731.521,And this is a statute designed to give people recovery--
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2731.521,2731.521,--Sure.
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2731.521,2732.583,--when people commit torts.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2732.583,2734.618,It's a... it's a statute where... with a broad waiver intended.
2005.04-759,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2741.235,2742.086,It does.
2005.04-759,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.086,2746.247,"Yeah, it does, but that... would we end up there, because of the way the statute's written?"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2752.595,2754.622,"I concede that point, Your Honor."
2005.04-759,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2754.622,2756.536,"Okay, who's your... what's your best analog?"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2756.536,2766.105,"My best analogy here is a private mine inspector who has the same duties as a Federal mine inspector, which, in this case, who... you could say someone who contracted--"
2005.04-759,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2766.105,2766.966,Whom does he work for?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2788.341,2793.515,"--Well, earlier, the suggestion was made, ""What happens if the Government""... I thought the suggestion was,"
2005.04-759,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2796.966,2799.644,"No, but this... that's all hypothetical."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2806.011,2808.889,--The Arizona State mine inspector.
2005.04-759,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2810.293,2811.827,What's your second best analog?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2810.293,2819.731,"--Well, my second best analog, I guess, would be a workers' comp carrier, an insurer, or--"
2005.04-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2819.731,2826.591,"But I thought you had assumed that, under the Arizona law, you could rely on the Good Samaritan doctrine--"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2826.591,2828.537,--I believe we can rely--
2005.04-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2828.537,2832.228,"--And I thought that, at least, would be open on remand."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2832.228,2833.403,--I--
2005.04-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2833.403,2836.371,Is it necessary that we go further than that?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2836.371,2847.213,"--Well, I don't think it's necessary, if the Court doesn't want to address whether the Government always needs to... or the courts always need to find a private person."
2005.04-759,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2849.249,2853.291,"Aren't there, in all kinds of situations, private inspectors?"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2857.703,2857.703,--Sure.
2005.04-759,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.034,2857.703,Elevator operation inspector.
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2871.031,2877.894,"Well, in the restatement, section 324, under ""Assumption of a Duty"", gives an example."
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.216,2896.086,"Well, but only... presumably, only if they meet the requirements of the Good Samaritan law."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2896.086,2897.662,--I believe--
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2897.662,2913.237,"Which... they would have to show that there was an increase in the risk of harm, which I think it would not be true in your hypothetical, or that there was a duty owed to the third party... the scaffolding inspector is presumably hired by the contractor, not by the employees... or there was reliance."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2913.237,2920.921,"--I think that that's true, Your Honor, although I'd like to read a quote from Papastathis, which is... the court relied on."
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.7,2975.743,"So, we're just debating now whether or not you've satisfied the requirements of the Good Samaritan statute."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2975.743,2981.191,Or whether there are alternative theories of liability available under Arizona State law.
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2981.191,2986.617,"Did you argue... I mean, you lost in the district court on the Good Samaritan statute."
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2986.617,2986.947,Yes.
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2986.947,2988.283,"On your appeal, did you argue that that was wrong?"
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2988.283,2988.773,Yes.
2005.04-759,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2992.683,2997.828,But you said the district court went off on discretionary function?
2005.04-759,1,42557,thomas_g_cotter,,2997.828,3028.418,"It went off primarily under discretionary function, but then in addressing the Arizona... the Good Samaritan doctrine under Arizona, it relied on the Myers case, which is a case in which... the sixth circuit said that when you have the case... or safety inspections like the Federal... like MSHA, that court would adopt a actor, slash, monitor dichotomy so that there could never be an assumption of duty under... because the Government was only in a monitor function."
2005.04-759,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3072.019,3074.014,"Thank you, Mr. Cotter."
2005.04-759,2,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3076.702,3078.507,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-759,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3167.851,3170.409,You consider affidavits on a motion to dismiss?

2005.04-759,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3190.97,3191.711,But what--
2005.04-759,2,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3191.711,3192.484,--upon which they were relying.
2005.04-759,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3192.484,3198.591,--what argument do you have to avoid a remand for consideration of liability under the Good Samaritan law?
2005.04-759,2,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,3198.591,3204.75,"I think that's... that's one of our arguments, that they can't meet the Good Samaritan law--"
2005.04-759,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3204.75,3208.18,"But they didn't have a chance to argue that before the court of appeals, right?"
