1987.86-1108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,60.055,"Ms. Harritt, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,60.055,61.005,Thank you.
1987.86-1108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.213,165.938,"Ms. Harritt, does the record indicate whether either the Court or the probation officer told the Respondent the purpose of the interview?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,165.938,172.675,"No, the record doesn't indicate whether or not the Respondent was told by the Court or the probation officer."
1987.86-1108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.611,210.467,"Well, does the record indicate whether the public defender had notice of the time that interview would be given?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,210.467,217.288,"No, the record doesn't reveal notice as to the precise time when the interview would take place."
1987.86-1108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,239.153,241.769,"Ms. Harritt, do we know where Respondent is?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,241.769,244.371,"At this juncture, we do not, Your Honor."
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,244.371,249.073,"This is why we don't have any brief on his behalf, is that it?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,249.073,252.458,"Well, you have a brief on his behalf as filed by the--"
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,252.458,254.393,"I know, but there's no brief of his, is there?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,254.393,256.043,--I'm not--
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,256.043,260.047,"He had fully served his prison term, had he not?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,260.047,260.514,--Yes.
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,261.047,261.597,And he was released?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,261.597,262.499,"--Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,262.499,263.283,And now he's disappeared.
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,263.283,265.285,"Well, he's left the jurisdiction."
1987.86-1108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,265.285,268.653,"And he could be dead, couldn't he?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,270.37,271.688,"Well, we submit that the case--"
1987.86-1108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,271.688,272.138,A dead case.
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,272.138,275.406,"--Well, I would respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,297.054,301.958,"How can you get him back here if he served, fully served his prison sentence?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,303.926,309.397,"--The order of the lower court, Your Honor, indicates that he is to be re-sentenced."
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.497,315.467,"After he's fully served the sentence that was initially imposed, is that right?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,315.467,316.134,--That's correct.
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,316.134,318.253,And now they can bring him back for resentencing?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,318.253,336.297,"Well, that's because he might... if he is re-sentenced, he could face not just a lower sentence, but a deferred sentence which, if he were to satisfy the conditions of the deferred sentence, his conviction would be expunged, thereby avoiding any collateral consequences that attend conviction."
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,336.297,340.916,"But he's the one that has to initiate taking advantage of that option, doesn't he?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,340.916,350.605,"Well, the Court, lower court,... there is now a lower court order which mandates that there be resentencing in this case."
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,356.342,357.544,"Well, how are you going to return him?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,359.746,361.263,"Well, it's--"
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,361.263,362.632,If he's outside of the state?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,362.632,364.798,"--Well, it's in his interests to return."
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,364.798,365.484,Why is it?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,366.317,377.291,"Well, that's true, but I'm sure the Court would agree that if the conviction was expunged for these... if there was no record of these convictions, he would be put in a much better position."
1987.86-1108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,377.941,380.024,"Yes, but aren't you overlooking something?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,385.211,387.063,"--Well, that's an option."
1987.86-1108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.063,397.336,"Do you think a lawyer would advise him to come back, saying I realize you've served your sentence, but if you take a shot at getting the whole thing expunged, of course, you might have to spend another year in jail, but what do you want to do?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,406.125,417.849,"He certainly runs that risk, but our understanding of the mootness doctrine is... would have this Court rule on the merits of the case because there still is a controversy."
1987.86-1108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.688,430.14,"What benefit can you get out of winning this case, except an opinion that you would like?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,436.377,444.4,"Well, we would like the opportunity to have the case resolved, and we would like the sentence not vacated--"
1987.86-1108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,444.4,446.883,Will you ask for a more severe sentence if he comes back?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,446.883,450.719,"--Well, the Attorney General's office was not the prosecuting entity."
1987.86-1108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,452.253,454.505,"If you don't, you don't have any interest in the outcome of the case."
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,454.505,455.338,--What I'm--
1987.86-1108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.338,458.057,"You don't want to have to go about complying with the order, do you?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,458.057,459.173,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1987.86-1108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.173,460.992,"You're under an order, aren't you?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,460.992,461.559,Yes.
1987.86-1108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,461.559,463.444,"Well, you don't want to have to comply?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,468.979,471.531,"Well, if this Court were to--"
1987.86-1108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.531,472.665,Extradite him?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,474.05,477.335,"--Well, we might be able to obtain his whereabouts."
1987.86-1108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.335,478.519,"Is he on parole, by any chance?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,478.519,480.787,"No, he's not on parole, Your Honor."
1987.86-1108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.787,481.271,He's been released?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,481.271,482.073,Yes.
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,483.656,485.275,I still don't understand.
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,487.425,490.844,"--Well, if he were to return to the jurisdiction, he certainly would--"
1987.86-1108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,490.844,491.261,If he were.
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,493.178,494.796,"--Well, he runs--"
1987.86-1108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.796,497.182,You would have him committed to an insane asylum.
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,497.182,504.319,"--I would like to continue with the facts, if I may."
1987.86-1108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,556.621,559.489,Does the record show why she couldn't wait?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,559.489,562.322,"No, there is not a specific explanation given for that."
1987.86-1108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,562.322,563.691,"Wouldn't have taken very long, would it?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,563.691,566.808,"We don't know that, Your Honor."
1987.86-1108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,566.808,569.51,"Well, the investigator was on the way, wasn't he?"
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,569.51,575.831,"That's what was stated, but we, of course, don't know whether he would have arrived in ten minutes or in two hours."
1987.86-1108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,603.249,605.768,And you say that is not coercion of any kind?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,605.768,606.6,No.
1987.86-1108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,611.337,616.575,How would you feel if you were incarcerated and this was thrown at you?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,620.11,621.895,"Well, it's a choice."
1987.86-1108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,633.168,637.572,"Well, it certainly is a little different than the ordinary day-to-day decisions."
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,639.774,647.511,--We don't think that his situation as an incarcerated individual created any additional pressure or coercion.
1987.86-1108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,647.511,649.879,Just like you and I living outside?
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,649.879,654.7,"Well, the individual had been at the Correctional Center for a few months."
1987.86-1108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,664.656,674.162,But the record doesn't tell us whether the Defendant was ever told about the purpose of the interview or whether he could participate in it or not.
1987.86-1108,0,41439,susan_r_harritt,,674.162,675.947,"--Well, it--"
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1149.061,1155.584,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1108,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1167.308,1168.642,I am glad to hear you admit it.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1168.642,1186.62,"There is no question the restraints a person suffers in prison or in jail are quite real and quite tangible, but the fact that he is literally in custody in that sense, we do not believe requires that the Court automatically hold he's also in custody for Miranda purposes."
1987.86-1108,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1210.735,1214.52,"So, if he's already there to begin with, the situation is different?"
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1214.52,1216.472,It's not necessarily the same.
1987.86-1108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.218,1241.67,You are going to tell us what the difference is here?
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1241.67,1263.001,"The difference, we believe, is this: the restraints that a person has on him in custody imposed the background environment in which he must live, but those restraints are not of the type that would necessarily in every case lead a person to believe that he had no alternative but to confess when he is confronted with someone who is asking him questions."
1987.86-1108,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1368.12,1370.805,"Kind of an unnecessary choice, too, isn't it?"
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1370.805,1372.757,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1987.86-1108,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1374.357,1377.126,"Well, who has the burden of demonstrating the reason?"
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1381.328,1395.437,"We would believe that since Miranda establishes an exception from the general rule that all relevant evidence is admissible, the burden of showing that Miranda is applicable should be on the person invoking that exception."
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.783,1452.376,"Mr. Larkin, would you defend a rule that said that we will have these interviews for a person's presentence report without counsel only and if the defendant wants counsel, he can't have the interview?"
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1462.232,1466.351,"--Well, it's not a rule that would arise in the Federal system because--"
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.351,1467.053,I understand.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1467.053,1468.419,--the probation office does object to it.
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1468.419,1475.306,"That's, in effect, what happened here because he had asked for a lawyer and she said... you acknowledge it's the equivalent of asking for a lawyer, I think."
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1475.306,1475.772,Yes.
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.058,1480.943,And that is considered irrelevant as a matter of law?
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1480.943,1495.053,"We don't think forcing him to that choice, even if that was that type of rule, would violate his Sixth Amendment right, If there was a violation, what it would amount to is a violation of perhaps his right whether to go forward with allocution or something along those lines."
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.053,1500.274,"If there is no constitutional right to a lawyer at an interview of this kind, basically?"
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1500.274,1501.724,No.
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.415,1514.215,You say he would have a constitutional right to have a lawyer present?
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1514.215,1520.353,--We believe that this would be a critical stage of the proceedings The state disagrees with that.
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.905,1525.138,Yes.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1525.621,1530.256,"But it is not unlawful, we think, to put him to a choice like this."
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.082,1550.533,You either go ahead without the lawyer or you don't have it.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1552.819,1556.771,--Because they were open and up front and put all their cards on the table.
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.785,1581.672,He did not have the opportunity to have a pre-sentence interview with the lawyer present.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1581.672,1584.005,--At that time.
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.141,1587.993,Or at any other time because she said it's either now or never.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1587.993,1594.396,"--Even if they had adopted that rule, we would say that it would not violate his Sixth Amendment right."
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1601.266,1602.335,That's this case.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1609.322,1614.743,"--On those facts, we would say it would not violate his Sixth Amendment right to counsel."
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.271,1636.473,But I thought you said you agreed this was a critical stage of the prosecution?
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1636.473,1637.508,Yes.
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.245,1649.733,But you're defending the state's right to say we can force you to go through the critical stage of the prosecution.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1659.255,1661.041,--That's right.
1987.86-1108,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.966,1686.739,To require somebody to do something in the judicial process without a lawyer does not touch the Sixth Amendment?
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1686.739,1688.055,"--No, we didn't say that."
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.882,1741.273,"Supposing it was a trial, he wanted to put on his defense, he says my lawyer isn't here yet, the judge said you either put on your defense by yourself or you can't put on a defense, would that be a fair choice for a critical stage?"
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1741.273,1741.656,No.
1987.86-1108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1742.273,1744.392,That's an even more critical stage.
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1745.058,1747.094,--It is quite a different stage entirely.
1987.86-1108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.094,1757.282,"The difference there, I take it, is that you would say you have to give the man a trial."
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1766.155,1769.607,There is nothing that requires a presentence report be conducted.
1987.86-1108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.011,1781.981,"So, the failure or the refusal to go ahead without a lawyer, you say, if it violates anything, doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment but some right to having that interview--"
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1781.981,1782.517,That's right.
1987.86-1108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.517,1788.937,"--just as in the trial case just given, if there were any violations, what you would have been deprived of was not your right to a lawyer but your right to the trial."
1987.86-1108,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1788.937,1790.653,That's right.
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,1804.043,1810.114,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.652,1878.508,Wasn't a correct statement of his options under state law... why didn't the Supreme Court of Vermont go on that ground rather than raising a federal constitutional question?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,1878.508,1911.848,"--I think they felt that depriving, Mr. Chief Justice, depriving him of a state law benefit, if it be only a state law benefit to have the right to counsel before being required to participate in the pre-sentence investigation interview, was a valuable state benefit, and as this Court has held in its Fifth Amendment penalty cases, when you seek to retain a valuable, albeit state-created benefit, and the Government says you're going to lose that benefit, if you claim the Fifth Amendment, then the Court has found that that is compulsion."
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1917.65,1920.704,I hadn't read the Supreme Court of Vermont opinion quite that way.
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,1920.704,1927.274,"Well, I think that is at least a permissible reading."
1987.86-1108,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1936.23,1941.016,"Well, I guess the Court below didn't address that at all, did it?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,1941.016,1942.2,The Sixth Amendment?
1987.86-1108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.633,2077.787,"Well, all he was coerced into doing was attending the pre-sentence interview, right?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2088.845,2090.695,That's correct.
1987.86-1108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.695,2096.349,Was there any coercion to provide any incriminating statements about himself?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2096.349,2120.214,"There was coercion for him to seize the opportunity to make a statement, I maintain, and the only opportunity offered him because he was told by the probation officer that he would never have another chance, he made, we contend, an ill-advised decision without counsel to offer material that counsel well and probably should have advised him not to give."
1987.86-1108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.214,2123.249,"Well, that relates to the counsel violation, which is a different one."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2138.176,2154.201,"I think that being told that you would never have another chance, incorrectly told that he would never have another chance because the Vermont Court said, in fact, that wasn't an appropriate choice to put him to, was coercive in that--"
1987.86-1108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2154.201,2155.335,Coercive of what?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2157.303,2160.505,"--And, also, when there, Your Honor, I think--"
1987.86-1108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.505,2165.326,"But he could have gone to the interview and said, you know, just nice good things."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2170.73,2178.734,--The coercion was the loss of the opportunity to make a decision whether to offer any sort of material with counsel.
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2208.086,2219.878,"Mr. Hinton, as a matter of practice in these Vermont pre-sentence investigations, I take it would you say ordinarily a defendant does attend with counsel?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2219.878,2227.483,My understanding is that there's no rule in Vermont that says that you can or cannot.
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.772,2250.932,"From what you know, is it customary for a lawyer to sit there and then the probation officer to ask questions and the lawyer to advise the defendant not to answer on the grounds it might incriminate him?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2250.932,2255.551,I am not aware if that is commonly done or usually done.
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.551,2265.958,"It strikes me that whatever the abstract constitutional right of the situation may be, this is not a very good way for a defendant to get a favorable pre-sentence report."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2265.958,2270.143,"As a matter of fact, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you might be correct."
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2333.669,2342.025,"And this is the equivalent of counsel in the views of the Vermont Supreme Court, an investigator from the defense counsel's office?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2342.025,2354.999,"--For the purposes of Fifth Amendment argument, I think that they certainly feel like and have decided that the investigator at least should have a right to investigate."
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2394.541,2397.576,"We've never held that, have we?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2397.576,2399.261,"No, Your Honor, you've never held that."
1987.86-1108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.688,2443.724,Why do you need a lawyer?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2454.448,2458.75,"I think that's correct, that the rules of evidence don't apply at sentencing."
1987.86-1108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2458.75,2461.935,Don't apply to the probation report.
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2466.421,2468.971,"The probation... well,--"
1987.86-1108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2468.971,2470.557,He talks to anybody.
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2472.159,2488.335,"--The probation officer... we're not asserting the right, Justice Marshall, to have the probation officer accompanied by a defense investigator or a lawyer in all of his or her investigative efforts."
1987.86-1108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.335,2490.287,"Well, why do you need it with your client?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2490.287,2505.131,"The reason is that's a confrontation between the accused and an agent of the state in which, as happened in this case, the accused can, through inadvertence or lack of knowledge, incriminate himself."
1987.86-1108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.131,2508.415,And can also get himself a low sentence.
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2508.415,2509.665,That's right.
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.794,2530.846,"Well, merely incriminating himself isn't enough to make a Fifth Amendment case."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2532.281,2533.664,That's correct.
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.664,2552.361,"And in the usual arrest and interrogation situation, where counsel isn't present, the impression the officers give is that we're going to keep you here till you answer, and that's what triggered the right to have counsel present."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2558.348,2567.621,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I don't maintain that you have to presume as in the Miranda context in this case compulsion."
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.083,2600.775,"Well, he could make his choice, which is worse for him, being quiet or speaking, and that's the kind of choice that people have to make at trial all the time."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2600.775,2604.143,That is the kind of choice people have to make at trial.
1987.86-1108,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2619.153,2625.807,"Well, it seems to me that's just your Sixth Amendment claim, not the Fifth Amendment claim."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2647.153,2698.169,"That's correct, but the way the counsel issue, Justice O'Connor, fits into the Fifth Amendment argument is that even if you assume that there is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel conferred by the federal Constitution, which we maintain there certainly should be a critical stage like a PSI interview, but even if you assume there's not, there's a Vermont law right to confer with counsel which the probation officer in this case did not respect, and because the probation officer offered an alternative or a set of alternatives to Mr. Cox that the law of Vermont doesn't even find to be permissible, he made an unfree, if you will, or a coerced choice when he went ahead and spoke."
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.169,2702.307,"Well, the Vermont Supreme Court, though, went to the Fifth Amendment."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2709.627,2712.596,"Well, I asked them to, Your Honor."
1987.86-1108,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2714.615,2719.4,You argued the case in the Vermont court--
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2719.4,2722.636,"In the Supreme Court of Vermont, but not in the trial court."
1987.86-1108,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2722.636,2725.505,"--Well, was your office, what is it, the--"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2725.505,2727.638,The Defender General's office?
1987.86-1108,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2727.638,2728.038,--Yes.
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2730.457,2737.23,"The public defender in Burlington, the public defender office, represented Mr. Cox at trial and then at the--"
1987.86-1108,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2737.23,2743.3,Did it represent him at the time of this interview with the probation officer?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2743.3,2744.434,--That's correct.
1987.86-1108,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2745.984,2752.99,But we don't know whether or not they advised him to act as he did when he submitted--
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2752.99,2777.771,"From the record, we only know that since counsel claimed that she didn't get an adequate opportunity to advise Mr. Cox and unlike what counsel for the State of Vermont represented, we can't assume from this record that there was some period of time after the guilty pleas or the nolo pleas or some reasonable period of time before she showed up for the interview."
1987.86-1108,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2780.021,2784.175,"--Tell me, you were not amicus in the Vermont Supreme Court, were you?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2784.175,2786.391,"--I am only amicus in this Court, Your Honor."
1987.86-1108,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2796.649,2799.868,And you can't find him because he served his sentence and he beat it?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2799.868,2802.303,--He's gone from Vermont.
1987.86-1108,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2807.338,2810.806,Would it be good sense for him to come back to Vermont after he served his sentence?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2810.806,2810.923,I think not.
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.716,2834.421,"If he calls you up and says can I come back, I take it you would tell him, if you can make a living somewhere else, please do?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2834.421,2840.809,I think that's probably what both I would tell him and probably the prosecuting authorities would be happy with.
1987.86-1108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.809,2845.713,"Then, why did you press his case in the Supreme Court of Vermont once he had served his sentence?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2848.665,2853.05,"I can't recall exactly, Justice Scalia, the chronology."
1987.86-1108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2876.915,2884.354,"If he comes back and commits another crime, he's going to get another sentence, right?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2884.354,2889.04,"Well, he's going to get sentenced--"
1987.86-1108,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2889.04,2891.675,I don't think there's any possibility of him coming back.
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2891.675,2893.86,--I think he'd be foolish to come back.
1987.86-1108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2927.431,2938.139,"If he does come back, though, the state is, on this decision of the Vermont Supreme Court, bound to give him another sentencing hearing?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2938.139,2939.173,I think if he presses--
1987.86-1108,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2939.173,2940.341,"So, it's entirely up to him."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2952.148,2965.623,"--Yes, it would be in his interests, but I think the likelihood of getting a deferred sentence, because he's got a prior record of criminal offenses that existed in other states way before these three simple assaults."
1987.86-1108,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.623,2967.658,"Mr. Hinton, let me ask you a variation of these questions."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2984.704,2988.822,Very little.
1987.86-1108,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.822,2990.189,"He doesn't have any, does he?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,2993.809,3004.598,"I can't imagine, unless it was something that if he like negotiated from afar so that he didn't subject himself to anything unless and until it was all worked out and he came to the Vermont--"
1987.86-1108,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.598,3008.919,"He certainly would not pay a lawyer a usual and customary rate to argue this case for him, would he?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3008.919,3010.535,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3136.0,3148.791,"Again, as matter of practice, is it common in a situation like this for a defendant not to participate in the interview with the probation officer?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3148.791,3164.919,"If the defendant has got a very terrible record and is very unlikely to do anything more than make it worse, I think non-participation would be what would be called for."
1987.86-1108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3164.919,3170.823,"And that's the advice that the public defender of Chittenden County would give to somebody like that, I take it?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3180.979,3183.297,Some... I think that's true.
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.118,3198.723,Do you think that there's still... do you think we have jurisdiction to decide this case?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3207.662,3209.114,"--As a practical matter, I don't think there is--"
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3209.114,3211.733,"As a technical matter, is this moot or not?"
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3211.733,3213.066,"--As a technical, theoretical matter, it might be."
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.066,3219.637,"If we just dismiss it as moot, then the order on the state still stands."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3224.541,3228.66,"Well, they have the order outstanding."
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.66,3232.48,"I know, but you don't think it means very much as a practical matter."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3232.48,3237.098,I don't think they have... they don't have to do anything other than worry about it if he comes back.
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.098,3238.634,"Well, worry about it now."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3244.371,3251.775,I think that only in the most technical way is it not moot.
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.775,3255.493,"Well, mootness is technical in itself."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3263.915,3270.586,They don't have to grant him a re-sentencing unless he seeks it and--
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3270.586,3281.977,Would you object to if the state said... want back and asked to be relieved from that order?
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3281.977,3284.346,--On the grounds of mootness?
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3284.346,3290.167,"Well, just on the ground that you say there's nothing to the case."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3292.852,3295.602,I only care if he comes back.
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.602,3299.356,I guess you care enough then.
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3299.356,3302.041,"Well, perhaps--"
1987.86-1108,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.041,3304.424,"But you told me that if he came back, he wouldn't ask for anything anyway."
1987.86-1108,2,27227,henry_hinton,,3310.045,3310.328,--Right.
1987.86-1108,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.328,3319.419,"But, then, he wouldn't ask for anything, but if he came back, the police would... the state would pick him up, pick him up and re-sentence him pursuant to this order."
