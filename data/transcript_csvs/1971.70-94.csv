1971.70-94,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.886,"We will hear arguments next in 70-94, in the matter of Paul Pappas."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,10.611,13.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-94,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,244.624,261.303,"Suppose right there, Mr. Prettyman that an unexpected event took place then, not the police raid, but suppose some internal quarrel of the group resulted in one of them killing another in his site."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,265.835,268.241,I think the privilege would come into play.
1971.70-94,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,289.001,295.976,"Let’s reduce the crime now, instead of the killing, just a serious injury, same procedure?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,295.976,310.746,"This is precisely, Your Honor, why we suggest to you that there must be a balancing test and this is one of the factors that undoubtedly a judge would take into consideration in determining where the balance lies in this particular case."
1971.70-94,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,328.559,344.175,"Would you say the same result would obtain if while there, he observed the packaging or processing heroin from the raw state to street sale state?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,344.175,346.047,Precisely.
1971.70-94,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,377.222,381.915,"What does that do to his credibility with these people, I suppose --"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,381.915,387.59,"Your Honor, I think the relationship of confidentiality that can come into effect for any number of reasons."
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.265,415.492,"Mr. Prettyman, I take it then that you say that the balancing goes on, on an ad hoc basis in each particular case, on a specific factor of this case?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,415.492,416.146,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.146,419.535,Without any general rules or standards?
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,419.535,438.09,"General rule that I would lay down, Mr. Justice White is that there is a privilege and that there is a presumption that the newsman is protected and then and only then can the Government come in with its burden and attempt to carry it by showing the various of elements that we have outlined in our brief."
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.09,447.232,"Well, what you would require, shall they say we need this evidence to prove a crime, the packages of heroin or the making of bombs or murder, or something like that."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,447.232,448.58,"Well, let me emphasize."
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.711,500.696,"Well, on that matter, the point -- just a necessity to make the criminal case wouldn’t be automatically enough, would it?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,500.696,501.381,No sir.
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.323,504.443,"Well, you’d have to distinguish between crimes."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,504.443,505.617,I do.
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.686,552.207,But I suppose if you’re going really to achieve your purpose of maintaining the flow of information.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,579.05,584.522,"Your Honor, I think there’s the same degree of predictability as there is in a prior restraint case."
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.552,609.728,"You mean, it's just sort of an odd thing, I mean it’s much more likely that not that the privilege would be respected in none of the cases."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,609.728,614.436,"It has even without privilege in many instances before, as was pointed out this morning."
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.436,616.596,The situation without some Constitutional privilege.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,616.596,620.916,I am afraid Your Honor that if the privilege was stricken we would --
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.916,621.279,Stricken?
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,621.279,626.012,"We would [Laughter Attempt] if it was not allowed, [Laughter] we would have --"
1971.70-94,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.012,626.777,"Yes, but –-"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,626.777,629.232,We would have a more serious situation.
1971.70-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.232,659.94,"Mr. Prettyman, do you say that one of your standards is that if a Grand Jury must be investigating a specific crime that sounds simple, but I think if to me that imposes some problems.Supposing you have a Grand Jury convene to say investigate an ambulance chasing ring with police participation as they recently had in Chicago or a widespread graft and corruption among officials?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,674.057,682.938,"Your Honor, if you will look at the Caldwell subpoena you will see specific crimes set out that the Grand Jury were investigating."
1971.70-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.31,725.484,"Well, what then is your answer to my question?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,725.484,749.421,"My answer is that while it’s quite true that in many instances the Grand Jury will go from one crime to another or will go from suspicion to fact that where you have First Amendment privilege involved, the heavy duty involved in the prosecution in trammeling on that privilege that there, there is a duty to indicate that kind of situation that they’re inquiring into."
1971.70-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.691,800.374,"Well, supposing they do come forward and say that we’re investigating allegations of an ambulance chasing rocket with police connivance and violations, which could be violations of several State statutes and say no more than that."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,805.511,814.455,"If they cited a statute that they said was violated and gave a period of time and a place when it was suppose to have occurred, I would say yes, it would meet my definition."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,838.196,843.846,"Mr. Prettyman, is that the normal subpoena in Massachusetts in that general language?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,843.846,847.272,It’s my understanding that while sometimes they are more specific that this --
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,847.272,847.801,It’s no --
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,847.801,851.323,"This is in -- as a matter of fact it is on a form, Your Honor, because it has a --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.323,853.371,"Well, that’s what I assumed --"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,853.371,860.807,"Yes, it has -- as you’ll see it has a blank space said, blank or the Grand Jury and --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,860.807,867.588,"But why, I was thinking was it under that, must I cast question in asked in the first case?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,883.813,892.677,"Your Honor, it was not argued below in this case, that the man did not have to appear before the Grand Jury."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,902.231,903.702,"Well, that’s not my point."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,914.473,917.179,"But, that would not have been received in confidence Mr. Justice."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,917.179,921.852,"Well, I mean, but -- if he was a newspaperman he wouldn’t go."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,921.852,923.155,"No sir, I quite disagree, he would go."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,927.342,935.252,"Well, suppose on this day, he went there and told the people, whatever you say, I’ll keep it in confidence."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,944.871,952.511,"No, no I was raising the generality of the subpoena only in relation to the specific confidentiality that has been imposed upon him."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,976.425,985.797,But why does he have to be more specific about this automobile accident with the reporter than with anybody else?
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,985.797,990.063,"Because, the judge is going to have to make a decision --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,990.063,990.368,Why?
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,990.368,991.511,Balancing the various interest as --
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,991.511,992.368,Why?
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,995.118,999.616,"Because, Your Honor, he is obtaining information for the public --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,999.616,1001.158,"No, no."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1015.56,1017.225,"I think you have to give him a hearing, because --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1017.225,1020.075,Merely because he is a reporter.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1020.075,1033.307,"Merely because he is part of the press, protected by the First Amendment, who has received information in order to get a dissemination of information to the public and without this kind of showing."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1033.307,1039.069,"But how does the Grand Jury know that he’s got this confidential information, in my case?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1039.069,1044.102,He is asserts it in the same way that a Grand Jury doesn’t know that a fellow is going to play the bet until he plays it
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.102,1046.948,Let’s get at the facts right now.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1069.291,1077.367,"Your Honor, if I understand your question correctly, what he saw was not protected by the privilege, because he did not receive it in his direction."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1077.367,1078.081,"That’s right, --"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1078.081,1080.952,And he stands in the shoes of any other man.
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1089.596,1091.478,He hadn’t printed that yet.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1091.478,1091.953,"Well, yes."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1091.953,1094.523,So nobody knows he’s got it.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1094.523,1095.4,"Well, the fact remains Your Honor --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1095.4,1098.307,And then he still -- he gets different treatment on the subpoena.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1098.307,1098.647,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.647,1099.514,That’s problem.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1099.514,1115.408,"Yes, he does Your Honor, and I can only reiterate that the privilege comes into effect when he is obtaining information in confidentiality from sources which busted the confidentiality, he would never receive his story and the public would never receive the story."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1158.993,1163.753,"Which is to -- I may add to my point, let’s be really specific."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1176.145,1176.547,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1176.547,1178.466,Solely because he’s newspaper.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1178.466,1179.628,"Well, I can only --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.628,1180.426,Is that your position?
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1180.426,1182.14,"No, sir."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1189.318,1195.237,"Well, did newspaperman received information in confidence, which he never probably publish to any place?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1195.237,1198.316,"Alright, now there is a lot of information, Your Honor, which in this --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1198.316,1205.618,"Well, I knew, does the fact that he has this information or the fact that he’s a newspaper reporter?"
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1206.983,1208.754,Can I draw this distinction for you?
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.471,1272.025,"I have to ask for that in my case, I just want -- talking about this crime."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1272.025,1274.943,"Well, I am sorry if I haven’t satisfied you, I --"
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1274.943,1286.251,"So, my whole problem is, if the procedure that you sit on is something in addition to what we’d normally have in the judicial presence."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1296.046,1296.848,That’s right.
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.848,1299.653,"But, the newspaperman according to you doesn’t have to move to quash."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1299.653,1307.337,"Only if he has information, which he received in confidence, perhaps we can -- perhaps I can satisfy you by analogizing with the Fifth Amendment."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1328.612,1332.859,"No, you aren’t distinct in going into the Grand Jury room."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1335.169,1342.766,"Can I put the appearance before the Grand Jury to one side, because the problem is that I -- we did not argue this below."
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1354.213,1360.553,"And you say that if they ask him about the crime, he would of course testify to it."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1363.435,1363.538,Oh!
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1363.925,1364.92,He would testify.
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1364.92,1365.66,Absolutely.
1971.70-94,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1365.66,1368.858,"Well, that’s where I didn’t understand your prohibition to be."
1971.70-94,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1368.858,1370.667,"I am sorry, I didn’t make that clear."
1971.70-94,1,30955,joseph_j_hurley,,2513.143,2516.533,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-94,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,4361.428,4378.121,"But, Your Honor I believe that my argument earlier were pertained equally to this case as it did to the former case, the general question of whether a Constitutional privilege should be recognized in First Amendment."
1971.70-94,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4378.121,4381.766,All I had in mind is that you need not repeat your former arguments.
1971.70-94,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,4381.766,4395.647,"No, I really contend that -- merely to make a couple of additional observations the -- noting that my former argument applies here equally."
1971.70-94,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4661.373,4663.112,Thank you Mr. Reynolds.
1971.70-94,3,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,4665.267,4667.818,I have only two brief to points Your Honor.
