1985.84-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.907,We will hear arguments now in Wisconsin Department of Industry and so forth against Gould.
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,14.442,18.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.453,98.205,"Mr. Hoornstra, what is the purpose of the statute?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,98.205,113.715,"The purpose of the statute, Your Honor, is to spend the state's money on those employers that have exhibited a fidelity to the law and not to spend their money on those who have violated the law."
1985.84-1484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.715,130.245,"Did the state ever concede during the course of this litigation that the purpose of the statute was to deter private conduct, namely the conduct of the respondent and companies like it?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,130.245,131.086,Yes.
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.627,200.383,"May I ask on that point, General Hoornstra, does the Wisconsin Legislature define any other groups of ineligible suppliers other than this one?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,200.383,201.803,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,220.506,225.939,"Is that a similar pattern, if they've been found guilty on three separate occasions or something like that?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,225.939,237.026,"Basically, without that precise formulary, and without a deference to the federal machinery since we have co-equal jurisdiction to adjudicate that ourselves."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,239.456,246.052,"What about violating something like the RICOH statute or, committed a lot of arsons or something like that?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,246.052,264.155,"We don't have anything as express, Your Honor, but I think I can say that our catchall statute of rewarding contracts to the lowest responsible bidder, we would regard as a catchall authorization so we don't have to deal with organized crime either."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,268.875,272.369,No other statutory category of ineligible suppliers?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,272.369,277.691,"--Correct, so we're prepared to lose money on a particular deal if we're dealing with discrimination."
1985.84-1484,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,288.89,294.685,"These unfair labor practices did not take place in Wisconsin, did they?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,294.685,295.784,--That is correct.
1985.84-1484,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,295.784,301.919,And were they by divisions of Gould that are no longer owned by Gould?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,301.919,303.501,Yes.
1985.84-1484,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,303.501,314.657,Are there situations under the Labor Act where an employer has to commit an unfair labor practice in order to get judicial review?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,314.657,315.137,Yes.
1985.84-1484,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,315.137,322.501,"You are penalizing that particular employer, aren't you?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,322.501,335.33,"Well, permit me first to say that those questions, I believe, are all Fourteenth Amendment questions, not NLRA pre-emption questions."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.557,546.858,"Is that really a fair characterization, a choice between... you have a flat rule that even if there's only one supplier, you just can't buy the goods, independent of if there are a hundred, you can still just... it isn't choosing between two, is it?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,546.858,548.38,That's true.
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.691,553.112,"It's legislative prohibition, it's not an individual decision by a purchasing agent."
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,555.283,560.688,"--No, you understand correctly, Your Honor, and I think I understand the purport of your question."
1985.84-1484,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,575.796,581.422,How long has Wisconsin had this statute?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,581.422,585.524,It was passed in May of 1980.
1985.84-1484,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,585.524,590.946,Is a statute of this kind fairly common among the other states?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,590.946,591.477,No.
1985.84-1484,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,591.477,593.788,What brought it about in Wisconsin?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,593.788,596.97,I don't know.
1985.84-1484,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.538,727.326,"Of course, that may be true under the dormant Commerce Clause and not true where Congress has affirmatively enacted a law such as the NLRA, I suppose."
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,727.326,727.936,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.114,887.01,"Mr. Hoornstra, you surely don't contend the state can have the same latitude as a private purchaser in all its decisions on purchasing, do you?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,887.01,887.711,"--No, sir."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.711,890.172,"Because they could say, we won't purchase from Baptists--"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,890.172,891.063,Absolutely.
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.778,914.93,"--What if they said, we won't purchase from any out of state companies?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,914.93,920.041,I have a real problem with that under the privileges and--
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.041,925.705,"How about even under the Commerce Clause, for any companies that are engaged in interstate commerce--"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,925.705,932.521,--I think that would be a negative inhibition on Wisconsin under the Commerce Clause.
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.521,935.405,--They don't really have the same freedom as a private purchaser?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,935.405,936.284,That's correct.
1985.84-1484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.879,966.034,Can the state decide that it won't purchase from any unionized company or employer?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,966.034,976.051,"The Second Circuit has said yes, and the other side of that coin, it said it can have contracts, the state can have a contract with union printers only."
1985.84-1484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,981.985,990.07,"Well, under your view the state would be free to say, we will not buy from any employer whose employees belong to a union?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,990.07,993.954,"Under the NLRA, that's right."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.329,1051.269,Let me interrupt you again.
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1071.643,1074.683,"I concede I have a problem defending that statute, that I wouldn't have--"
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.683,1075.765,"It would be a pre-emption problems, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1075.765,1076.446,--Pardon?
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.446,1078.127,It would be a pre-emption problem?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1078.127,1078.898,"Yes, yes."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.898,1081.779,"If there is pre-emption of that, why isn't there also pre-emption where you're the purchaser?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1084.551,1089.083,"Because in the circumstance you raised, the state is acting as a lawgiver."
1985.84-1484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.083,1091.226,But what has that got to do with pre-emption?
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1097.331,1110.268,"Because the pre-emption issue... the pre-emption issue turns on where you've got conflicting regulations and when the state acts as a regulator, as a lawgiver in an area acted by Congress, that's what pre-emption is about."
1985.84-1484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1110.268,1121.436,"But if the purpose of the statute is to deter private conduct, why doesn't that bring you in under the pre-emption?"
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1151.074,1161.632,"Because it's a spending power decision, and that's why I think the significance of this Court's statement in Camden cannot be underscored enough."
1985.84-1484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1161.632,1172.438,But the spending seems to be related to a regulatory purpose as opposed to a purpose devoted to assuring a certain source of supply.
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1172.438,1184.837,"The spending power cases, I submit, say that you may engage in a spending power decision which is not regulation, even though you're serving the same kind of purpose, so long as you're dealing with your buying power."
1985.84-1484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1188.79,1197.255,"You mean, under the dormant Commerce Clause context, and maybe it's different if you're dealing with the National Labor Relations Act pre-emption question."
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1197.255,1221.512,"--It might be, but if our touchstone is the intent of Congress to limit somebody's buying power in trying to influence the conduct of others, inasmuch... especially, I should say, since we're dealing with a sovereign prerogative of making policy choices for its people, the burden is pretty heavy simply as a matter of the principles of our federalism to show why Congress would want to say to a state, you have to deal with these law violators even if you don't want to."
1985.84-1484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1222.821,1248.597,"Except that Congress has set up a very broad, detailed Act in this labor field in which it has spelled out what the penalties are and it has structured the Act in such a way that an employer isn't always given an option whether the employer is to be a violator of the Act or not."
1985.84-1484,0,19159,charles_d_hoornstra,,1248.597,1261.186,"--That's true, and in no circumstance where those considerations apply do they apply to someone making a purchasing decision, a buying decision."
1985.84-1484,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1276.808,1284.992,Mr. Gangemi.
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1284.992,1293.107,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1327.71,1336.356,"Do you really think it makes a lot of difference what the purpose of the state was, if we know what the effect of the statute is?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1336.356,1350.416,"In the final analysis, Justice Rehnquist, I agree with you that the purpose of the state is irrelevant if the effect is to interfere with the federal statutory scheme."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.389,1377.754,"And so, then it really turns on what sort of an argument the Assistant Attorney General for the State of Wisconsin makes to the Seventh Circuit?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1377.754,1396.655,"Insofar as that is a statement of the purpose of the statute, no, I do not... in the final analysis I agree with you that the purpose of the statute, the object of the statute, is irrelevant."
1985.84-1484,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1412.986,1430.087,"Well, then, what if the state is concerned about having steady source of supply of whatever the product is that it's buying, and it doesn't want to buy from somebody who's engaged in labor disputes because it thinks there are going to be strikes and its source of supply might be cut off."
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1440.974,1447.478,I believe it depends upon the object of the decision not to purchase.
1985.84-1484,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.531,1455.943,"Then it does make a difference what the purpose is, in contrast to what you've just been telling Justice Rehnquist?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1458.095,1471.665,--It makes a difference only in those cases in which the interference is of a peripheral nature.
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1556.059,1568.056,"Mr. Gangemi, why can't the state adopt something of a prophylactic rule for something it considers a three-time loser in the area of labor law violations?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1574.802,1585.508,"Because, Your Honor, the Winconsin statute addresses labor law violations, violation of federal law, qua violation of federal law."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.333,1610.715,Why does it have to be that precise?
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1610.715,1617.498,I think it has to be that precise because there is a very definite interference with the federal statutory scheme.
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.498,1620.901,How does it interfere with the federal statute?
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1624.804,1636.742,"Well, Your Honor, I believe it interferes with the federal right of appeal because this statute does not debar individuals who are unfair labor practice violators."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.654,1691.048,And you say Wisconsin statute penalizes the first but not the second?
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1691.048,1693.89,"No, it penalizes the employer in both cases, Your Honor."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.751,1732.894,"Well, is your complaint, then, that Wisconsin doesn't also include people who have lost before the NLRB but don't appeal to the Court of Appeals?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1732.894,1736.246,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.246,1741.04,What is your... what is your complaint as to this right of appeal business?
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1741.04,1773.322,"At the time at which the employer must decide whether to seek review before the United States Court of Appeals, either directly by filing his appeal himself or indirectly by allowing... by refusing to obey the Board order and allow the Board to appeal the case to the court of appeals, a chilling effect sets in because the employer knows that if he does that and loses then he will be debarred by state contract, from state contracts."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.322,1780.986,"If he either appeals himself or doesn't appeal and lets the board come against him, in either even he'll be debarred, won't he?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1780.986,1781.697,"That is right, Your Honor."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.697,1784.519,"So, how does that in any way penalize his right to appeal?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1787.591,1788.911,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.436,1877.558,"Well, your right to appeal point is different than your pre-emption point, isn't it?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1877.558,1878.6,"No, it isn't, Your Honor."
1985.84-1484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.626,1916.624,"May I just ask, since you paused, you started to tell us what the purpose for the statute was in the court of appeals."
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,1918.886,1929.835,"I wanted to underscore the statements of purpose of the State of Wisconsin below, which I think have not been really set forth in the briefs before this Court."
1985.84-1484,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2129.654,2145.893,"--In your view, could the state adopt a policy of honoring every lawful union request to boycott the products of an employer whose employees are on strike, just make that a state policy?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,2145.893,2148.107,I do not believe that it could be made a state policy.
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.228,2246.4,"Mr. Gangemi, what if under Justice Stevens' hypothesis put to General Hoornstra, the State of Wisconsin has a statute prohibiting and contracts for supplies with any firms who have been convicted of violating RICOH."
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,2248.473,2255.325,I am not familiar with the pre-emptive... precedents on pre-emption of RICOH.
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.296,2258.537,I'm not sure there are any.
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,2258.537,2259.638,--I don't think there are.
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2312.173,2318.908,"But we've never extended that to simply purchasing by a state as opposed to regulating, have we?"
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,2318.908,2331.775,"I believe this Court has made it quite clear under, first of all McCulloch with respect to pre-emption generally, McCulloch versus Maryland, and Garment under the labor law pre-emption."
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.764,2377.856,But that's a form of the state regulating a labor activity.
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,2377.856,2379.136,All right.
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.383,2482.215,What if the Wisconsin statute had been framed in terms of employers who three times within the last five years have been subjected to strikes of more than six months' duration and it was limited to contractors who were going to bid on jobs in Wisconsin?
1985.84-1484,1,19007,columbus_r_gangemi,,2482.215,2495.285,"If the object of the statute, it seems to me, were directed at the labor dispute and not at an unfair labor practice qua unfair labor practice--"
1985.84-1484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.285,2500.698,"We don't care who started the strike, we just don't want to deal with employers who have long strikes, with contractors."
