1964.26,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.624,"Number 26, Whitney National Bank and Jefferson Parish, Petitioner, versus Bank of New Orleans and Trust company et al., and Number 30, James J. Saxon, Comptroller of the Currency, Petitioner, versus Bank of New Orleans and Trusty Company."
1964.26,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,21.409,26.521,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1964.26,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,192.516,195.532,That was before the passage of the statute.
1964.26,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,195.532,198.027,Yes sir.
1964.26,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.526,249.909,(Inaudible)
1964.26,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,249.909,269.829,"If it were to succeed, I would assume that the Board's order would either be disapproved or that the case would be remanded to the Federal Reserve Board and I think for all practical purposes that would moot this litigation."
1964.26,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,290.79,294.774,And that issue was attacked in the Fifth Circuit?
1964.26,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,294.774,310.969,"Yes, the Board's order is attacked in the Fifth Circuit and we are in effect arguing that this attack is an impermissible collateral attack upon a subject matter which is committed to the Board and is properly reviewable in the Fifth Circuit."
1964.26,1,20488,dean_acheson,,2580.196,2587.648,May it please the Court.
1964.26,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2771.926,2777.771,According to that â€“ to that state -- there are that we have regarded I suppose.
1964.26,1,20488,dean_acheson,,2777.771,2778.345,There are --
1964.26,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2778.345,2780.87,(Inaudible)
1964.26,1,20488,dean_acheson,,2780.87,2794.49,"Now, Mr. Justice there are states which have the exact four provisions of the Louisiana statute and then stopped and this is almost the identical legislation that occurs in other states."
1964.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.61,2819.592,Is it that Act?
1964.26,1,20488,dean_acheson,,2819.592,2820.213,I beg your pardon.
1964.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.213,2823.133,I mean is this solely supposed to be in Section 5.
1964.26,1,20488,dean_acheson,,2826.967,2827.721,Yes.
1964.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2830.868,2836.215,"On page 74 of your brief, Mr. Acheson, I think bottom of the page."
1964.26,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2836.215,2837.186,I have it.
1964.26,1,20488,dean_acheson,,2837.186,2840.222,You have it.
1964.26,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3092.796,3108.257,(Inaudible)
1964.26,1,20488,dean_acheson,,3108.257,3110.749,That's the -- they -- they're not involved here at all.
1964.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3307.429,3308.555,Mr. Merrigan?
1964.26,2,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3308.555,3312.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.26,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3486.469,3497.138,Well Mr. Merrigan does the size of the bank -- is the size of the bank relative to the -- to the legal question that's involved here?
1964.26,2,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,3497.138,3511.418,"I think it's overwhelming important, Your Honor, because of course the size of this bank as it poses this threat of unlawful competition to the respondents in this case, is an extremely relevant fact."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,6903.146,6907.732,I heard about the matter of interim relief.
1964.26,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6994.532,6996.368,Well isn't that about the statute?
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7000.966,7003.193,"He was about to, that is right Your Honor."
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7022.017,7027.229,"If he would have prevailed, we also could tell him that your view would be pending (Voice Overlap) in that case but --"
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7027.229,7032.72,"Certainly, I was merely suggesting that I did not think."
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7032.72,7037.032,So why go through all the business with an application to the Fifth Circuit?
1964.26,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7037.032,7038.71,Is that the issue here?
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7038.71,7041.144,No dissent from that Your Honor.
1964.26,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7041.144,7046.074,That may be issued before anybody even get at something.
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7046.074,7053.183,"Well, actually the Fifth Circuit as matters now stand is waiting on Your Honors."
1964.26,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7053.183,7065.716,"Sometimes I remember when I was in the government, they acted predictably and I mean, is that it, asserting perhaps you might get an injunction, so is there any merit for that, I suppose it would be best to prohibit for it to have stay."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7065.716,7067.488,"I'm sorry I didn't catch that last, Your Honor."
1964.26,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7067.488,7074.266,"Is there any merit from the proposition that should be a stay, well perhaps this Court should take to some action."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7074.266,7092.564,I don't question that this Court had concluded that the injunction of the Court of Appeals was improperly issued but also concluded that the matter should be held in advance until the Fifth Circuit completed its review that it could issue an appropriate direction.
1964.26,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7127.644,7132.925,"Did they complain of the violation, an alleged violation of the National Banking Act?"
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7132.925,7133.289,Yes.
1964.26,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7268.795,7292.679,"(Voice Overlap) why does the case at bar that certain end whether this Act was passed on Louisiana, it was admitted to express its hostility questionable to the attorney of the state, this holding of one of his counsel (Inaudible)."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7312.018,7322.139,We do argue that the Louisiana Act cannot stand because of preemption Your Honor without reaching any constitutional question.
1964.26,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7322.139,7324.036,So that's the Constitution questioned.
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7324.036,7329.399,"Well yes, but in the ultimate sense it certainly is."
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7349.838,7358.67,"Well, suppose that Section 7 is authority to the states to have just this point of statute premature."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7358.67,7359.149,Well --
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7359.149,7360.492,Is there any preemption problem then?
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7360.492,7365.425,"No, if you interpreted Section 7 is doing that --"
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7365.425,7368.351,Then do you have this --
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7368.351,7372.692,"That would be an answer to my preemption argument, I don't think Section 7 does that."
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7372.692,7375.422,"Well, about -- what -- on the premise it did?"
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7380.797,7385.534,"Well, I would still question the remedy of an injunction against the Comptroller."
1964.26,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7412.809,7425.515,"Mr. Spritzer, if Section 7 authorizes a statute including this Section 5 provision, can the Board in any event approve this acquisition?"
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7425.515,7445.648,"Well, I would -- what I was suggesting was that the Board, I would suppose that the Board in the first instance rather than the Comptroller would make the initial decision as to whether the action it proposed to take was forbidden by any other provision of law."
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7464.571,7465.98,"Well, you may be right."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7482.454,7482.622,Oh!
1964.26,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7493.353,7494.438,Mr. Acheson (Voice Overlap)
1964.26,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7494.438,7503.067,Why would the Comptroller be the proper person if he's in doubt that (Inaudible).
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7503.067,7504.281,Well I -- I would --
1964.26,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7504.281,7505.866,We are waiting like both of them will know.
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7505.866,7558.984,"I'm not suggesting that the Court can't consider the point in this case, what I was suggesting to Your Honor was that the asserted rights in this case or relate to whether a relationship with the parents to subsidiary should have been approved and as a matter of primary jurisdiction I would think that that issue to begin with was before the Federal Reserve Board rather than the -- rather than the Comptroller having in mind that the Comptroller's functions are solely to determine the more or less formal qualifications imposed by the Banking Act and not to pass upon control relationships or the public interest which is involved or the policies which are involved in such relationships."
1964.26,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7558.984,7574.741,"Suppose we reach the conclusion that he was right and enjoined but he gave, the Court gave their own reasons (Voice Overlap) there was an Act of Louisiana because they have the right to pay decided under Section 7."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7579.67,7580.118,I'm sure that the --
1964.26,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7580.118,7581.278,-- anything?
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7581.278,7607.727,"If Your Honors were to conclude that the Louisiana Act forbad could properly invalidly forbid the opening of the bank, I'm sure that regardless of what kind of an order were entered that that would be the end of this proposal by Whitney Bank because I would have to say, it would attempt to open in that circumstance."
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7656.376,7662.981,And that Section 7 can't be given the scope in this Act with modifying that consequence of the Bank Act?
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7662.981,7663.848,Yes.
1964.26,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7667.558,7677.429,"But as I understand, they now had moved that it seems to me that therefore they can have a thought of amending it."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7690.407,7697.384,What I was saying in response to Justice Brennan's question was that I did not think Section 7 did authorize such a statute that's all I was saying Your Honor.
1964.26,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7697.384,7701.371,"What difference is Section 7 does authorize it, and the Act doesn't."
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7701.371,7703.033,"Oh, I think that is the difference of course."
1964.26,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7703.033,7721.35,"Mr. Spritzer you could say you need some homework, what was the date of the Louisiana Section 5 in reference with reference to the amended or what we call petition for rehearing before the Board?"
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7721.35,7728.939,"I have it here, which the Board approved -- I'll give you the sequence of several events, if that will help."
1964.26,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7757.234,7758.45,And the ruling of the Board?
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7758.45,7765.133,The Board denied rehearing on June 25th.
1964.26,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7774.321,7778.767,Do you have the date when that Act was introduced in the Louisiana legislature?
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7778.767,7785.217,"I think the brief indicate it, I don't recall it."
1964.26,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7789.124,7798.803,(Inaudible)
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7798.803,7799.933,That's right.
1964.26,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7799.933,7801.365,A temporary restraining order.
1964.26,3,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,7801.365,7805.963,"Yes, there was a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction by Judge (Inaudible), as I recall."
