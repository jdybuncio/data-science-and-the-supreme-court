1992.91-1010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.289,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-1010, Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.--"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,13.974,16.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,48.195,53.849,"Mr. Taranto, did you... we haven't held that Puerto Rico is a state for purpose of the Eleventh Amendment, have we?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,53.849,55.718,"No, this Court has not spoken to that question."
1992.91-1010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,79.499,81.299,But it's really an open question in this Court.
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,81.299,82.868,"--Yes, it is an open question in this Court."
1992.91-1010,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,82.868,84.018,But it's not an issue in this case.
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,84.018,84.701,"That's right, it's not."
1992.91-1010,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,89.919,90.169,I see.
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,93.121,95.654,The merits of the Eleventh Amendment claim?
1992.91-1010,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,95.654,99.441,--Whether Puerto Rico is covered by the Eleventh Amendment.
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,99.441,119.854,"No, and Puerto Rico doesn't claim to be covered by the Eleventh Amendment, merely to be entitled to sovereign immunity under the same standards that states have under the Eleventh Amendment because of the structure that Congress established in granting it semi-sovereign status in the Commonwealth Act in 1952."
1992.91-1010,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,119.854,123.223,Could we raise the issue sua sponte here?
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,123.223,125.24,I don't think it is a jurisdictional matter.
1992.91-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.281,138.9,"Even if it is jurisdictional we're assuming it to be true, aren't we?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,142.268,143.135,For purposes of the appeal--
1992.91-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.135,146.22,For purposes of the question we are reaching we are assuming that there is sovereign immunity.
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,146.22,146.57,--Yes.
1992.91-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.57,151.958,"So even if it were jurisdictional we would have authority to behave that way, wouldn't we?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,151.958,168.067,"I think that the question comes to this Court on the assumption that the merits of the claim, going to the appealability issue, that the claim is meritorious, and the only question then is whether the denial of that assumedly meritorious claim should be immediately appealable."
1992.91-1010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,227.672,235.076,"But have we held that an agency of this state, apart from the state itself, is entitled to anything more than protection against monetary liability?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,235.076,235.309,Yes.
1992.91-1010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,236.694,237.628,But Alabama itself was--
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,237.628,242.83,"--The Department of Corrections was also a, one of the two petitioners."
1992.91-1010,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,242.83,243.615,--Wasn't the state itself a party in that case?
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,243.615,252.47,"The state was, and the Department of Corrections, and this Court I think summarily ordered the dismissal of both of those parties."
1992.91-1010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.606,340.759,"I gather from the opinion of the First Circuit in this case, Mr. Taranto, that they may have felt differently about it than you do."
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,347.746,349.282,I don't think so.
1992.91-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.042,443.91,That issue is not before us here.
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,443.91,451.231,The nature of the factors that go into the immunity claim are not before... that issue is not before the Court.
1992.91-1010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.07,493.558,But the complexity of the issue could have something to do with whether it's immediately appealable.
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,493.558,499.045,I think that this Court has said that the discretionary nature of the issue could have something to do with that.
1992.91-1010,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.42,549.894,"Well, I take it that if the claim of immunity were somehow bound up with a decision on the merits of the case the result could be different?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,549.894,551.06,"Yes, I think that's right."
1992.91-1010,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,551.527,554.096,Just understanding the principles of Cohen v. Beneficial Loan?
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,554.096,554.429,--That's right.
1992.91-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.797,602.89,"Mr. Taranto, if we agree with you here, does it mean that there would be an interlocutory appeal in all Federal tort claims cases whenever the Government asserts that it has not waived liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,610.294,611.929,I think that would not follow.
1992.91-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.929,613.013,Why wouldn't it follow?
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,613.013,622.452,Because the nature of the sovereign immunity claim in an Eleventh Amendment context is different from the sovereign immunity claim for the United States.
1992.91-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.083,686.173,"You think somehow in the domestic sovereign immunity situation there is no right not to be tried, there is just a right not to have a judgment?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,689.291,697.195,"I'm not entirely sure what, how the United States, the domestic sovereign immunity case ought to come out."
1992.91-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.317,708.586,"Well, that's a difference, but why is it a difference that ought to make a difference?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,719.393,735.903,"--Well, I'm not sure it would because to start with, whether the United States has waived its sovereign immunity will in general be the same question as whether there is a cause of action, because the causes of action tend to be in fact the waivers of sovereign immunity, I think, with the United States."
1992.91-1010,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,772.176,777.48,"Mr. Taranto, I didn't go back in the First Circuit cases behind this one, the ones that they relied on for precedent."
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,807.815,815.121,As far as I am aware the only full discussion of this issue in the First Circuit is in the Libby against Marshall case.
1992.91-1010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.592,940.566,"Would the distinction you have just drawn, Mr. Taranto, lead to a different result as to appealability in official capacity suits against individuals as opposed to suits against an entity like this one?"
1992.91-1010,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,940.566,964.281,"I think that the answer would be the same, that when a individual state, when a state official is sued in his or her official capacity and the claim is, and that official says this suit is improper because the claim is barred by Edelman against Jordan, is really a claim for retrospective monetary relief, that what that claim means is that the state official is saying I am the state."
1992.91-1010,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.763,1129.496,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1137.619,1140.838,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1010,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1243.286,1248.155,"The instrumentality issue isn't what the court of appeals relied on, is it?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1248.155,1249.706,"That is correct, Justice White."
1992.91-1010,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1260.478,1262.697,So you would suggest affirmance on that ground?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1262.697,1265.982,"--In part correct, among others."
1992.91-1010,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1272.969,1278.206,Then why wasn't it phrased in terms of judgments rather than suits?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1278.206,1290.263,"--Well, the purpose, we believe, of the Eleventh Amendment was to make clear at the time of Chisolm v. Georgia, Justice Souter, that matters that were pending at that time in Federal courts had to be dismissed."
1992.91-1010,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1301.635,1309.372,"We're still, perhaps from your standpoint, stuck with the text, and the text still says suits, not judgments."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1309.372,1311.741,"--Correct, Your Honor, it does clearly say suits."
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.553,1448.659,"Well, to what extent, Mr. Sipkins, can we look behind the language of the amendment which, as Justice Souter pointed out, speaks in terms of suits?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1454.277,1470.537,"Mr. Chief Justice, what I am suggesting is that you can look back to earlier drafts to determine whether the framers clearly intended to preclude suits against sovereigns, and that it was clear that they did not in the earlier drafts because the language was far more clear in the earlier drafts with respect to what they intended."
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.537,1478.19,Well then why not infer that there was some change of intent between the earlier drafts and the language that was finally adopted?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1478.19,1479.975,"Precisely so, sir."
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.068,1501.222,But how do you draw that deduction from the language of the amendment itself?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1501.222,1504.941,"Because in those instances... well, you can't from the language of the amendment itself."
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.706,1535.193,"Mr. Sipkins, your argument is that it's only meant to protect the state fisk?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1543.197,1547.334,"--It is indeed an obstacle, and I clearly admit that, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.029,1629.183,So you're asking us to overrule our earlier cases that say you cannot bring equitable actions against the states?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1629.183,1632.218,"Justice Scalia, we do not believe that it's necessary to overrule--"
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.218,1634.252,"Just leave them there, but they're wrong."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1634.252,1639.138,--They are founded upon a basis that was not necessary for the determination.
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1639.138,1645.542,"So, then the theory you are urging upon us today is inconsistent with those cases, you acknowledge that?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1645.542,1647.994,That is correct.
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.945,1717.406,"Well, do you think it really would make sense from this Court's point of view to give the Eleventh Amendment the sort of overhaul that you're proposing in a case where we're trying to decide whether there is, an order denying Eleventh Amendment immunity is collaterally appealable?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1717.406,1734.785,"What we're suggesting, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is that this Court utilize this opportunity to develop some very clear guidelines for when a matter of this nature is appealable, and that we believe that this case presents such a forum or such a vehicle for the Court to utilize to do that."
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.785,1739.42,"Well, what's wrong with the guidelines that were in Cohen v. Beneficial Loan?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1739.42,1763.721,"One of the problems with the guidelines in Cohen v. Beneficial Loan is that... first of all there are no problems, and we think that if you apply those standards as enunciated and as stated in Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay several years later that it is easy to say that this particular case does not meet at least two of the three standards of Cohen."
1992.91-1010,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1827.757,1830.811,I have the same problem as does the Chief Justice.
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1875.34,1882.494,"Well, as I stated, Justice Kennedy, we have suggested two alternative grounds to uphold the opinion of the First Circuit below."
1992.91-1010,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.062,1958.558,"Why, if we were impressed by this argument, and I don't say we shouldn't be, but why shouldn't we just remand and ask the First Circuit to decide whether this instrumentality deserves to be treated like the state?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1958.558,1963.196,"That is precisely the relief which the petitioners have asked for, and what that would require is that--"
1992.91-1010,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1963.196,1967.314,But don't you think the First Circuit assumed that it was?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,1967.314,1967.781,--No.
1992.91-1010,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.545,2020.283,It... rather than decide that question it preferred to differ from how many courts of appeals?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2020.283,2027.471,"--Well, it did differ, as counsel for petitioner suggests, from at the time I believe four and now perhaps up to as many as eight."
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.151,2124.349,"So your balancing test that you're urging upon us, Mr. Sipkins, would say that if the state eo nomine so to speak is a party it may, it might be entitled to qualified, rather to immediate appeal if its Eleventh Amendment claim is turned down, but an entity that claims to be like the state, like the petitioner here, would not be?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2124.349,2125.366,That is correct.
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.366,2131.353,But if the state itself is a party it seems to me it will never be turned down.
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2131.353,2131.936,Correct.
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.369,2135.971,So that you're really giving absolutely nothing away.
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2135.971,2140.559,"--Well, what I'm giving away is that where it can be determined as a matter of law that it is the state."
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.551,2167.907,"So you're not limiting your balancing just to where the state is a party as such, but it could be a state department or so, that might have the right to immediately appeal?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2167.907,2169.109,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.109,2173.327,"And why isn't, why isn't that question a matter of law here?"
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2173.327,2181.916,It's not a question of as a matter of law here because the petitioner itself has raised issues of fact that are still open and have not yet been decided.
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.94,2220.557,"Well, boy, that's a strange kind of... I mean, there are always factual questions."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2231.211,2232.246,"There are indeed questions of fact, but there--"
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.246,2234.762,Are you saying whenever there's a question of fact the game is off?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2234.762,2236.964,"--No, there are shadings of questions of fact."
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.448,2239.233,"Ah, shadings of questions of fact."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2239.233,2239.783,"--Clearly, Justice--"
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.783,2245.251,How do we paint those shadings in deciding this question of whether there should be an interlocutory appeal?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2245.251,2249.453,"--If the issue can be determined as a matter of law, and here the issue can't be determined as a matter of law."
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.453,2253.571,"Nothing can be determined as a matter of law without some factual content, it seems to me."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2253.571,2257.724,"I don't believe, Justice Scalia, that the question ought to be whether there are facts that are in issue."
1992.91-1010,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.658,2350.917,"Mr. Sipkins, the court of appeals though decided that Cohen just didn't apply and treated the case as though Puerto Rico itself was before it."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2350.917,2352.034,"That is correct, it did."
1992.91-1010,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.034,2367.527,"And that's the issue that we, I thought we were addressing here, and we don't need to say that the, that this instrumentality is the state."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2380.853,2383.369,"I believe, Justice White, that--"
1992.91-1010,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.369,2394.077,And so... but you suggest that we don't even decide the appealability issue but just remand to decide the instrumentality issue?
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2394.077,2404.718,--I believe that on its face this Court can determine that there are open questions of fact and that it was not necessary to permit an interlocutory appeal from the First Circuit with respect to this instrumentality.
1992.91-1010,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2404.718,2419.478,"But for what it's worth, those open issues of fact are not in any way, at least that I understand, implicated by the issues raised by the suit."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2436.488,2450.763,"What is to be gained, Justice Souter, is that we will not know whether or not PRASA has finally exhausted its arguments that it is an arm of the state until we are able to determine precisely how large any judgment that might obtain is."
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2450.763,2451.196,Mr. Sipkins--
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2474.378,2477.413,"No, you're correct, Justice Scalia, you don't do it where--"
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.413,2478.996,We don't do it for the speech and debate clause.
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2478.996,2485.9,"--You don't do it there, and you don't do it in those instances where the Constitution itself is clear that there is an absolute right not to go to trial."
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.9,2495.208,"So ultimately even this argument collapses back into your first argument that there is no, no categorical Eleventh Amendment immunity."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2495.208,2495.775,That there is no--
1992.91-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2495.775,2508.1,"I mean, if I think this is an Eleventh, that the Eleventh Amendment is like the speech or debate clause or the double jeopardy clause, that it entitles the state to stay out of the court, I don't see any reason to treat this any different from the way we treat claims under those clauses."
1992.91-1010,1,38334,peter_w_sipkins,,2508.1,2528.779,"--It collapses into the essence of the Eleventh Amendment and whether or not sovereign immunity is the basis for the Eleventh Amendment on the issue of when the state itself is the defendant or when the state or a state department or agency is the state defendant, but not so where it is something that is so far extended from the sovereign itself."
1992.91-1010,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.904,2541.571,"Thank you, Mr. Sipkins."
1992.91-1010,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2544.523,2549.075,If the Court has no further questions I have no rebuttal.
1992.91-1010,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2549.491,2549.958,Thank you.
