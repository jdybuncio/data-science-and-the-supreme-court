1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted, we will hear arguments next in Minneapolis Star and Tribune against the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,76.064,81.285,Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of this Honorable Court:
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,326.795,333.568,"Mr. Brown, when you say the large circulation dailies, how many of those did that cover within the state?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,333.568,347.041,"--Your Honor, according to the records submitted in support of Star Tribune's summary judgment motion, I think there were approximately 29 and 27."
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.91,357.183,What was the approximate circulation of the newspaper with the least circulation which nonetheless was subject to the tax?
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,357.183,369.824,"I think the Brainard Dispatch, Your Honor, is the one which in 1974 was not subject to the tax and in 1975 was, and it was at about 14 to 15 thousand a year."
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.766,511.966,What's the law--
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,511.966,521.972,"--tax that applied to all consumers, all the newspapers in the state, no exemption on the 100,000."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,521.972,529.395,"And the point being taxed, Mr. Chief Justice, is the use or consumption of paper and ink."
1982.81-1839,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,540.001,542.953,Could I change that a little bit?
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,553.242,557.111,"We would, Mr. Justice Blackmun, but let me say that we would--"
1982.81-1839,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,557.111,557.861,You would or would not?
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,557.861,620.434,"--We would, sir, but we would do so first, with the acknowledgement that in no way does Star and Tribune challenge the power of the state of Minnesota or any other state in the exercise of its broad general revenue-raising tax powers, to impose broad forms of taxation equally and non-discriminatorily on all businesses which are fairly classified together with one caveat, and that is that if there is anything left of Murdock and Follett, we believe that broad form, non-discriminatory taxes as applied in certain First Amendment activity may be unconstitutional because as applied, they improperly burden the exercise of First Amendment activity."
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,620.434,628.457,Could that be rephrased to say the Star Tribune has no objection to the state of Minnesota taxing any business except the newspaper business?
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,628.457,630.107,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,647.585,649.537,I imagine 3M does the same.
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,654.073,655.108,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,661.944,670.614,"Mr. Brown, back in the days of the liner type, could Minnesota tax all users of lead?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,670.614,672.216,Of lead.
1982.81-1839,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,675.768,677.87,This is back when you had liner type.
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,680.322,681.989,"--Well, not all that ancient."
1982.81-1839,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,716.512,717.729,It would be like a payroll tax.
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,717.729,725.35,"I don't think it would be like a payroll tax as applied to the business of publishing a newspaper, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,725.35,732.354,Did I understand your response to mean that only newspapers have First Amendment rights?
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,732.354,734.29,"No, Your Honor, I don't mean to suggest that at all."
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,734.29,737.342,"Well, you suggested that 3M didn't have any First Amendment rights."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,737.342,754.637,"3M does have First Amendment rights when it exercises speech, but 3M's products... I thought Mr. Justice Rehnquist was saying if they were taxed, wouldn't they be identical to the tax on paper and ink here at issue."
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,774.367,783.306,"Now, would you apply that to Minnesota Mining's advertising?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,798.233,808.688,"Your Honor, dealing with the tax here at issue, the statutory phrase that is pivotal is the phrase ""publications""."
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,865.025,867.308,"This tax would apply to a textbook manufacturer, too, would it not?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,867.308,867.977,No.
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,869.243,870.861,How about the West Publishing Company?
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,870.861,876.998,"--I think their products, Your Honor, wind up being taxed on the sales at retail."
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,885.438,893.442,"Well, West Publishing Company must use almost as much ink and pulp as most of the newspapers, don't they?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,893.442,894.794,"Substantial, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.816,914.188,"Well, the case was judged in the Minnesota Supreme Court on the basis... was upheld on the basis that it just applied to newspapers."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,914.188,916.223,The Minnesota Supreme Court--
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.223,918.659,And only certain newspapers.
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,918.659,920.809,"--That's what they did, Judge."
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.615,934.852,"Well, that's the construction given of this statute by the Minnesota Supreme Court."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,934.852,938.054,--That seems to be what they tell us.
1982.81-1839,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,981.15,991.439,"Mr. Brown, would you hazard a guess as to why the Minnesota legislature imposed the $100,000 exemption?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,991.439,998.211,"Your Honor, any guess I would hazard would go beyond the record of this case."
1982.81-1839,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1035.986,1037.769,And 95 percent of it on two.
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1037.769,1041.704,"That's correct, Your Honor, the Minneapolis and St. Paul newspapers."
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.704,1057.4,"With respect to the Brainard and the Austin and the Mankato papers that apparently are also subject to the tax, would you say that they are a homogeneous class, if one can speak in those terms, with the Minneapolis and St. Paul dailies?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1057.4,1071.826,"I wouldn't call them homogeneous; I would call them competitors, because the circulation of the Twin Cities newspapers of Minneapolis and St. Paul extends throughout the state of Minnesota and into adjoining states."
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1094.589,1106.547,"But then I take it that you're not suggesting that there was anything other than an economic or tax-oriented, tax policy-oriented reason for the $100,000 cutoff."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1115.486,1117.705,I'm afraid I can't go that far.
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1159.415,1172.692,Is it a realistic proposition that a substantial majority of the Minnesota legislature have of the local newspapers that are not subject to this tax?
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1172.692,1178.511,"That's clearly the case with the makeup of the Minnesota legislative bodies, the Senate and the House, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1211.317,1217.72,"Well, of course, there are decisions that have so interpreted Grosjean, are there not?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1217.72,1226.409,"You're absolutely correct, Justice O'Connor, and to that extent I believe those lower court decisions have misinterpreted Grosjean."
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1343.051,1371.804,"Mr. Brown, I take it, then, that you adhere to what I think is your position that if the Minnesota legislature sits down and says 50 percent of our gross revenues are raised by sales/use tax combinations on people in business to make money, and we're looking at the present structure and we see there's a sales tax on almost every business entity in the state."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1403.958,1404.708,"We do, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1453.605,1463.08,But were those taxes on paper in England part of a scheme whereby sales and use of implements and products were generally taxed?
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1463.08,1464.497,"They were not, Your Honor, because--"
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.497,1466.031,"Well, isn't that quite a difference?"
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1466.031,1470.816,--Not really because prior to 1791 there were no sales or use taxes.
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1474.368,1474.97,"Well, true."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1504.824,1509.791,"Your Honor, my response, if you had a question within your response to my--"
1982.81-1839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1509.791,1511.227,"Well, it was something of a rhetorical question."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1511.227,1514.429,--My response nonetheless would be this.
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.343,1548.334,"Mr. Brown, you did seem to indicate that both the sales tax on the newspapers and this tax at issue here would be invalid."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1553.304,1555.256,"--You could, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.224,1563.259,"That's right, that's certainly right."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1571.93,1572.68,That's correct.
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.482,1582.969,You're entitled probably to pass it on.
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1586.338,1587.921,That is correct.
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.579,1610.119,"So I don't know why you wouldn't argue that even if the sales tax would be valid, this tax is invalid."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1610.119,1611.753,"--Well, we do argue that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.556,1643.608,"Mr. Brown, let me be sure I understand your answer to Justice Rehnquist's question."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1659.284,1661.219,"--Your Honor, our position is this."
1982.81-1839,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.219,1663.171,And leaving out the exemption for a moment.
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1663.171,1663.854,All right.
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.934,1737.052,"Mr. Brown, you sound like you're making an intergovernmental immunity argument."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1737.052,1738.386,"I don't mean to, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.386,1743.873,"Anyway, it's understandable, against that background."
1982.81-1839,0,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,1743.873,1755.264,"It's a difficult issue when you talk about a sales tax of general, non-discriminatory application and the position that the newspapers may take at some point in time in the future."
1982.81-1839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1767.989,1769.858,Very well.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,1774.575,1780.895,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1956.226,1962.312,"Mr. Attorney General, if it was a revenue-raising act, why leave out all those newspapers?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,1962.312,1969.585,"--Your Honor, the $100,000 exclusion was, admittedly, not for a revenue-raising purpose."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.226,2035.611,Who has paid the tax?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2036.895,2042.081,"On this record, Your Honor, we only have evidence that the newspapers have paid the tax."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.081,2043.383,"Well, that's all, isn't it?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2045.35,2047.068,"No, not necessarily, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.935,2059.81,"Didn't the Minnesota Supreme Court judge this case on the basis that this was just a tax on newspapers who consumed more than $100,000?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2059.81,2060.426,--No.
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.491,2086.96,You just told me that there wasn't any evidence that anybody but newspapers paid the tax.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2087.895,2090.431,"--The evidence is the basic statute itself, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.431,2092.664,--What's the evidence that other publications have paid it?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2092.664,2094.847,"There was no evidence, Your Honor, and we did not submit any."
1982.81-1839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.686,2121.164,"When Justice White asks you about evidence that other publications paid the tax, do you interpret that to mean evidence from the receipts department of the Taxation Division to the effect that they had receipts from such-and-such a taxpayer, or whether the tax is intended to cover other publications?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2121.164,2131.205,"I take it that Justice White's question... and correct me if I'm wrong, Justice White,... is that the evidence is that particular taxpayers other than newspapers did pay this tax."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.805,2136.943,My question was directed... the submission is that this is a tax on newspapers.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2136.943,2140.228,"--The submission by the Star Tribune, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.228,2142.847,And no one else pays this tax.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2155.987,2156.754,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.754,2171.18,"And I suppose the next question is with the exclusion of the $100,000, who else but newspapers consumes that much paper and ink?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2171.18,2175.401,I think the example that was previously given of 3M and its advertising certainly--
1982.81-1839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.401,2176.584,"That would probably be the biggest, wouldn't they?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2178.603,2190.078,"--West Publishing Company, Your Honor, does not... their end product, their books that the West Publishing Company prints, their end product is subject to sales tax at the retail level and, therefore, is not considered a publication."
1982.81-1839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.078,2194.362,But it does use as much paper and ink as a newspaper does.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2194.362,2195.33,"Oh, it certainly does, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.314,2197.33,I should think so.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2197.33,2212.84,"And the paper and ink that is used by West Publishing is already being subjected... was already being subjected to the sales tax itself, because the end product, the books of West Publishing Company, were subjected to the retail sales tax."
1982.81-1839,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2243.795,2251.282,"Under Minnesota law, do you agree that the sales tax where it's imposed is passed on to the purchaser?"
1982.81-1839,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2251.282,2253.317,Is that a requirement?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2253.317,2255.436,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.436,2257.753,And it may not be absorbed.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2257.753,2259.804,The sales tax may not be absorbed.
1982.81-1839,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2271.378,2274.83,But there's also no requirement that it be passed on.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2274.83,2278.266,"No, Your Honor, that's up to the commercial publication in their own discretion."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.266,2284.872,May I ask a question... I may not have followed... on what a publication is within the meaning of the statute.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2290.29,2291.623,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2309.518,2310.953,Wouldn't that encompass West?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2310.953,2316.857,"No, Your Honor, because most West books do not come out at average intervals of three months or less."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.857,2319.457,"They come out a lot faster than that, as far as I can see."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2320.225,2320.725,No.
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.521,2341.223,"And besides, isn't it subject to the sales tax?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2341.223,2342.073,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.073,2349.143,"Well, the term A77 of the... I guess I just must have just misread it."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2354.131,2370.323,"I think a greater definition, Your Honor, perhaps in less formal statutory language can be found in the Minnesota regulation dealing with the statute, which is found in JA 30, the Joint Appendix."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.81,2384.65,Does that include any publication that is subject to a sales tax on the end result?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2384.65,2386.602,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.42,2444.204,"Of course, that really is irrelevant, isn't it."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2444.204,2444.888,"Oh, yes."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.888,2447.14,"If your position is right, you could have imposed the full 4 percent."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2447.14,2448.64,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2517.15,2521.018,Has the legislature made any changes since this litigation began?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2521.018,2522.135,"--No, it hasn't, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.05,2552.471,"Mr. Attorney General, suppose instead of an $8000 credit or a $4000 credit, you gave them, say, a $25,000 credit."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2555.525,2556.541,"--Well, the--"
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2556.541,2557.925,Would that be constitutional?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2557.925,2574.003,"--I think the decisions of this Court, Your Honor, I don't think necessarily take it that on a general law that would otherwise be valid imposing valid classifications, is necessarily unconstitutional because it applies to only one person."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.003,2581.823,"In Illinois they have a practice of exempting all counties under 500,000 from a lot, which is a way of legislating about Chicago."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2593.031,2595.833,"Well, that's true, Your Honor, but that happens in a lot of cases."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.795,2613.528,"Well, what about my question?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2617.681,2619.532,"I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.532,2628.204,"The question is if the exemption or the credit, whatever you call it, instead of being $4000 was $35,000, so the only two left were the papers in Minneapolis and St. Paul."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2628.204,2630.656,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it would still be constitutional."
1982.81-1839,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.724,2668.281,Do you think the court in Grosjean would have reached the same result absent Huey Long's activities in Louisiana at that time?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2668.281,2677.22,"I think assuming... I think the result in Grosjean, Your Honor, was a result of many factors."
1982.81-1839,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2710.756,2720.38,Do you think this Court has to look at the potential for abuse or control of the press in the tax scheme in determining its validity?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2720.38,2723.249,"I think that's true to a certain extent, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2783.371,2792.576,"Of course, in your state you have no formal legislative history ever, do you?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2792.576,2793.41,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2802.016,2803.634,"It would be helpful sometimes if they did, I think."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2803.634,2806.753,"That's true, Your Honor, if they had the money to do so."
1982.81-1839,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2830.268,2831.351,Some states do.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2831.351,2832.57,"Some states do, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2833.67,2836.689,Why would it be particularly difficult for New Hampshire?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2836.689,2843.009,"Oh, I just mentioned that, Your Honor, because they're very much... I was reading an article recently about--"
1982.81-1839,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2843.009,2845.859,Their assembly has 400 members.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2845.859,2850.579,"--Yes, it's a large assembly, Your Honor, and they don't like taxes in New Hampshire."
1982.81-1839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.346,2909.467,"I don't understand your position to be... I understand the position to be that in England, the first set of taxes were very inocuous and they went on and on and on."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2926.496,2932.983,"That may be the Star Tribune's argument, that's true, Your Honor, but I don't believe that the history of the taxes on knowledge would support that."
1982.81-1839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.983,2935.102,I only said I thought that was their position.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,2935.102,2935.935,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3040.954,3043.74,But let me just explore your argument for a moment.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3064.737,3066.704,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.907,3072.74,Then go back to 71.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3092.621,3097.875,"I would suggest, Your Honor, that this Court could use the Grosjean decision and invalidate that tax, then."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.875,3103.612,"So we have to get into the politics of the particular state to know whether a tax of this kind is bad or not, then."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3103.612,3106.231,"At least the legislative history; not necessarily the politics, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.727,3131.446,Could I ask just one other question about this motive problem.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3155.462,3157.812,You mean they passed a general sales tax on all businesses?
1982.81-1839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.812,3158.012,--Right.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3164.216,3170.036,"Well, I think that would be a closer case, Your Honor, and I can only say that it's not the case here."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.828,3339.898,"At what level does the sales tax normally cut in... a penny for every dime, or is it?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3339.898,3344.034,"I don't recall the actual level now in Minnesota, Your Honor, but--"
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.034,3346.867,Do you think you pay a sales tax if you buy something for 20 cents?
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3346.867,3347.102,--It was at 9 cents or--
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.342,3365.28,But do you think... you think the newspapers are normally sold at a level that's above the cutoff.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3365.28,3366.33,"I know they are, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.399,3377.421,"And anytime you buy something for 25 cents, unless it's exempt, you pay a sale tax."
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3377.421,3378.338,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.928,3419.432,"What's your... that's easy to talk about the special needs of small newspapers, but what is that?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3419.432,3421.282,"A small newspaper, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3421.282,3421.682,Yes.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3425.336,3427.002,"Most small newspapers, Your Honor, are--"
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.002,3428.252,"You mean mainly, they couldn't afford it?"
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3428.252,3430.171,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.682,3448.215,It was purely a financial break to them.
1982.81-1839,1,38059,paul_r_kempainen,,3448.215,3449.467,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3506.602,3509.304,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Brown?"
1982.81-1839,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3513.775,3515.275,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1839,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3604.366,3605.285,That isn't really quite right.
1982.81-1839,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3609.737,3612.237,--The Cloverleaf case.
1982.81-1839,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3612.237,3612.453,--Yes.
1982.81-1839,2,34145,lawrence_c_brown,,3615.641,3624.378,"Your Honor, what that proves is when the Minnesota legislature wants this Court to have legislative history, it knows how to create it."
1982.81-1839,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3651.314,3653.264,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
