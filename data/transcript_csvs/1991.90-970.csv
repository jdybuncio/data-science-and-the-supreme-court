1991.90-970,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.789,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-970, Lechmere, Inc., v. National Labor Relations Board."
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,20.913,24.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.077,255.429,"Big hard-hearted employer, isn't it?"
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,257.029,265.385,"--Your Honor, I would respond by saying that it's an indication of just how strongly this employer has asserted its private property interest."
1991.90-970,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,347.539,348.989,Is that true of all of them?
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,348.989,351.891,"It was true of most of them, Your Honor."
1991.90-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.878,413.362,Excuse me.
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,414.98,416.247,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.247,419.782,"But they still couldn't reach them there, right, unless... unless they went onto the land?"
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,419.782,432.608,"They... they could not walk up and touch them, Your Honor, but they certainly, within 4 feet, a distance greater than separates you and I, could beckon them to come over, all the while saying, I have a piece of literature here that you should be interested in."
1991.90-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.749,446.785,Every car was 4 feet from this--
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,446.785,473.352,"--No, Your Honor, but the... the length of property that bordered on Berlin Turnpike was several hundred feet in length, and the employees, while they all didn't, in one single line, up against that section of public land, park, nonetheless, I think that the testimony indicates that there may have been only two or three rows of cars, but certainly that first row of cars was within 4 feet."
1991.90-970,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,481.106,485.743,--I do hope you will expound the alternatives that were available.
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,485.743,487.626,"Yes, Your Honor, and I will do that now."
1991.90-970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.493,639.093,Mr. Joy--
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,639.093,639.776,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1991.90-970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,639.776,648.599,"--The... the board found, I gather, that there were no feasible and effective alternatives to going on the property."
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,648.599,657.269,"That's correct, the board so found, Your Honor, and I would submit to you that they applied an erroneous legal standard in defining what reasonable alternative means were."
1991.90-970,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,853.032,860.019,"Did the board explain, Mr. Joy, why it dismissed the mass media as a possible means of communication?"
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,860.019,874.028,"--It said, Your Honor, that in most cases it will be considered expensive or ineffective, and I believe that's further indication that they misconstrue the word effective to mean, effective in persuading as opposed to effective in reaching."
1991.90-970,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.756,1053.06,And what rule of law do you say has been violated by the board?
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,1053.06,1071.956,The... the board has taken the... mandated the required threshold inquiry into whether reasonable alternative means are available to reach the intended audience before we have to consider when and how much trespass is necessary.
1991.90-970,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1085.115,1097.523,"Would... would you agree that because the word reasonable is in there, it's perfectly appropriate for them to consider the strength of the property right and consider the particularity of the section 7 right acquired?"
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,1108.062,1122.971,"Our proposition, Justice Souter, is that before any analysis of the strength of the property right versus the strength of the section 7 right in question is to be engaged in, the threshold inquiry must first be asked and answered."
1991.90-970,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1122.971,1129.375,"Yeah, but the word reasonable is in there, and what are they supposed to consider when they... when they... when they inquire about reasonableness?"
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,1145.4,1159.56,"Your Honor, allow me to respond by saying that we read the word reasonable in that context to mean reasonable in light and in the context of the remainder of the opinion... excuse me."
1991.90-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.718,1224.42,And you'd... you'd say expense has some bearing as to reasonable.
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,1237.144,1254.539,"I'm not submitting to the Court, Justice Scalia, that as an absolute rule expense is prohibited from consideration, but using an objective reasonable standard as applied to facts such as you present, certainly cost may be one factor."
1991.90-970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1256.372,1282.956,"Mr. Joy, in... in Textile Workers v. Darlington Company, a case decided here after Babcock, I don't find a recitation of the structure that you say Babcock established, that you have to determine initially whether there are reasonable alternatives before you can weigh the business justification against the section 7 rights."
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,1293.978,1318.11,"--I don't believe, Your Honor, that Darlington involved the situation where nonemployees were part of the factual scenario of the case, but let me cite you to Sears & Roebuck, and the quotation appears on page 18, and this follows up to your comment on my earlier comment that subsequent decisions have tended to bolster rather than diminish the vitality of Babcock & Wilcox."
1991.90-970,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1375.463,1385.652,Do you think the board has changed the test from whether there are reasonable alternatives to whether there are reasonable and effective alternatives?
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,1385.652,1412.988,"--Effective in persuading, Your Honor, and I would cite to you the board's own language in Jean Country, which says that, most significantly, in determining the factors that we will look at in assessing reasonable alternative means, most significantly, Your Honor, is the extent to which exclusive use of the nontrespassory alternatives would dilute the effectiveness of the message."
1991.90-970,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1414.772,1418.29,"Well, the whole purpose of the communication is... is to... is to persuade--"
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,1418.29,1419.559,"--Correct, your Honor."
1991.90-970,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1419.559,1430.866,--and it... it seems to me not a stretch at all to say that reasonableness and an evaluation of reasonableness includes an assessment of how effective the communication is going to be.
1991.90-970,0,39619,robert_p_joy,,1439.103,1459.283,"Your Honor, I would in response to your question say that the Babcock command which struck this construction of the act and erected this analytical regime required that only reaching... only whether the alternative means was effective in reaching the audience."
1991.90-970,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.626,1601.459,"Very well, Mr. Joy."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1603.261,1606.479,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.867,1716.7,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, you're talking about an abstract proposition, which of course you have to talk about in a case like this, but there is a remarkable similarity to the layout, it seems to me, of Babcock & Wilcox and to the layout of this particular organization, yet in Babcock & Wilcox this Court said the board could not require nonemployee access, and in this case the board says yes, we can require nonemployee access."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1716.7,1728.425,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the facts in Babcock were quite different than the facts in this case, despite the fact that both cases involve parking lots and both cases involve organizational activity."
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.056,1759.044,I think the Court in Babcock emphasized that condition of the property.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1765.364,1775.037,"--No, the Babcock decision itself does not discuss the weight to be accorded to the property interest because of its characteristics--"
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.037,1775.656,Yes.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1775.656,1788.23,--But I think that would be a mistake for this Court to read Babcock as having decided every possible case that could come before the board in the future without regard to significant factual distinctions.
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.265,1807.175,"Well, do you think the board would be making a mistake under Babcock if they said it doesn't make any difference whether the media are available, or whether the telephone is available, or anything like that?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1807.175,1807.908,--Yes.
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.649,1821.768,"Well, they... even, even if going on the property would be more effective?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1821.768,1822.201,--That's right.
1991.90-970,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1865.778,1874.551,"Well, is the board's position that the instruments of the mass media are less effective means of communication today than they were when Babcock was decided in 1956?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1874.551,1880.89,"Well... well, in Babcock this Court never adverted to the availability of mass media as an alternative means."
1991.90-970,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.685,1939.076,"No, but in this... in this setting, Mr. Dreeben, the... on the... the people who are standing on the grassy strip could have held up a big sign saying there's going to be an organizational meeting at the legion hall on a given night at a given time."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1982.252,1991.608,"No, I don't think that it is, Justice Souter, but from the outset, the point here is that the section 7 rights that are being protected are the rights of the employees."
1991.90-970,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2002.732,2013.207,"Yes, but you're not talking, though, about information, you're talking about effectiveness in persuading them to get to a place where the information can be given if they want to receive it, isn't that fair to say?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2013.207,2021.044,"Well, I... I don't think that it's fair to say that the board looks at whether the... the information that the employees receive is persuasive to them."
1991.90-970,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2031.769,2037.073,And will talk with them at a specific time and place if they are willing to go there.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2037.073,2038.139,--Well--
1991.90-970,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2038.139,2040.375,That's more than just the picketing did.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2046.778,2056.367,"--Well, I don't think that this Court had in mind, even in Babcock, that the only thing the union had to be able to do was announce its existence."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.156,2070.794,"Even if they don't want to, you say that they must be given this information, even if they don't want the information?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2070.794,2071.294,"Well, with the--"
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2071.294,2075.496,"Even though it's only employees' rights... as you say, section 7 is only rights of employees."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2083.185,2084.368,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.368,2092.373,"And you say that they have a right... a right to receive information, even information they don't want to receive, and we're going to sort of force-feed them."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2093.957,2097.861,"Well, it's not clear that they don't want to receive the information."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.861,2098.877,"Well, yes, it is."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2104.179,2111.918,"No, I don't think that it is adequate, because it doesn't allow them to have any opportunity, it doesn't allow them to be confronted with the facts that may influence--"
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.918,2113.018,Which they don't want to hear.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2113.018,2120.94,"--Well, they may ultimately not want to hear it, even if the employees simply get the opportunity to receive the information from the union."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.716,2140.251,It seems to me if we're talking about employee's rights... and that's how the statute reads.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2161.149,2170.188,"Well, this Court has recognized that it is a literal interference with the employees' ability to get information if the employer prevents someone from handing them a handbill."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.988,2204.011,"Because it... because it had been delivered through... through trespass, because the people who passed it out had no right to be on the... on the property."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2204.011,2205.844,"Well, that... that's the issue in this case, whether they had a right to--"
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.844,2206.427,Of course it is.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2206.427,2218.169,"--Federal law does give the employees the right to organize, and this Court has recognized that in order meaningfully to exercise that right there's a need for the employees to be addressed by organizers."
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.871,2233.613,"Well, Mr. Dreeben... Mr. Dreeben, I take it if the... let's assume the employer said, I will distribute to every single one of my employees this notice of the union meeting and the purpose of the meeting."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2237.398,2238.398,"--Well, I don't think that--"
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.398,2239.767,Yes or no.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2239.767,2244.235,"--Well, I'm not sure what the board would say about that question."
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.235,2244.669,You don't?
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2247.104,2251.741,"I think that the board should look at the actual facts of the situation, but I don't think--"
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.741,2263.382,"Well, the fact is, the employer makes sure every single employee knows what... that there's a meeting and that the union wants to give them some information about how valuable it is to belong to a union."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2263.382,2267.084,"--Well, I don't think that the act contemplates that the employer should be the vehicle for this--"
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.084,2272.588,"I know, but it just so happens the employer is willing to do that just to avoid a lot of hassle."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2272.588,2279.142,"--Well, that is not likely to be a way that the employees are going to receive the undiluted message of what the union has to say."
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.142,2290.533,"So you say that would not be enough, the board would be entitled to say that that is not a reasonably effective alternative way of communicating."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2290.533,2293.235,I... I'm not sure what the board would say about that.
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.385,2311.446,"Well, what would you say if the employer went a little step farther and said look, I'm going to... I'm going to distribute to every single employee a notice of this meeting, and then I'm going to add to it a little paragraph that the union will write for me about how great it is to be a member of the union."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2325.623,2330.241,--I think that that's a very significant component of what the board is looking at.
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.907,2331.674,"Well, your answer is yes, I guess."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2338.328,2343.899,"--In an organizing setting, either in person or by the... over the telephone would likely be a necessity."
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.203,2351.07,"No, not if the employees said, don't do it."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2351.07,2357.891,"--Well, there's... there's certainly... this is not... this doesn't raise the case in which the employee said, don't do it."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.799,2372.751,And calling to them from a grass strip is not in person?
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2379.805,2385.309,"Well, that is... there's nothing in the record to show that that actually happened in this case."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.385,2400.618,"That might... right, but I mean that might have been an unfair labor practice."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2417.03,2419.982,"Well, I... I think a personal conversation does constitute one."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.636,2442.245,"I... I think what it goes to is... I do think you're saying what the board desires, and that is that there be more than just an opportunity afforded to the employee either in person or by advertisement to get information that the employee wants."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2454.952,2469.712,"I think that... that whether there is or isn't adequate access is something that depends on particular facts, and... and it could well be that in a particular case the board would find that access from public property to the employees was certainly good enough."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.712,2471.928,"Well, that isn't the point, whether it's access from public property."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2483.469,2489.089,"I don't think that's what this Court said was enough access, even in the Babcock case."
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.003,2509.953,But communicating what?
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2517.275,2518.008,Sure.
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.612,2527.398,--So that presumably would work from the parking lot as well.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2533.368,2538.189,--If the... if the union actually has the opportunity to talk to the employees.
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.189,2544.26,"Holding up a sign, though, I want to talk to you about the union, and the person says, I don't want to hear it, that... that's... that doesn't work."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2544.26,2577.481,"Well, I think the board has the right to make the judgment that that's not going to be a reasonably effective way for the employees to even understand what the union wants to talk to them about, and that is, after all, what the board's mission is in this case, and when the Court spoke of the accommodation of interests in the Hudgens case, it had in mind that the board would take into account the character of the property and the kind of section 7 right and question in deciding whether there was adequate protection of the section 7 right in question."
1991.90-970,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2577.481,2601.346,"Mr. Dreeben, do you think that Babcock & Wilson stands for the proposition that it is a two-tier inquiry, that you first have to determine whether there are reasonable alternatives to the trespass in order to contact the employees, and only if the answer to that is no would you go on?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2601.346,2612.618,"I don't think, Justice O'Connor, that Babcock structures the inquiry so that the board is precluded from doing what it does here, which is considering the reasonableness of alternatives in conjunction--"
1991.90-970,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2612.618,2613.987,As part of the overall balance.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2613.987,2614.687,--That... that's correct.
1991.90-970,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2614.687,2615.654,That is what the board does.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2615.654,2616.439,That is what the board does.
1991.90-970,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2621.158,2624.61,But it doesn't consider that first or separately.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2624.61,2648.558,"It does consider it separately in the sense that if there are reasonable alternatives available, that's the end of the case, but the board does not view that as a factor in isolation from other factors, and I would suggest that's exactly what this Court recognized that the board might do in Hudgens v. NLRB, where it spoke of the accommodation as falling as... on points along a spectrum."
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2666.62,2683.648,"Well, I... under Jean I would think that it may be that alternatives would be reasonable, considered reasonable in one case and unreasonable in another, depending on the degree of intrusion on the property?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2683.648,2684.448,That's correct.
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.135,2697.622,So you are balancing the reasonableness against the degree of intrusion.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2697.622,2703.812,What the board is balancing is how much section 7 rights will suffer against how much property rights will suffer.
1991.90-970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2703.812,2717.786,"Mr. Dreeben, in the... the board's order here required, as I understand it, the employer to allow access to the parking lot for the purpose of distributing handbills and leaflets to the employees."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2733.331,2736.283,"Well, I think that there's... there's aspects of both."
1991.90-970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2736.283,2751.626,"Because one... one would think that if... if your requirement that it be a personal contact is uppermost in the board's mind, that putting it on the windshield or sticking it in somebody's seat is not certainly most people's definition of that sort of personal contact."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2751.626,2758.363,"Well, what the board is doing is deciding whether there was an unfair labor practice with respect to the employer's conduct in this case."
1991.90-970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2780.393,2783.412,"Or even a personal contact, as you earlier spoke of."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2783.412,2786.33,--It's not insisting that that be the case at all.
1991.90-970,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2797.088,2811.764,"Well, it... it seems to me that if... if we affirm the board here, in effect there will be a general rule that absent some special circumstances union organizers always have access to an employer's parking lot."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2811.764,2817.151,"No, I don't think that... that the rule, Justice Kennedy, would be absent special circumstances."
1991.90-970,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2822.722,2830.559,"Well, in most cases it's going to advertising, telephone, and I don't see how the run-of-the-mill case would really be much different than what we have here."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2831.559,2844.2,"--No it isn't, because many kinds of facilities will have public property where the employees enter, and there will be an opportunity for the union to make contact with the employees before they get on the employer's property."
1991.90-970,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2844.2,2861.178,"But it seems to me that in almost any conventional suburban shopping mall or shopping center context that the general rule would have to be that there's access to the parking lot, even if the employer owns it and controls it."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2861.178,2862.044,"Well, I--"
1991.90-970,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.044,2869.85,"I just don't see how to... I'm not saying that's an unreasonable rule, but it seems to me that that's the necessary thrust of this decision."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2869.85,2889.146,"--I think the thrust of this decision is that the board is entitled to take into account the fact that a parking lot is essentially open to the public and that the infringement on the employer's property interest in allowing a small amount of peaceful, quiet organizational activity is not a substantial infringement."
1991.90-970,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2889.146,2893.132,I... I agree that that's a fair assessment of what the board has done here.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2893.132,2894.265,And... and what the board--
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.265,2917.748,"Mr. Dreeben, may I... Justice Kennedy may not think it's not... it's not an unreasonable rule, but hasn't the Court suggested that it would be an unreasonable rule in the... in the language from Sears that your colleague referred us to, where... where we did seem to establish... it's dictum, to be sure, but it reflects our understanding of Babcock & Wilcox."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2946.048,2946.931,"--No, Justice Scalia, I don't--"
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.931,2950.466,--not say that the burden is rarely in favor of trespassory activity.
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2950.466,2958.387,"--Well, I don't think that what the Court was doing in Sears was attempting to foreordain how the board might apply the act in future cases."
1991.90-970,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.739,3121.528,"May I ask you, on the newspapers, does the record show whether these were home-delivered papers, or were they suburban papers that are delivered in large blocks to different places like stores?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3121.528,3123.245,The record doesn't show that.
1991.90-970,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3133.652,3134.685,What were the other two papers?
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3135.937,3138.57,"--I don't know, and I'm not sure that the record shows that."
1991.90-970,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3138.57,3143.008,"You don't know whether they're even... they're throw-aways, or there was a... you know, they had to pay for them."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3152.53,3153.196,Yes.
1991.90-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3173.092,3179.68,"Mr. Dreeben, make sure I... is this an unfair characterization of what I think the board is saying?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3214.252,3216.502,"In essence, Justice Scalia, that is correct."
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.73,3239.533,"This is hardly the way Babcock reads, is it?"
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3239.533,3240.533,"Well, I--"
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3240.533,3249.306,"You would think under Babcock there was just some concept of reasonable alternative ways of communicating, which you talk about, and it's a constant."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3249.306,3256.412,--I don't think that Babcock can be read as answering all of the questions that the board--
1991.90-970,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3256.412,3262.749,"Well, I agree with that, but I take it you disagree with my characterization of Babcock in this respect."
1991.90-970,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3262.749,3263.633,"--Yes, I do."
1991.90-970,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3301.624,3301.824,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1991.90-970,2,39619,robert_p_joy,,3304.893,3307.195,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-970,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.185,3344.285,And he excluded every other kind of a--
1991.90-970,2,39619,robert_p_joy,,3344.285,3346.003,"Indeed he did, Your Honor."
1991.90-970,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3346.003,3346.553,--Of a--
1991.90-970,2,39619,robert_p_joy,,3346.553,3356.195,He excluded every other trespasser who came on to his property to engage in activity inconsistent with its commercial use.
1991.90-970,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.24,3405.925,--Do you have any courts of appeals that agree with you?
1991.90-970,2,39619,robert_p_joy,,3405.925,3409.21,"Your Honor, I can distinguish the courts of appeals cases that--"
1991.90-970,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.21,3410.329,But the answer is no.
1991.90-970,2,39619,robert_p_joy,,3410.329,3418.935,"--The answer is no, Your Honor, but Jean Country, if I may, has never been squarely challenged as has been done in the Lechmere case."
