2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,7.386,"We'll hear argument in number 05-184, Hamdan against Rumsfeld."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,9.674,11.752,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.126,156.575,Where was that change made from the prior version?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,156.575,159.946,--The change was made between November 10th and November 15th.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.946,161.868,"Yes, but, I mean, what... it was made in what house?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,163.462,164.806,It was made in the Senate.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.806,166.066,It was made in the Senate.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,169.521,170.265,That--
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.265,170.915,--language.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,170.915,171.609,--That's correct.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,171.609,174.214,"And the President, who signed this bill, never saw the prior language."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,174.214,174.714,That is correct.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,174.714,182.861,"So, why should we attribute to both the House and to the President a knowledge of the prior version of the legislation?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,182.861,188.82,"Well, because the language itself was, I think, the subject of an immense amount of debate."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.925,191.791,In the Senate.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,191.791,192.952,--In the Senate.
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,239.311,239.811,But isn't that--
2005.05-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.811,245.687,"What, in addition to this case... I mean, this case is pending in the U.S. Supreme Court."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,255.011,271.818,"We believe that, as the cosponsor said, on November 15th when they introduce the final version of the language, that all of those cases are grandfathered with respect to the H(1) effective date provision and the E(1) jurisdiction stripping provision."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.141,324.835,Please go over that again.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,328.023,328.539,Okay.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.539,336.77,"You say that it could be read to preclude cases in the lower courts, but not here."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,336.77,352.399,"That's right, cases in which there is a final CSRT decision; that is, that the Government's argument in the D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, is that there are two different ways in which the DTA truncated the review of Guantanamo cases."
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,380.191,403.973,"Does that mean, in practical terms, that the... that the... that the other claims that are in the District Court get transferred to the Circuit, the Circuit is bound by the limitations that you've just described, and, at the end of the day, the complaining parties in those cases can raise the question whether they... whether Congress could properly have truncated them, as it did, but it's simply got to wait?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,403.973,404.639,--Absolutely.
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,404.805,405.122,Okay.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,405.122,408.01,"--to be clear, that's not the position we're saying that is the DTA."
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.354,409.504,I realize--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,409.504,409.837,That's the issue--
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.837,410.07,--Yes.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,410.07,412.08,"--below, in the D.C. Circuit."
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,473.323,478.782,--Why does it... why does it affect the scope of the review that he could get eventually?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,494.995,500.871,"--Well, as the Government says, it does... certainly does not encompass question 2, because it eliminates the word ""treaties""."
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,541.786,545.901,"I mean, criminal litigation review after the final decision is the general rule."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,567.162,574.459,"Justice Scalia... Justice Alito, if this were a final... if this were like a criminal proceeding, we wouldn't be here."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.558,716.883,Could I come back to Justice Alito's question as to what the normal procedure would be in criminal cases?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,736.115,736.876,I don't believe so.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.876,743.514,"So, there would be nothing different in this situation, if you couldn't raise it until it was final."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,743.514,746.618,"Justice Scalia, everything is different about this."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.62,757.786,"Oh, I know."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,757.786,758.636,--matter--
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.636,759.469,It goes to the merits of the issue.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,761.49,765.356,"--Well, I do think that there's an integral relationship to the... between the two."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.352,803.405,"Well, when you say Congress hasn't fairly balanced it, I mean, I guess that depends upon your reading of the statute."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,818.274,818.84,But--
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.84,822.222,"I mean, it's sort of a... you know, a... you're running in a circle."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,822.222,836.429,"--Well, that's precisely, Justice Scalia, our argument, that I don't think one can consider the abstention claim... and this is what I believe both courts below have held... you can't consider the abstention claim without deciding the underlying merits."
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.706,894.834,"Mr. Katyal, will you help me?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,897.572,902.781,"--The charge itself, Justice Stevens, is found at 63(a) of the Petition appendix."
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.781,903.875,"Okay, thank you very much."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,903.875,904.458,Sure.
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,905.137,919.243,"And suppose you had a tribunal that was properly constituted, as you contend that it ought to be, and then the charge was conspiracy."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,940.082,944.964,"--Ordinarily, Justice Kennedy, the answer would be no, you wouldn't challenge the validity of the charge."
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.958,1009.544,"Could the tribunal interpret the conspiracy charge to mean joint enterprise, which would be closer, at least, to accepted practice in the international tribunals?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1009.544,1012.91,The charge itself is one of conspiracy.
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1029.21,1041.54,"I'm still not sure why, if we think that there is merit to your argument that the tribunal is not properly established anyway, that you... we have to reach the conspiracy charge."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1041.54,1041.873,--If you--
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1041.873,1048.182,"And if we... and if we think that you're wrong on that, I don't know why that court can't hear the conspiracy argument."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1048.182,1050.604,"--Well, there's two different reasons."
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1072.703,1073.369,"Well, that's--"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1073.369,1074.297,--in a military commission.
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1074.297,1082.027,"--Mr. Katyal, I mean, that's a good argument for... from a broad policy, but isn't there a narrower reason?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1132.257,1132.857,You are--
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1132.857,1133.29,Or do you like that answer.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1133.29,1134.456,"--absolutely correct, Justice--"
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1134.456,1134.717,Okay.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1134.717,1134.967,--Souter.
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1165.796,1166.446,But is it clear that the--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1166.446,1166.946,--there's two different problems.
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1166.946,1169.384,--charges against your client could not be amended?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1169.384,1174.249,"They may be amended, yes."
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1174.249,1181.069,"Then why should we... why should there be review, before trial, of a charge that could be amended?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1181.069,1181.646,Be--
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1181.646,1185.595,There could be additional charges added by the time there's a final decision.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1185.595,1193.166,"--And the... Justice Alito, the Government has had, essentially, now 4 years to get their charges together on Mr. Hamdan."
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1232.576,1236.192,Isn't this contrary to the way legal proceedings and appeals are normally handled?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1243.728,1254.315,"Not in... not here, because, as, I think, both courts below indicated, this case, and his challenge, falls very much like Abney versus United States."
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.664,1331.108,May I ask this question about the charge?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1351.102,1352.774,"It is clear, Justice Stevens."
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1381.165,1394.689,"Well, suppose that proof were to show that there was very substantial and knowing involvement rendering him basically an accomplice or a principal, but it was... it was still found under conspiracy."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1396.449,1396.983,--If the--
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1396.983,1405.297,Assume that he's been given notice of... during the... during the course of the proceedings as to what the charges specifically are as the proof is adduced.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1405.297,1417.66,"--Justice Kennedy, on this particular point, on conspiracy, yes, if... that you couldn't charge some other offense, like aiding and abetting, and transmute some conspiracy charge into that."
2005.05-184,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1496.714,1497.624,"Well, that wouldn't be--"
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.624,1498.158,"Well, let me put it this way."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1516.191,1520.723,"Well, it is the role of this Court to confine the tribunal to its lawful jurisdiction."
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1530.048,1540.134,"Well, suppose we told the D.C. Circuit that the Geneva Convention or some other body of international law controls, and just remand to it for it to go into all these arguments?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1540.134,1550.642,"Again, we think, at this point, that the public interest is best served by this Court saying that conspiracy doesn't violate... to set some limits."
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.088,1566.504,May I ask--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1566.504,1566.704,--for this case--
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.704,1567.12,--this question?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1590.303,1595.845,"--If the charge is the specific offenses themselves, not aiding and abetting, Justice Stevens--"
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.845,1600.388,"Well, the specific offenses are attacking civilians and attacking civilian objects."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1600.388,1606.097,"--Yes, with respect to this particular claim about conspiracy, that would solve that problem."
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.677,1614.927,And then--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1614.927,1615.377,--yes.
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.377,1623.57,"--what if the trial judge who looked at the indictment or ruling on a motion to dismiss the indictment, or its equivalent at this time... said,"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1631.717,1639.698,"That would mix apples and oranges, because ""conspiracy"" and ""aiding and abetting"" are two entirely different things."
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.74,1648.25,"But the language is ""conspired and agreed with""."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1651.649,1659.263,"--It's not, Justice Stevens, because it requires a different level of participation, and the liability is entirely different."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.588,1691.853,"As I recall the sixth amendment, you're entitled to know the charge against you."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1696.653,1697.664,That is correct.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.14,1777.706,You acknowledge the existence of things called commissions.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1778.966,1779.45,--We do.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.45,1779.916,I mean--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1779.916,1780.727,Absolutely.
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.727,1788.374,--What is the use of them if they have to follow all of the procedures required by the UCMJ?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1792.574,1795.762,"Justice Scalia, that's what the Government would like you to believe."
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1854.916,1859.281,"What fundamentals, other than personal presence, are you concerned with in this case?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1859.281,1859.598,--Well--
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1859.598,1859.931,Or is that it--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1859.931,1865.057,"--Well, we do believe that the... that the entire panoply of UCMJ protection--"
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1865.057,1865.824,--I understand--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1865.824,1866.734,--is involved.
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1866.734,1868.678,--the nature... the appointing authority and so forth.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1871.366,1872.11,Well--
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1872.11,1873.038,--just right to be present?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1879.598,1880.109,--Absolutely.
2005.05-184,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.725,1918.292,But if you have to--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1918.292,1918.736,--a simpler case--
2005.05-184,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.736,1924.362,"--approximately the same procedures, what's the point of having a military commission?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1933.359,1942.101,"--Well, we had them before, because... we had them before, because we couldn't find military court martial jurisdiction."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.92,2015.673,"Mr. Katyal, you've addressed the Detainee Treatment Act in its... in its capacity as, arguably, removing jurisdiction."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2025.915,2042.471,"Certainly, there's nothing in the text of the Act itself... and even... I know this isn't relevant for you, but for other individuals on the Court... there's nothing in the legislative history, or even the post... even the brief filed by Senators Graham and Kyle, which suggest, in any way, that this was ratification."
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.322,2079.01,"Do you think, as a minimum, that they authorized a military commission?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2079.01,2089.762,"They... I think it's perfectly... well, it's a... it's a... it is a possible reading to say the DTA authorized some sort of military commission."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.982,2193.42,"It depends on what you mean by ""regularly constituted""."
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2211.326,2219.707,"--Well, I think the way that it has been interpreted, ""regularly constituted court"", is not an ad hoc court with ad hoc rules."
2005.05-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.489,2226.521,"Well, I mean, not ad hoc in that sense,"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2242.816,2253.818,"--So long as it is, (a) independent of the executive, which is what it's been interpreted to be, and, (b) affords the rights known to civilized peoples."
2005.05-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2261.538,2268.602,You've mentioned... you've mentioned that the defendant has no right to appear before the tribunal.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2278.344,2286.075,"--So far, Justice Ginsburg, all that we have before... you know, I think all that's happened is the right to be present."
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2340.17,2343.458,How do you want us to view his status?
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2365.806,2368.562,"--No, Justice Kennedy, for two reasons."
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2368.562,2370.75,"I mean, in... particularly based on the CSRT hearing?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2370.75,2374.188,"The CSRT, to my knowledge, never asked any of those--"
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2374.188,2374.354,But you have to--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2374.354,2374.937,--questions about--
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2374.937,2375.698,--you have to give us--
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2375.698,2375.931,--uniforms or--
2005.05-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2375.931,2377.208,--a beginning point.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2378.902,2380.663,--We would love a beginning point.
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2433.575,2443.316,"And that would require a determination by a different tribunal that he was not a POW, in default of which he would be treated as a POW and be entitled to a court martial?"
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2444.033,2444.744,"--Yes, Justice--"
2005.05-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2444.744,2445.044,Yes.
2005.05-184,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2445.044,2445.494,--Souter.
2005.05-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.588,2447.532,"Yes, you certainly may."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2450.636,2454.068,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.727,2519.415,"But let me just ask this question, Mr. Clement."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2533.356,2537.221,"Well, what I would say, Justice Stevens, is, they basically enforce the laws of war."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.737,2562.608,And what we have here is enforcement of the laws of war.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2562.608,2564.78,That is right.
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.47,2580.908,If... just one hypothetical.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2592.827,2607.195,"--I think if you did that, Justice Stevens, it would present the very difficult question that this Court has never squarely addressed, which is, Does the President have some authority to try, by military commission, beyond that which Congress has joined him in?"
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.627,2629.71,"Well, if--"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2629.71,2630.293,--difficult issue.
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.293,2631.721,--It's easy if it is a war crime.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2641.973,2643.233,I think he--
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.233,2644.494,You think he could.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2644.494,2647.95,"--I think we would take the position that he could, as a matter of pure constitutional power."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2657.258,2664.655,"So, the basic position you're asserting is that we have... that the... this commission intends to try a violation of the laws of war."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2670.281,2671.114,Yes.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2728.408,2754.295,"What do you... what do you make of the argument that Mr. Katyal just alluded to, that if you take the... as you do... take the position that the commissions are operating under the laws of war, you've got to accept that one law of war here is the Geneva Convention right to a presumption of POW status unless there is a determination by a competent tribunal otherwise, with the... among other things, the rights that that carries."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2764.036,2781.836,"Well, Justice Souter, I don't think there's any frying pan effect or fire effect, precisely because what you have with respect to the claim that the Geneva Conventions applies... okay, that claim could be brought to the military commissions, but they could adjudicate it and say that the Geneva Conventions don't apply here, for any number of reasons."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2785.541,2794.949,"Well, but you're... are you saying that the... that the commission will adjudicate POW status under the Geneva Convention?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2809.867,2811.655,"--Well, I don't think so, Justice Souter."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2822.324,2825.696,"Well, do you agree that it applies as part of the law of war?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2825.696,2832.466,"--Well, I don't think, consistent with the position of the executive, that the Geneva Convention applies in this particular conflict."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2832.466,2834.837,"But that, I guess, is the problem that I'm having."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2858.947,2860.457,"We're not trying to have it both ways, Justice Souter."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2868.455,2875.175,"But he is entitled to make a claim under them to determine whether, on the merits, he is entitled."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2877.263,2886.428,"--I think it is, Your Honor, but let me just say that that's a claim that he could have brought before the CSRTs, and that is a claim he can still bring before the military commissions."
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2886.428,2886.755,But I have--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2886.755,2887.372,Lawful--
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2887.372,2898.851,"--I have... I have trouble with the argument that... insofar as he says there is a structural invalidity to the military commission, that he brings that before the commission."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2908.842,2911.88,"--Well, and we disagree with those claims."
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2924.888,2925.438,"Well, it's not some--"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2925.438,2926.749,--he could... he could make that argument.
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2926.749,2934.546,--procedural... it's the structural requirement of the composition and the... and the appointing origins of the court.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2934.546,2938.245,"Well, again, I think he could... he could bring that claim."
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.842,2950.275,I thought--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2950.275,2950.725,--principles--
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.725,2969.841,"--I thought we... I thought we established, earlier... somebody told me... that, in the normal criminal suit, even if you claim that the forum is not properly constituted, that claim is not adjudicated immediately, it's adjudicated at the conclusion of the proceeding."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2969.841,2971.518,"--Well, of course that's true."
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.668,2972.085,We--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2972.085,2972.529,--also--
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.529,2979.832,--We don't... we don't intervene on habeas corpus when somebody says that the panel is improperly constituted.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2982.187,2983.781,"--That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2986.052,2986.235,"Well, is--"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2986.235,2986.985,--even when a U.S.--
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2986.985,2988.658,--is that... is that true?
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2999.41,3002.348,"--Well, with respect, Justice Kennedy, this isn't a ""group of people""."
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3013.433,3023.009,I had thought that the historic function of habeas is to... one of its functions... is to test the jurisdiction and the legitimacy of a court.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3023.009,3030.229,"Well, but... habeas corpus generally doesn't give a right to a pre enforcement challenge."
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3033.177,3037.376,To a forum that is prima facie properly constituted.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3050.816,3052.744,"--Well, that's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.548,3058.998,"But, Mr. Clement--"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3058.998,3059.431,--judge made--
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.431,3074.182,"--if you assume that the laws of war apply, and perhaps the treaty applies, isn't the issue whether this is a ""group of people"", on the one hand, or a ""regularly constituted court"", on the other?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3074.182,3079.708,"--Well, I mean, I don't really think there's any serious dispute about which it is."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.479,3085.512,"Well, they argue very strenuously that this is really just a ""group of people""--"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3085.512,3086.773,--Well... and if this Court--
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.773,3090.544,"--because it's not a ""regularly constituted court"" within the meaning of the treaty."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3090.544,3096.514,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I think that even if a court might have had jurisdiction to hear just that issue and--"
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.514,3096.914,Yes.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3096.914,3113.225,"--nothing else before the DTA, Congress has now spoken, and Congress has made it clear that, whatever else is true, these military commission proceedings can proceed, and exclusive review can be done after the fact, after conviction, in the D.C. Circuit."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3113.225,3114.819,Exclusive review of what?
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3122.651,3124.489,"Well, I think I disagree, at least--"
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3124.489,3128.771,They can... they can... they can review their enemy combatant determination.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3145.332,3146.743,"--Oh, I disagree, Justice Souter."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3154.975,3155.208,"So, you're reading--"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3155.208,3155.708,--to the extent--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3155.708,3156.124,--procedures--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3156.124,3156.624,--they're pledgeable.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3156.624,3161.167,--to encompass the very act constituting the court itself?
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3164.855,3175.525,"Sure, if they want to come in and argue that there is a violation of Article 21 of the UCMJ, or Article 36 of the UCMJ, after their conviction, they are perfectly free to do that--"
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3175.525,3176.369,It's hard for me to--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3176.369,3176.785,"--under E(3), but--"
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3176.785,3183.339,"--see that with the language of this, because the language that you're talking about refers to ""such standards""."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3271.035,3273.556,"--Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer both pieces of that."
2005.05-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3298.926,3299.292,Would you--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3299.292,3299.458,And--
2005.05-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3299.458,3299.658,--Would you--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3299.658,3310.044,"--I think the language is capacious enough if the treaty challenge is what you thought was very important, the D.C. Circuit, at the end of the day, could decide whether or not there is a requirement that the treaty challenge be brought."
2005.05-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3310.044,3314.926,"--General Clement, if you can straighten me out on the piece that you read about"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3333.226,3335.747,"That is true, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3365.566,3365.75,But what--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3365.75,3366.316,"So, that--"
2005.05-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3366.316,3382.789,"--But how will the question, whether the laws in the United... and Constitution... of the United States, whether these petitioners have any claim to state under the laws and Constitution of the United States?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3392.797,3405.637,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think that Petitioner will be up there arguing that Eisentrager is no longer good law, not just as a statutory matter, as a constitutional matter, and those arguments will be made."
2005.05-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3428.242,3428.675,Is there--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3428.675,3428.992,But one thing I--
2005.05-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3428.992,3440.744,"--Is there... is there any review in this Court, following the D.C. Circuit, either the original classification or the conviction... is there... does this Court have any part in the scheme?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3440.744,3443.682,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there would be 1254 review."
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3455.367,3458.717,"I still don't see the answer to my question, which had two parts."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3508.446,3526.502,"Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer that question in two parts, which is to say that I think that this case, and most of the cases, don't raise a serious Suspension Clause problem, for the simple reason that I think deferring review or channeling it to the Court of Appeals does not amount to a suspension."
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3526.502,3537.254,"I listed four sets of cases that I don't see how you could possibly shoehorn into E(2) and E(3), even if you are able to shoehorn this one."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3541.369,3542.113,"Well, but--"
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3542.113,3545.579,But I listed four that I don't see how anybody could shoehorn into that.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3545.579,3557.165,"--But, with respect, Justice Breyer, I think that cuts both ways, because I don't think there's any particular interpretation of these provisions on the table before this Court that's going to eliminate those potential Suspension Clause issues."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3557.165,3577.408,"--But the whole point, it seems to me, of the argument, is, Should we not consider the significance of those very questions, because, if we don't, as Justice Breyer said, at the end of the day, as you describe it, we will have to face the serious constitutional question of whether Congress can, in fact, limit jurisdiction without suspending habeas corpus?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3590.016,3597.903,"Well, Justice Souter, first of all, I would think general principles of constitutional avoidance would say deferring the constitutional question is a good thing, not a bad thing."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3598.663,3601.268,We may not have to reach the constitutional question.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3604.306,3604.8,--Right.
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3609.865,3610.509,"No, the argument--"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3610.509,3610.976,--don't apply this--
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3610.976,3616.235,"--the other side... if you want the argument, the other side is, there are several hundred cases already pending."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3636.546,3636.713,--Well--
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3636.713,3641.756,"--the question that this is unconstitutional... if not here, in other places?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3641.756,3649.153,"--And, Justice Breyer, what I would say is that our interpretation basically provides for pending claims exactly the way that Congress did."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3755.333,3755.633,May I ask--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3755.633,3757.177,--retroactivity aspect... I'm sorry.
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3757.177,3759.282,"--May I just ask this, to clarify?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3772.061,3774.399,"I think both, ultimately."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3775.066,3775.91,"Well, it can't be both."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3776.343,3780.787,"--Well, I... I don't see why I can't have alternative arguments here, as for anywhere else, Justice Stevens."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3788.34,3788.64,"Well, that--"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3788.64,3789.367,"--it did, I think that--"
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3789.367,3791.789,"--that's your position, they did not suspend the writ."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3794.827,3800.686,"--Well, I think the terms of the Suspension Clause would be satisfied here because of the exigencies of 9/11."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3807.406,3807.917,Okay.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3807.917,3816.065,"And if you think, in order for there be to a... to be a valid suspension, Congress has to do it consciously, then I think you could see why the arguments are mutually exclusive."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3826.056,3826.406,Isn't there a--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3826.406,3826.75,I mean--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3826.75,3837.236,--Isn't there a pretty good argument that a suspension of the writ of Congress is just about the most stupendously significant act that the Congress of the United States can take?
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3844.807,3846.895,"--Well, a couple of things, Justice Souter."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3861.429,3861.595,If we have to--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3861.595,3862.079,--in Rasul.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3862.079,3880.512,"--get to the issue, in accordance with Justice Breyer's question, whether or not the writ of habeas corpus was suspended, you are leaving us with the position of the United States that the Congress may validly suspend it inadvertently."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3882.19,3886.038,I think at least if you're talking about the extension of the writ to enemy combatants--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3886.038,3886.771,The writ is the--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3886.771,3887.004,--held outside--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3887.004,3887.854,--The writ is the--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3887.854,3887.937,--the territory of the United States--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3887.937,3888.598,"--Now, wait a minute."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3889.764,3890.025,--Okay.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3890.025,3894.557,There are not two writs of habeas corpus for some cases and for other cases.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3924.887,3925.637,"No, Justice Souter."
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3931.607,3931.74,They could surely--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3931.74,3932.156,--to suspend the writ.
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3932.156,3936.955,--set forth a procedure which amounts to a suspension of the writ.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3950.723,3950.923,That is my point.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3952.601,3955.422,Is it also your point when there is no insurrection or invasion?
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3955.422,3959.287,"--Well, then any effort to suspend the writ would be invalid."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3961.309,3967.685,Perhaps that's something that a court ought to inquire into when it gets into the question of congressional intent.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3967.685,3969.029,--I don't think--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3969.029,3969.539,And how specific--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3969.539,3969.839,--I disagree with that.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3969.839,3970.339,--that intent--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3970.339,3971.233,I guess my point would--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3971.233,3972.811,--and how specific that intent must be.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3972.811,3974.238,--I don't think I disagree with that.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3990.322,3990.488,Okay.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3990.738,3991.272,But that's not--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3991.272,3991.438,--Let's--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3991.438,3991.555,--at issue here.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3991.555,3994.626,--Let's assume we do not have a magic words requirement.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4003.618,4003.984,Yes.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4017.242,4017.809,There may be nothing--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4017.809,4018.236,--to the habeas statute.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4018.236,4027.727,"--subtle about the statute, but there is something very silent about the statute as to whether Congress understood that it was... that it was acting under its authority to suspend the writ of habeas corpus."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4054.941,4063.088,"With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think making a retroactivity analysis or holding here is going to spare you the trouble of dealing with the Suspension Clause argument."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4080.478,4080.628,It comes--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4080.628,4081.461,--is a new subsection.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4081.461,4089.475,"--It comes as a wolf under H(2), but the wolf is silent under H(1), and the wolf used to speak under H(1), and it had its teeth taken out."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4089.692,4092.907,"With respect, Justice Souter, H(1) never spoke to the question."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4099.643,4099.81,And that's--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4099.81,4100.16,--you that.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4100.16,4100.921,--gone.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4100.921,4101.737,That's gone.
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4105.586,4106.185,The very fact--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4106.185,4106.336,Senator--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4106.336,4112.389,--that Congress chose to remove the clarity of the prior provision is of no significance?
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4112.389,4114.483,"--It's not of dispositive significance, Justice Souter."
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4114.483,4116.504,I don't think Congress chose to do that.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4121.714,4124.142,"That's a very fair point, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4144.319,4144.828,What--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4144.828,4145.345,This Court did not--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4145.345,4160.098,"--Whatever may be the standard of due care for courts in reviewing acts of Congress with respect to attorneys fees, it doesn't reach the level that, it seems to me, is incumbent on us when we're talking about suspending the writ of habeas corpus."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4160.098,4166.151,"--I don't disagree with that, Justice Souter, but there's no special habeas retroactivity law."
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4170.7,4170.983,Can--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4170.983,4171.694,--22--
2005.05-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4171.694,4172.127,--Yes.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4172.127,4174.814,--this whole thing is a 2241(e) new section.
2005.05-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4176.642,4181.102,May I ask you another question about the clarity with which Congress spoke?
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4227.05,4232.259,"I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that, you're right, this isn't like ex parte McArdle."
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4251.658,4251.942,Mr.--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4251.942,4253.431,That's happened any number of times.
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4277.623,4280.394,"--Mr. Clement, I, for one, have lost track of your time."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4285.688,4289.476,"And if I could talk to various aspects of that, I'm happy--"
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4289.476,4289.72,Can I put the--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4289.72,4290.136,--to do so.
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4290.136,4294.752,"--that issue in... don't... ignore my question, which is the same as Justice Kennedy's, if it doesn't help."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4341.943,4343.22,Let me try to hit a couple--
2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4346.335,4349.274,"I'll be interested in your answer, if you can get it out."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4349.491,4353.306,Let me try to hit a couple of highlights.
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4706.973,4708.217,And there was a footnote dicta.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4708.217,4710.405,"--Well, I don't think it was dicta, Justice Stevens."
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4798.278,4809.524,"Does it... does it... does it define the contours, along with other relevant international sources, of the meaning of the statutory words ""laws of war""."
2005.05-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4824.393,4831.279,"And, in particular, why isn't he part of Common Article 3 under the Geneva Convention, as Judge Williams found?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4832.873,4838.927,"--Well, Judge Williams found that, you know, Common Article 3 was applicable here."
2005.05-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4912.005,4920.752,"Is it the President, and not Congress, defining the content of the law, the criminal law, under which a person will be tried?"
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4923.768,4928.567,"I sure hope not, Justice Breyer, because that's been the tradition for over 200 years."
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4938.058,4938.636,But I don't--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4938.636,4938.852,So--
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4938.852,4944.845,"--think, Mr. Clement, the 200 years have approved of his adding additional crimes under the law of war."
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4952.492,4954.421,"--I think that may be true, Justice Stevens--"
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4954.421,4954.615,Yes.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4954.615,4955.231,--certainly as to the Article--
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4955.231,4955.448,And one--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4955.448,4956.025,--21 point.
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4956.025,4957.619,--of the issues is whether he's done that here--
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4957.619,4957.986,But--
2005.05-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4957.986,4958.547,--I think.
2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4958.547,4961.901,--But there's no innovation in trying conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.

2005.05-184,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,4964.423,4968.288,"Well, I hope so, because there's really no question that conspiracy has been charged."

2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5022.85,5028.259,I thought... I thought... I thought you said all prisoners of war were uniquely vulnerable... I thought that was the point you were making--

2005.05-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5029.037,5029.62,--and had... needed--
