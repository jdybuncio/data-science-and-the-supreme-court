1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,64.173,"Mr. Butler, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,64.173,66.542,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.817,108.102,You say that's the result of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision?
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,108.102,109.019,--That is correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.019,110.887,And what's the matter with that result?
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,110.887,129.033,"In this particular case, the problem with that result is that, as Appellee concedes in their brief, it removes an appeal from the adversarial testing process once counsel reaches the conclusion that there is no merit to the appeal."
1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.693,162.488,"Well, of course, indigent defendants who will get appeals as a matter of right as in Wisconsin are entitled to the benefit of counsel, but we have cases that say they're not going to get everything that the well-heeled criminal defendant is going to get."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,181.716,186.87,We are not contending that the indigent defendant is entitled to everything.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,263.803,265.388,"May I interrupt, Mr. Butler, right there?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,286.301,289.337,--The one thing that Anders did... I do not.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,290.687,296.341,You think that is the same advocacy that the rich person that the Chief Justice mentioned would get?
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,296.341,297.693,--Right.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.593,302.978,It is the same advocacy that the rich client would get?
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,307.446,307.763,--No.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,314.869,320.238,"What we've got is a case where the paying client, if he's got a conscience lawyer, would say to him, you're going to waste your money."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,326.759,327.376,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,327.376,331.661,What you're saying is that the poor defendant is entitled to have the state waste the same amount of money.
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,331.661,333.211,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,333.211,333.946,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,333.946,342.136,"In effect, the poor defendant... for example, in Anders, Anders tried to resolve a difficult ethical dilemma that counsel faces."
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.934,368.101,But he's not under Anders.
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,369.719,372.155,"--Under Anders, he is entitled to that."
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.155,373.888,"No, he's not entitled to the vigorous advocacy."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,380.059,385.046,That's should the Court reach the conclusion that the case is wholly frivolous.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,386.163,389.498,"But he doesn't go in and make a vigorous argument, don't let me withdraw."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,401.072,401.322,--Right.
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.049,455.975,"But if he points out those arguable basis for the appeal, and then in the last line says I resign, please let me out, and the Court lets him out, there's nothing wrong with that, is there?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,455.975,457.192,No.
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,457.192,458.094,That's what Anders says.
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,458.094,458.894,That is what Anders says.
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,458.894,463.563,And he doesn't need to give any reason for asking to resign or to get out?
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,463.563,464.665,I don't think he should.
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.681,471.902,"So, it's just to be inferred that my mother-in-law is sick or what?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,476.055,476.788,"--No, no."
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.622,481.024,--It's really inferred that he thinks it's frivolous.
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,481.024,481.542,--Right.
1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,497.302,508.694,"But that's the kiss of death in any real live court, is to say I'm going to make the following points and I intend to make them very vigorously, but I want to tell you beforehand that I think it's all a pile of junk."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,512.396,515.013,"In Anders, that essentially is correct."
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.607,531.975,And we've said that that doesn't violate the 6th Amendment.
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,531.975,532.892,--That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.892,539.713,"So, why does it violate the 6th Amendment for the lawyer to tell the Court why he thinks it's frivolous?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,539.713,551.437,"At that point, by telling the Court why the case is frivolous, the lawyer is doing more than just acknowledging that, in his opinion, the case is weak, but the Court must make the determination."
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.296,575.719,"Well, a lawyer has an ethical obligation under some circumstances to bring to the Court's attention authorities on the other side, doesn't he?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,575.719,576.219,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,576.219,576.452,Or she?
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,576.452,580.171,And that's why I believe that Anders resolved that ethical dilemma.
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.197,601.684,"And so he can't be sanctioned then, I suppose."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,601.684,602.452,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.452,608.44,"Because most lawyers have, at least under the current rules, have an obligation not to file frivolous papers."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,608.44,609.14,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.556,616.527,"Because they can be... certainly, in the trial court, Rule 11 would catch them, isn't that right?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,616.527,616.944,--That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.944,628.235,"So, I don't know that you can say that even a well-paid... even a paying client isn't entitled to a lawyer who will file frivolous cases."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,630.854,631.37,No.
1987.87-5002,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.108,637.875,It has been done.
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,671.464,672.197,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.446,727.148,"Yes, but that's not what brings you here."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,732.468,733.918,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.67,737.454,Right.
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,783.947,790.887,"In answer to your question, Justice Scalia, first of all, in Wisconsin, the Attorney General's office is not supposed to file a response brief in an Anders situation."
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,814.882,817.918,"Yes, but I don't see how that hurts your client."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,849.287,859.143,"Actually, it does not because by providing the Court with those reasons, assuming that you've made an accurate determination, what you have done in that situation is told the Court why the case lacks merit."
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.332,874.403,"Yes, but if he is wrong, he won't be able to spell out satisfactory reasons and he'll change his mind."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,879.038,886.96,"But the answer to that, Justice Stevens, is that in that situation, the Court can order the opposing side to brief the case for the other side."
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.564,913.61,"It seems to me in that case, it would be better for the lawyer to find out himself that he was initially wrong in his judgment of frivolity or frivolousness, whatever the right word is, and to correct it himself and say, no, there is some merit to it, rather than filing an Anders brief without an explanation and then having the state say, well, he acknowledges frivolous, so that's it."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,913.61,917.312,"Justice Stevens, I think a lawyer does that when he makes the analysis of the case."
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.312,918.062,"Well, you hope he does."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,918.062,920.514,The problem is not with making the analysis for the case.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.997,925.132,"Well, if he does it, how often does he do it wrong?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,928.351,931.184,"--Your Honor, I've only filed two Anders briefs in my life."
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.838,939.79,"In those cases, do you think it would have really made any difference if you'd included the statement of reasons?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,939.79,950.264,"In one of the cases, in fact, I did include a statement of the reasons at my client's direction, and I do think it made a difference because his case came subsequent to this one."
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,964.524,969.928,"Well, except the Constitution doesn't really contemplate an awful lot of frivolous appeals."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,973.63,974.83,No.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.028,1054.248,"Yes, but you're arguing... you say he's entitled to the undivided loyalty of the lawyer."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1067.425,1068.642,--There's nothing inconsistent with that.
1987.87-5002,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.642,1074.661,"And then he goes on and he says, moreover, since it's frivolous, I have an ethical duty not to prosecute it and to advise the Court of it."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1077.047,1085.903,"Because the client at that point says, I have a right to an appeal and I want the appeal, and at that point, the lawyer's duty is to protect that appeal."
1987.87-5002,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.557,1110.002,"Well, Wisconsin can well look at it a different way, that the reason he's setting forth the causes for frivolousness are not to harm his client, but, rather, to justify to the Court his withdrawal from the case."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1149.377,1152.246,"I understand your concern, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1184.598,1219.538,"Well, Mr. Butler, I think there is a good deal of difference between a trial situation where the burden of proof is always on the Government and any competent attorney knows that he represents the defendant by simply putting the Government to its proof, just by cross examining, and on the other hand, on appeal, you get into situations, which I daresay you've confronted some yourself having filed two Anders, where you have to... you know, the burden of proof is no longer on the Government, the burden of proof is on the Appellant, and there just isn't much... there's virtually nothing to complain about."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1225.425,1230.043,"Justice Rehnquist, I think your question points to the very reason why this case is here."
1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.431,1280.66,"Yes, but you would agree, I take it, that there are some appeals, I don't know how large a class it is, that even the best lawyer in the world has virtually no chance of getting... of succeeding on; whereas, it's not nearly as easy to evaluate that in the trial situation."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1291.5,1294.652,"I understand your concern, Justice Rehnquist."
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1312.614,1346.185,"Well, Mr. Butler, suppose the state as a matter of course set these appeals for a limited oral argument in each instance, and the lawyer comes in representing the defendant and has indicated to the Court that the lawyer wants to withdraw, and the reason is the lawyer thinks that it's frivolous, do you think the Court can properly ask the lawyer to justify that orally and say, tell me why you think we should let you withdraw?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1346.801,1349.703,Not if the lawyer is going to remain an advocate on behalf of the client.
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1349.703,1357.893,You don't think the Court can properly even ask the lawyer at oral argument to explain?
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1357.893,1359.845,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1367.082,1372.985,"Then you think that the lawyer has no duty to the Court, even when the Court asks the lawyer's help?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1372.985,1373.485,No.
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1397.184,1403.504,"Well, don't you recognize that every lawyer has two loyalties, in effect; one to the client and one to the Court?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1405.104,1407.623,"Yes, but it's the duty--"
1987.87-5002,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1407.623,1417.847,"Yes, that's right, and it seems to me that the Court can ask the lawyer to tell the Court why the lawyer is taking a certain position."
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1422.966,1463.726,"--I think in that situation, it can only do so if it redefines the role of either the appeal or counsel in that setting because as long as this Court has taken the position that a client is entitled to the adversarial process in an appeal, and as long as this Court has taken the position that the client is entitled to an advocate, to then say, but in this narrow realm of cases, we're going to give these clients less than that is giving that class of clients less than the advocacy and the appellate representation than other clients are receiving."
1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.133,1533.203,"Do you think Justice Abrahamson, who dissented below, was very happy with the Anders situation?"
1987.87-5002,0,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1533.203,1535.155,I'm not sure she was.
1987.87-5002,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1563.99,1565.192,"Thank you, Mr. Butler."
1987.87-5002,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1567.958,1571.862,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-5002,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.608,1659.302,Does the state's procedure here satisfy the Anders requirement that the attorney point to anything in the record that arguably supports his client?
1987.87-5002,1,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1659.302,1659.82,"--Yes, sir."
1987.87-5002,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.64,1669.009,"And then he says, but this is frivolous?"
1987.87-5002,2,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,1669.009,1670.192,Yes.
1987.87-5002,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.192,1677.615,"Because these things are... these arguments are so baseless, they're frivolous, is that it?"
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1677.615,1677.981,Yes.
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.589,1698.362,"Well, Justice Harlan in Anders has said that you can't really point... if you can point to anything that's arguable, it just isn't frivolous."
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1698.362,1724.66,"That's a difficult part of implementing the Anders decision, and I think what maybe what's required is that the defense attorney review the case and he finds it's frivolous, and then he or she has to look at it and those things... when you review a record that you find is frivolous, there are certainly going to be things that draw your attention, you check out, because it just doesn't seem... seems out of the ordinary."
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.183,1752.895,"Anders didn't say on its face that you weren't entitled not only to satisfy what the Court said the attorney had to say, but it didn't say that... it didn't hold that the... that it was impermissible for the lawyer to explain why he thought it was frivolous."
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1752.895,1753.728,--Right.
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1764.202,1774.641,But I suppose the case that's arguably more against this Wisconsin procedure is Ellis.
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1774.641,1776.76,"Well, as I recall--"
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.76,1779.462,"That's a short precarium, but it doesn't say very much."
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1779.462,1785.615,"--And that's the problem, I think, that it doesn't say very much because in reading the case, we don't know what exactly it was the attorneys did."
1987.87-5002,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.777,1814.348,"Is it not true that in Ellis, both sides agreed the appeal was not frivolous?"
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1818.466,1825.22,"But I think that... the attorneys who had reviewed it had originally reached a conclusion, I think, based on the argument that--"
1987.87-5002,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1825.22,1829.791,The Solicitor General agreed when the case was before us that it was not a frivolous case.
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1829.791,1841.682,"--But I think a case would be one where I think someone could look at it and say, you're probably going to lose, but it's not frivolous because you have a good argument, but you may still lose it."
1987.87-5002,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.111,1869.896,"Well, surely you can't withdraw under Anders just because you think the odds are against you on that."
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1869.896,1871.062,That's precisely right.
1987.87-5002,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.062,1873.681,Then you wouldn't have any criminal appeals if that was the case.
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1873.681,1877.799,"That's precisely right, and that's where I think the attorney acts as an advocate because he doesn't view it that way."
1987.87-5002,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1977.73,1986.753,"But for what it's worth, it does relieve you as representative of the state of a duty to brief the case."
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,1986.753,1993.358,"I think that's right, but I think that's part of the whole process, because if the state is briefing the case, what you have is an appeal."
1987.87-5002,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2013.586,2015.105,Why should they be relieved?
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2015.105,2019.807,So that the... the defense lawyer?
1987.87-5002,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.496,2032.365,Is it true that the Government does not file briefs in these cases?
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2032.365,2033.298,Not in Wisconsin.
1987.87-5002,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2052.611,2053.694,"So, there's no appeal?"
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2053.694,2054.728,That's right.
1987.87-5002,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2054.728,2061.548,Why should the Court have to determine whether there is or is not merit after an Anders brief is filed?
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2062.898,2074.023,"Well, this Court said in Anders that the Court has the responsibility to make the independent determination whether the appeal is frivolous, and--"
1987.87-5002,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2074.023,2076.557,"I still ask, why isn't it your job, though?"
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2080.359,2092.834,"--Yes, there is some benefit, but, again, I think the purpose of this is to avoid an appeal because the issue is determined as frivolous, and if you have the state responding, that is an appeal."
1987.87-5002,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.84,2135.93,"May I ask, before this rule... how long has the rule been in its present form?"
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2135.93,2137.396,I think since 1978.
1987.87-5002,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.396,2145.619,"Do you happen to know whether before 1978, when an Anders brief was filed without an explanation of why it was frivolous, did the state then respond?"
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2145.619,2147.486,"No, it did not."
1987.87-5002,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.486,2148.919,"So, that hasn't changed."
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2162.626,2167.661,"I'm not sure if even before this rule, if the briefs... if the no merit reports were even filed with the Attorney General's office."
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.68,2181.421,Do you know where we could find or I could find an example of a brief that satisfies the Wisconsin rule?
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2192.978,2193.361,Right.
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.828,2198.382,And that's the way this original proceeding got started.
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2198.382,2198.849,--Right.
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.588,2216.011,"You say that it's possible to file a letter that satisfies both Anders and the Wisconsin rule, I take it?"
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2218.963,2220.596,"Well, what I meant was I--"
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.596,2230.77,"All you have to do is add to an Anders brief when you say, I think that the case is frivolous, I want to withdraw, and here's why I think it's frivolous."
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2230.77,2231.786,--That's right.
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.507,2240.376,But you think it's possible to write a letter that satisfies both Anders and the Wisconsin rule?
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2240.376,2253.017,"Well, I think that if you satisfy the Wisconsin rule, you will... you have satisfied Anders because the Wisconsin rule requires the same thing as Anders, and, in addition, specifically requires the attorney explain."
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.017,2263.575,"But there is nothing in this case and there's nothing... not in this record, is there, an example of the letter--"
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2263.575,2267.943,"No, it's not a situation where the evidence was introduced that would have precluded."
1987.87-5002,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.943,2274.613,"--So, we really are sort of dealing in an abstraction."
1987.87-5002,3,41579,stephen_w_kleinmaier,,2274.613,2276.147,Yes.
1987.87-5002,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2333.636,2336.252,"Thank you, Mr. Kleinmaier."
1987.87-5002,4,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,2338.354,2340.622,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-5002,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.959,2405.814,"Well, certainly the Supreme Court of Wisconsin didn't think it was contrary to the Wisconsin Constitution or they wouldn't have said it was all right."
1987.87-5002,4,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,2405.814,2419.138,"That's correct, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court in making that ruling basically admitted that it was going beyond the requirements of Anders and that it was asking an attorney to do something more than remain as an advocate."
1987.87-5002,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.138,2421.138,"Well, that is undoubtedly a federal constitutional question."
1987.87-5002,4,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,2428.744,2434.731,"No, I'm not arguing that it's strictly a violation of the Wisconsin Constitution, from that standpoint."
1987.87-5002,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.977,2457.846,"Mr. Butler, just to help me out on one thing."
1987.87-5002,4,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,2466.785,2469.202,The issues that have been identified are in the record.
1987.87-5002,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.928,2486.88,But can you tell me where in the record those issues are identified?
1987.87-5002,4,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,2486.88,2487.846,Those are in the joint appendix.
1987.87-5002,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.846,2501.404,Are you the one who filed the Anders letter?
1987.87-5002,4,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,2501.404,2502.137,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.137,2509.891,And said that you couldn't really... and you left out the explanation of frivolity?
1987.87-5002,4,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,2509.891,2510.307,That's correct.
1987.87-5002,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.028,2515.028,Thank you very much.
1987.87-5002,4,34096,louis_bennett_butler_jr,,2515.028,2518.313,"If there are no further questions, thank you very much."
1987.87-5002,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.313,2519.468,"Thank you, Mr. Butler."
