1983.82-1071,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.673,Mr. Popofsky.
1983.82-1071,0,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,62.673,65.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1071,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.215,388.118,"Mr. Popofsky, do we find this heart of the statute in any one section or subsection?"
1983.82-1071,0,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,388.118,405.08,"We do not find it in any one section of the 85 pages of legislation, but I believe you will find it mostly in section 5 where the sales to classes of customers are mandated, and that is the key, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-1071,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.369,498.773,"Mr. Popofsky, I have the same question really I guess that Justice Rehnquist has already asked."
1983.82-1071,0,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,507.362,507.846,That is correct.
1983.82-1071,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,507.846,513.099,What is it in section 5 that mandates the allocation that you describe?
1983.82-1071,0,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,513.099,522.371,"If you look further into section 5 in the (b) sections, Your Honor, you will find the terms of contracts that are mandated."
1983.82-1071,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,524.287,525.453,What page are you working from?
1983.82-1071,0,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,525.453,532.274,"--I am working in the statute, Your Honor, (b)(38)(5)(g)(1)."
1983.82-1071,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.274,536.095,(5)(g)(1) is on page 3 of the petition for certiorari.
1983.82-1071,0,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,536.095,539.047,I was also referring to the appendix to the petition.
1983.82-1071,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,612.726,615.409,"But, Mr. Popofsky, (5)(a) does not say that."
1983.82-1071,0,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,622.582,624.198,"I agree, Your Honor."
1983.82-1071,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.117,708.771,Would you go back a minute and spell out a little more what you mean by preference attaches only at the time the contract is offered?
1983.82-1071,0,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,708.771,709.404,Yes.
1983.82-1071,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,817.773,834.901,Mr. Ganzfried.
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,834.901,837.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1071,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.234,993.769,May I interrupt right there with just one question?
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,993.769,994.303,Surely.
1983.82-1071,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.303,1006.827,Under your view of the issue in the case if your side wins will the DSI customers get the same or a greater amount of power than they would have gotten under the prior law?
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1006.827,1011.831,They would be entitled to the same amount of power?
1983.82-1071,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1011.831,1016.135,Would they not get a little more because they have an additional protection?
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1016.135,1019.853,"Well, they have an additional protection as to the first quartile."
1983.82-1071,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.036,1075.34,"So your answer is that Congress thought it would be higher, but you are not sure they were right."
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1075.34,1077.49,Congress thought it would be higher.
1983.82-1071,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.725,1084.946,Is it correct that if we take your opponent's interpretation of the law they would get the same amount of power?
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1084.946,1122.119,"--Well, not necessarily because what would happen under the Respondents' view of the case, as I understand it, is that the total entitlement to power would be... I might add under what I understand is the Ninth Circuit's view of the case... the total entitlement to power for the DSI's is not the full contract load, not what is specified in the '75 contracts as the amount of power, but rather three-quarters of that because as the Ninth Circuit believed it was only three-quarters of that that had been allocated."
1983.82-1071,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.119,1125.837,It is a right to three-quarters and a possibility of more.
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1125.837,1128.856,"Well, but that is not the way the '75 contracts work."
1983.82-1071,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.054,1526.83,"Mr. Ganzfried, I take it your position is that this is the only way the statute could be construed, or is the statute reasonably construable in another way?"
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1526.83,1531.584,"--Well, our first point is that this is the only way the statute could be construed."
1983.82-1071,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.322,1544.726,"So that if Bonneville had taken the course as suggested by your opposition, would it have violated the statute?"
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1544.726,1559.235,"--If it had offered less than the amount of power entitlement of the 1975 contract it probably would have been a violation of the statute, and that is one of the reasons why it--"
1983.82-1071,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.235,1560.087,You have to say it would have.
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1560.087,1562.872,"--It would have, but we did not--"
1983.82-1071,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.872,1572.395,Your position just is not that the statute is construable one way or another and that Bonneville chose one of the reasonable courses and that we should defer.
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1574.347,1582.667,"--Our first argument is that there was only one way it could be done, and it was done that way and it was the way that Congress was told it would be done."
1983.82-1071,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.426,1611.5,What was the Ninth Circuit's answer to... Was the Ninth Circuit of the view that the statute had to be read the other way?
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1611.5,1616.888,The Ninth Circuit was of the view presumably that it had to be read another way.
1983.82-1071,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.888,1619.09,It just preferred to read it another way.
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1619.09,1628.379,"Well, it preferred to read it the other way even though as it said that Bonneville's interpretation was supported by the legislative history."
1983.82-1071,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.265,1642.788,"They seem to think the statute was readable either way, but that it just preferred another reading."
1983.82-1071,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1642.788,1644.907,What it did was it focused on the preference clause.
1983.82-1071,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1755.528,1757.163,Very well.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,1763.984,1768.286,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.545,1909.329,Mr. Waldron.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,1909.329,1909.912,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.912,1918.067,"You do not argue that section 10 means that the Act that we are construing here did not change the Bonneville Act, do you?"
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,1918.067,1926.84,"Justice Rehnquist, Bonneville sells power under two statutes, the Bonneville Project Act and the Flood Control Act."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.498,1952.741,"But are you arguing that the Act that we are here considering did not really make any changes in the Bonneville Act, that it presumably succeeded?"
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,1952.741,1957.561,"Well, it did not make changes in the Bonneville Act."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.068,2014.581,"To take 5(d)(1)(B), which your opponents rely on, which says the administrator shall offer in accordance with subsection (g) an initial long-term contract that provides an amount of power equivalent to that which such customers are entitled."
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2015.731,2016.331,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2016.331,2023.937,What is your interpretation of the sort of contract that the administrator was required to offer under that section?
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2023.937,2039.446,"Congress would be required to offer a contract that provided the same rights to power that they had under... excuse me, Bonneville would be required to offer a contract that gave them the same rights to power that they had under their 1975 contract."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.446,2042.148,But 5(d)(1)(B) talks about an amount of power.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2042.148,2048.385,It talks about an amount of power equivalent to that to which they were entitled.
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.86,2139.062,"You are talking about the present Act, now, right?"
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2139.062,2139.562,Yes.
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.476,2238.492,Mr. Waldron.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2238.492,2239.109,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2239.109,2266.745,"Supposing under the Bonneville Act which is superseded by the present Act a DSI had a 20-year contract for a certain amount of power as such a contract would have been issued under the Bonneville Act, now could a preference customer come in during the pendency of that 20-year contract and say, look, we have got a lot of new people that want electricity; we want you to cut in on the DSI's contract?"
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2266.745,2278.803,"No, we would not have done that because the DSI's contracts provided for certain interruption rights to cover that process in case we grew and Bonneville did not have the resources."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2282.338,2284.139,"No, I am interested in the past."
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2284.139,2284.672,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.672,2295.514,So you really agree with your opponents then that preference could not be used to cut into the rights of an existing DSI contract under the Bonneville Act?
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2295.514,2304.703,That is correct if there was an amount of power available when the administrator entered into that contract that we reasonably could not foresee.
1983.82-1071,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.226,2322.463,Then are you contending that you have greater rights to interrupt your existing DSI contracts than you had under the prior law?
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2322.463,2322.98,"No, sir."
1983.82-1071,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.98,2325.265,I do not understand the two answers.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2332.938,2334.654,Perhaps I was not clear.
1983.82-1071,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.004,2362.571,You say that he has made an illegal contract?
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2362.571,2363.289,Yes.
1983.82-1071,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.839,2366.325,So you are not cutting into anything.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2370.627,2371.31,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1071,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.475,2396.11,May I ask another question?
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2404.783,2405.333,No.
1983.82-1071,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.046,2431.867,Tell me how do you know whether a particular day's production is in the top or the bottom quartile.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2431.867,2435.802,One-fourth of their loads is assigned to be in the top quartile.
1983.82-1071,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.802,2439.504,"Is that one-fourth every day or the first three months of the year, or how does it work?"
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2439.504,2440.054,Every day.
1983.82-1071,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2440.054,2440.654,Every day.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2440.654,2441.37,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2510.85,2518.789,"Of course, Bonneville says it is Congress that is done what they say they are just carrying out the instructions."
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2518.789,2540.952,"Justice Rehnquist, I think the legislative history we have cited at page 29 indicates 20 people in Congress, every person that sponsored the bill from the northwest, every single one of them said one thing, we have completely protected the previous priority of my clients."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.966,2613.334,Didn't they have long-term contracts under the Bonneville Project Act?
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2613.334,2614.101,--They were expired.
1983.82-1071,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.322,2687.161,What about the provision of the statute... I do not have it in mind... that says the power shall be deemed to be firm power for the purpose of their contract?
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2687.161,2699.921,That was as they described it a legal fiction that said that there could not be a law suit initially if Bonneville had not been able to buy enough resources to serve them.
1983.82-1071,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.575,2789.562,"Well, then your suggestion is that he did not follow his own testimony."
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2790.229,2791.847,He may have.
1983.82-1071,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.085,2802.203,Anyway his successor then did not act in--
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,2802.203,2811.408,"--No, his successor adopted a different view, and as we described in our brief also declared that there was some negotiation of contracts."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3148.947,3158.903,"--Mr. Waldron, do you think the Ninth Circuit's opinion then was quite a sensible disposition of the various issues of the case including the treatment of the question in footnote 4 in a footnote?"
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,3162.255,3163.624,Yes.
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3201.48,3206.117,And that the material treated in the footnote 4 should not have been in the text at all.
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,3207.986,3225.947,"I am not obviously going to comment on how they write an opinion, but, yes, it should have been in a footnote because the opinion says that the priority is clear and that, therefore, we do not have to go beyond the priority to the equivalent amount of power."
1983.82-1071,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3255.133,3261.37,The material in footnote 4 you say was not raised until petition for rehearing?
1983.82-1071,2,33418,james_t_waldron,,3261.37,3286.753,"Was not emphasized just as, I might add, if we are looking at consistency of administrative construction, for example, the surplus argument, the argument that we only have a right to the surplus and that 5(a) is basically written out of the Act as they would like, that was mentioned for the first time in the petition for rehearing and really briefed for the first time before this Court."
1983.82-1071,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3294.841,3297.726,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Popofsky."
1983.82-1071,3,36453,m_laurence_popofsky,,3303.614,3312.553,Let me start with the observation that the statute nowhere uses the concept of firm power and nowhere uses the concept nonfirm power.
1983.82-1071,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3485.031,3485.781,"Thank you, gentlemen."
