2005.05-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.298,We'll hear argument next in Mohawk Industries v. Williams.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,5.189,7.22,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,161.989,162.755,If we were--
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.755,167.427,"Before you get to your second point, why is that first point before us?"
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,205.154,207.842,"Justice Scalia, the... the answer... a couple answers."
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.25,216.718,As it is in nine other circuits.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,216.718,218.063,As it is in nine other circuits.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.063,219.251,And all circuits against you.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,219.251,221.002,To be sure.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.002,224.925,And we would have been unlikely to accept cert on... on point one alone I think.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,224.925,225.315,Right.
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.441,251.962,"I think it's... it's a little more difficult in your case because you're pursuing an interlocutory appeal, which you were allowed to do only because you've got double certification and you got certification on the questions that the district court addressed."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,257.978,267.386,--The... the question presented in this case... and it's the same question that was presented below... is whether the defendant corporation and its agents under these circumstances can constitute an enterprise.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.386,276.67,In light of the settled rule that a defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,276.67,277.138,To be sure.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.56,284.952,"If you hadn't included that last part, in light of, but it seems to me you're focusing on the... on the particular claim that you're making."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,284.952,294.156,"--But, Justice Scalia, the in light of certainly raises the secondary issue, but it's still... I mean, the rule is whether it's fairly subsumed within the question."
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.675,310.442,"It is logically prior, and I hate to go through all the trouble of figuring out this case if, indeed, corporations are ineligible anyway."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,315.803,322.257,"But the situation that's presented here is identical to the situation that existed in McNally v. United States, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.122,347.747,And they weren't--
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,347.747,349.2,--and it was regarded as fairly subsumed just as--
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.2,349.294,--they weren't--
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,349.294,350.701,"--I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.701,355.373,--they weren't... your problem is you don't have a final judgment.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,390.896,399.086,"I... I don't have any specific authority to the contrary, although the other side didn't argue 1292(b) as in some sense a limitation here."
2005.05-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,413.026,413.901,Suppose we get through that.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,442.439,442.845,--Right.
2005.05-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,442.845,445.83,--what do we do about that particular concession?
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,445.83,453.253,"The... the clause that introduces that is under current law, and that's absolutely true in the Eleventh Circuit."
2005.05-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,526.504,526.941,"Well, unless somebody raises it."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,532.209,535.678,"But all of those courts are going to say the same thing, which is that this issue has been resolved."
2005.05-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.916,560.966,"Well, what... what sense would it make on the merits to get your interpretation on the merits, which would mean, I guess, that five individuals could be an enterprise because that's a group of individuals."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,560.966,561.857,"Yes, that's true."
2005.05-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,561.857,563.263,Five labor unions couldn't.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,576.702,586.002,Because all of those various combinations can still be attacked under the theory of RICO by just simply structuring your... your enterprise in the proper way.
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.803,612.303,If... if--
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,612.303,613.491,And the answer--
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,613.491,617.71,--if Mohawk were a partnership instead of a corporation--
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,617.71,618.116,--Yes.
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,618.116,620.444,--the partnership is an association of individuals.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,620.444,627.758,"Well, a partnership is identified specifically under the statute as a... as a... as an enterprise... as eligible for an enterprise."
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,627.758,633.134,"So if the answer is yes, if Mohawk had been a partnership, you would not have this particular objection."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,633.134,635.15,That's correct.
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,637.026,637.917,So it's only the corporate form.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,637.917,639.323,"--Well, no."
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,644.636,645.682,That's--
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,645.682,652.027,"--does... can you have an associational enterprise that extends beyond individuals, that gets... that goes beyond the gangs and their family."
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.027,657.168,"--Well, that's why I'm asking you about the partnership because it is an association of individuals."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,673.53,681.938,"Yes, let me be clear on this, that if... if you just bring an action against the partnership qua partnership you could clearly do that because that's defined as a... as a legal entity--"
2005.05-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,681.938,682.016,No.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,682.673,692.487,"--for purposes... if you're trying to take the partnership and tag it to another group of rag tag individuals, that would not be an enterprise in fact because that's not an... an association of individuals."
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.43,725.198,"If this provision is exclusive, as you claim it is... it's intended to be an exclusive definition, why... why would they include union, just union and individuals?"
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,728.527,728.714,Because--
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.714,732.277,--that is not equally magic about a partnership or a corporation?
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,732.277,732.434,--No.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.202,747.811,"Oh, I see."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,747.811,748.702,--that it's not a legal entity.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.64,752.922,This refers to a union that is not... is not an association.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,752.922,753.766,Right.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.501,755.314,Or any legal entity.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,755.314,755.751,Right.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.751,756.423,A union that is not--
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,756.423,758.017,It's just an additional item in the list.
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.017,758.533,--not a legal entity.
2005.05-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,759.158,764.377,But why would they use includes in that provision and means in other provisions?
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,764.377,787.383,"Because I think they viewed those as absolutely synonymous, Justice Alito, and... and the reason I think that is because we know that in some instances they use including but not limited to, which reflects that Congress recognized that includes in some contexts is an exhaustive listing, and I think they thought in some contexts, meaning 1961(4), that it was an exhaustive listing."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,882.732,901.563,And don't they do that by... don't the allegations do that here by claiming that the corporation was manufacturing or providing false Social Security cards and was giving aid to the immigrants if the... the law got too close to them?
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,918.943,939.587,"Justice Souter, that is the only allegation that comes remotely close to suggesting anything along those lines, but I... my submission to you is that it doesn't get you there because what it says is that the recruiters are sometimes assisted... it does say the recruiters... by Mohawk employees who carry Social Security cards which they use for prospective or existing employees' needs to assume a new identity."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,955.169,957.794,"Well, maybe I misunderstood the thrust of the allegation."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,964.061,966.781,"Well, I don't doubt that there's a claim that... that there's illegality."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,969.625,974.329,"Doesn't... doesn't that get them at least to... through the motion to dismiss, and doesn't it at least get them to summary judgment?"
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,974.329,982.487,"I don't think so because even in Reves, the... Ernst & Young had been found to have engaged in illegality, that there was... that there was securities fraud involved there."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,996.802,1004.256,But in... in Reves... and if... and... and you... you may well correct me on this because I'm... I'm... my memory is not precise.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1030.214,1035.731,"I don't think so, Justice Souter, because... because the... it's a question I think of abstraction."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1060.204,1071.831,"Well, there is... there is a common element of illegality, but the distinction is that in Reves, you're supposed to be providing these services, making out statements, et cetera, and you put the wrong numbers in them."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1071.831,1073.284,Intentionally.
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1073.284,1082.411,"Whereas in... in this case, an employer does not normally go about providing phony ID's or any ID's for the people it hires."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1089.475,1090.085,Right.
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1118.153,1123.045,"In... in... yes, but you're doing it in connection with a... a joint recruitment activity."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1160.489,1177.368,"But that still doesn't seem to me, Justice Souter, to satisfy the Reves standard, which is not just that there has to be something more than conducting your own affairs immediately, although that's important, and I don't think that... I don't think you can show that... either that we went beyond conducting our affairs or that the recruiters went beyond conducting their affairs."
2005.05-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1187.463,1189.135,So... so that if you charged--
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1189.135,1189.338,And that's the part that's missing.
2005.05-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1189.729,1197.37,"--So that if you charged the workers, you know, $10 for their fake ID cards, you think that would be a different case."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1197.37,1199.151,"No, I don't think either of those--"
2005.05-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1199.151,1204.621,"Because there, that's... there, you... you... there's a separate enterprise basically selling ID cards, and that's not part of Mohawk's business."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1215.421,1220.875,"--Well, see, under those circumstances, I wouldn't have any problem calling Mohawk the enterprise."
2005.05-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.909,1243.927,"Mr. Phillips, I... I tend to agree with that, but I... I just hate to get the lower courts into this business of determining when a corporation is going beyond its business."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1264.993,1271.245,"Well, I think it's a little late in the day, Justice Scalia, because that is precisely the standard the Court articulated in Reves."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1350.48,1374.032,"Okay, but I still think sooner or later we have to come back to something that you and I went over a moment ago, and that is the... one function, maybe the function, of... of the... of the... the entity claimed here is... is providing cover for the illegal status of the aliens."
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1385.519,1387.066,"Well, the... the--"
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1387.066,1391.863,--by... by the way that it is... allegedly provides phony Social Security cards.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1391.863,1396.162,"--Well, according to the allegation in paragraph 77, it just says obtaining illegal workers."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1401.272,1402.929,Where... where do we... you're going to have to help me out then.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1410.416,1410.76,--That's paragraph 76.
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1410.76,1411.807,Okay.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1411.807,1412.229,And that's a factual allegation.
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1414.432,1427.482,"But isn't that factual allegation, as a bare matter, sufficient to satisfy the objection that you raise, that something more than merely the activity... the conduct of... of their separate business is going on?"
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1427.482,1435.906,"--No, because what you still need... there's still a higher... it's not just the higher threshold that it's got to be something that moves beyond what the corporation does."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1440.969,1460.629,"Well, if... if, in fact, it is the case that Mohawk is... is providing the Social Security cards, isn't it directing the means by which the third... the third entity is, in effect, illegally... or supplying illegal workers in... in this... this joint enterprise?"
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1460.629,1473.32,"Well, obviously, we're going to disagree about this I think, but at the end of the day, I think the bottom line is what we're doing is when the applicant shows up at our doorstep or when they have, in fact, been hired, if for... and this is the allegation."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1487.307,1509.468,"Is it reasonable... is it reasonable to suppose, on the basis of reading the allegations as they have to be read at this stage of the proceeding... is it reasonable to infer that... from the allegation that there is an understanding between Mohawk and the employment agencies that Mohawk will provide this documentation and therefore make the scheme work?"
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1509.468,1512.422,"Well, it... the allegation certainly doesn't say that."
2005.05-465,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1512.422,1515.328,It doesn't say that in any... any black letter statement.
2005.05-465,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1515.328,1518.36,There is only one sentence in the allegation that even remotely says anything about this.
2005.05-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1555.679,1556.086,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1558.618,1559.368,Yes.
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1614.755,1626.023,"There may be no dispute about it, but it does seem kind of strange to encompass them under the term individuals when the same statute uses individuals and corporations separately."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1626.023,1627.148,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1675.282,1678.658,"Well, do you agree that that's an exhaustive list in subsection (4)?"
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1678.658,1682.127,"I don't think it's an exhaustive list, Justice Alito."
2005.05-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1697.302,1706.007,"Well, would you agree that includes is meant to be exhaustive in many of the other... in a number of the other subsections of this definitional provision?"
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1706.007,1707.445,I... I don't think so.
2005.05-465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.077,1756.924,"I don't see how your point regarding union helps you any because if... if you... if you win the point that union doesn't mean a labor union, you still have, as... as the end of this definition, any union or group of individuals."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1756.924,1757.424,Yes.
2005.05-465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.424,1760.237,A union of individuals or a group of individuals.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1761.799,1766.879,"Well, I think union is... it says union or group of individuals."
2005.05-465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.676,1773.223,Either union means labor union or it means a union or group of individuals.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1773.223,1779.912,"--I would... Justice Scalia, I don't believe that union means labor union because--"
2005.05-465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.912,1780.351,Okay.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1780.351,1781.727,--if it meant a labor union there--
2005.05-465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.727,1782.039,I'll give you that.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1784.509,1785.759,--A union or group of individuals.
2005.05-465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.759,1786.228,Right.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1788.321,1794.323,"Well, the word individual is not defined in the statute either, and--"
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1794.323,1801.449,"Well, it's not defined in the statute, but the prior list in the same sentence says individual, partnership, corporation."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1808.186,1816.89,"--The enterprise alleged here, Mr. Chief Justice, is actually not a single corporation."
2005.05-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.806,1860.354,There is--
2005.05-465,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1860.354,1865.027,"Still, it... it... you know, we usually talk about person can mean a corporation."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1878.154,1887.142,"Well, the use of the word union or group of individuals seems to broaden it."
2005.05-465,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1919.289,1922.79,I thought your position was it shouldn't be read at all because--
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1922.79,1923.617,Yes.
2005.05-465,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1923.617,1934.37,"--this... this Court is a court of review, and to take a question that was never certified, even to the court of appeals, to have this Court address it seems to me very strange."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1941.824,1943.121,"Well, I agree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-465,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1947.56,1951.656,"Well, what we're reviewing is a ruling, not a question."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1958.985,1960.547,--We are reviewing a ruling--
2005.05-465,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1960.547,1962.298,What you're reviewing here is a ruling.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,1962.298,1963.017,--It's a ruling.
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2015.357,2024.186,What is there different about your proceeding to treat this as a RICO enterprise that isn't covered by normal corporate criminal conspiracy law?
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2026.828,2028.031,--RICO does add more.
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.302,2051.755,So they hire more than one person.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2051.755,2060.179,"--They hired... and the association itself, Mr. Chief Justice, would have to exist over a... a significant period of time."
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2063.007,2072.821,"How is that different than a normal contractual relationship that a corporation is going to have with any number of suppliers, vendors, agents?"
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2072.821,2074.243,--Yes.
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2080.963,2085.51,"No, but I'm trying to see what RICO adds to the normal conspiracy law--"
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2085.51,2085.822,--Yes.
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2085.822,2087.48,--that would otherwise be applicable.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2092.589,2096.935,And then we have the pattern and the durational aspect of it.
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2106.812,2118.08,"But Congress didn't... to be fair, Congress did not enact RICO because it was concerned that criminal conspiracy law, applied to corporations, didn't adequately touch interstate commerce."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2130.457,2142.992,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, a RICO enterprise among... is a conspiracy to commit crime, but it's conspiracy plus."
2005.05-465,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2144.352,2146.024,But isn't... isn't the plus simply more than one act?
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2146.024,2148.196,--The plus is more than one act.
2005.05-465,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2148.868,2150.4,"So... so... no, but I mean literally."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2162.621,2171.561,"There would have to be at least two, and there would... it would have to go on to meet the Court's pattern requirement."
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.579,2192.456,I'm trying to give you a chance to explain why this looks like RICO rather than just criminal conspiracy.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2202.848,2219.711,"It's because we have a joint venture of entities operating over a long period of time that have victimized a large number of people, and there's a pattern of racketeering activity."
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2220.118,2223.463,There's a pattern because they hired more than one.
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2223.463,2224.385,--They hired more than one.
2005.05-465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.77,2284.163,"Yes, but Reves demonstrates that... that your statement earlier that since it was fraudulent action, it couldn't have been the business of the corporation is simply false."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2295.462,2310.543,"--Here, Justice Scalia, there is, as was pointed out earlier in the dialogue with Justice Souter, a very close cooperation among Mohawk and these third parties to get workers, to bring them from--"
2005.05-465,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.543,2313.872,"I understand that, but that's... we have to get into that is my point."
2005.05-465,1,26983,howard_w_foster,,2321.624,2323.531,"--Yes, I agree."
2005.05-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.384,2442.665,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2443.68,2453.574,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-465,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2546.22,2572.975,"Why shouldn't includes here be read to mean means when that seems to be the way it's used in other subsections of this provision and when the only thing that seems to be... if this is not an exhaustive list, the only thing that seems possibly to be omitted from the list is what's involved here, which is a group consisting of a corporation or other legal... other legal entity and... and natural persons."
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2572.975,2574.241,--I think there are several reasons.
2005.05-465,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.106,2612.531,"Do... do any of those cases that you allude to that have means in some sections and includes in others... do any of them have in third sections, includes, comma, without limitation, comma?"
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2612.531,2614.124,"--No, but the... the includes--"
2005.05-465,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.124,2615.655,"Well, I think that's a big difference."
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2615.655,2624.094,"--I think it would be a big difference if the phrase, including but not limited to, appeared in another provision of 1961, but that's not where the phrase appears."
2005.05-465,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.095,2630.878,Close enough.
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2630.878,2641.988,"--where the word includes stood alone within that section, it was natural for Congress to use what we call a... a belt and suspenders approach, making it clear that the word includes shouldn't be taken as exclusive."
2005.05-465,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.17,2705.269,"Yes, but if we're trying to think of what they were getting at, it's possible that Congress was worried about organized crime taking over the pizza parlor or taking over a trades union or taking over a similar kind of enterprise."
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2721.772,2723.225,"--Well, I don't think--"
2005.05-465,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2723.225,2740.011,But... but they had no reason whatsoever for doing the same thing for what we have are associations of trade unions with each other or associations of... of corporations with each other.
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2796.569,2814.385,"--I mean, in terms of speculation about Congress's motive, I think you're very likely right that the reason Congress added a specific reference to groups of individuals was that they were thinking in terms of mob families or syndicates, criminal gangs that had no discrete status as a legal entity."
2005.05-465,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2847.346,2849.425,You're... you're willing to go this far with them.
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2875.571,2876.212,--Exactly.
2005.05-465,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2881.276,2881.463,All right.
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2899.545,2901.952,--There... there is in the legislative history.
2005.05-465,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2927.535,2931.536,"Mr. Stewart, this... this thing is at least... at least... ambiguous."
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2952.369,2953.072,"--First, I--"
2005.05-465,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.072,2954.322,--resolve this question?
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2954.322,2961.808,"--I don't think that at the end of the day, after all the tools of statutory construction are applied, there is a genuine and certainly not a grievous ambiguity."
2005.05-465,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.998,2973.326,That's irrelevant because it's not taken alone.
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2980.515,2989.61,--The... the only question is whether this list should be taken to exclude things that are not on the list even though they would otherwise be encompassed by the normal meaning of the word enterprise.
2005.05-465,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.958,3019.493,"Even... even when it's absolutely clear and... and as pointed out by... by your friend, you... you did not refute the point that in other sections where it says includes, it is unquestionable that it is exclusive."
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3019.493,3027.181,"That... that was part of Justice Alito's question, and I think there are two different senses in which a statutory list could be considered exclusive or comprehensive."
2005.05-465,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3093.336,3098.774,"Well, a State attorney... a State attorney general wouldn't fall within subsection 10."
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3101.119,3127.438,"I... I agree with that, but I don't think that in the context of a Federal statute referring to the Attorney General, a State attorney general would typically be encompassed within the meaning of that provision even if that provision were undefined, whereas I think because executive power is... is generally deemed to be delegable, subordinate officials standing in the shoes of a cabinet officer would usually be thought to be encompassed by the reference to the cabinet officer alone."
2005.05-465,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.473,3149.584,"What's the best court of appeals opinion, the most thoroughly considered?"
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3153.553,3167.04,"I've looked at them and... I would agree with Mr. Phillips that the analysis doesn't tend to be lengthy, but I think Feldman would be one."
2005.05-465,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3182.903,3185.279,Are there any dissents in any of those cases?
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3185.279,3188.388,--I don't recall any dissents at least on the point.
2005.05-465,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3199.624,3221.474,"Do any of the court of appeals opinions deal specifically with the peculiarity of this definition in which, although it starts out with the word includes, then follows a... a listing, A, B, C, and D, and then it repeats one, but only one, of the items on the list and says groups of these items, i.e., individuals, are included?"
2005.05-465,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3226.177,3232.788,I don't know of any court of appeals opinion that really focus on that... focuses on that aspect of the question.
