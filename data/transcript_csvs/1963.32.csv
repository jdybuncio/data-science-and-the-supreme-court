1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,21.372,25.601,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,225.49,230.472,These all the doctors are in or around at Ludington or in Michigan?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,230.472,234.564,"Almost all were in Ludington, Dr. Boelkins was in Grand Rapids, Michigan."
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,234.564,236.874,"How far is Ludington to Grand Rapids, about 40 or 50 miles?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,236.874,237.421,60 miles.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,237.421,239.152,60 miles.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,239.152,256.399,"The situation came according to his affidavit, which is contained at pages 72 to 74 of the record that his physical situation was such that he was getting no relief, the company had a promised him a specialist."
1963.32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,487.568,497.182,"Mr. Naughton, do you agree with this possible (Inaudible)?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,497.182,507.521,"Yes Your Honor, I would -- based on the -- on the Interlocutory Appeals Act, I would think that it could've been certified by the petitioner here of Judge Parsons and could've been --"
1963.32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,507.521,508.758,(Inaudible)
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,508.758,509.921,They did not request that.
1963.32,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,509.921,514.802,(Inaudible) is that correct?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,514.802,515.869,Yes Your Honor.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.869,519.082,"It should have required a certification though on your view by the District Judge, is it not?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,519.082,527.758,"Yes, I would think that Judge Parsons in his case would have certified the matter under the Interlocutory Appeals Act if that request had been made."
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,529.566,535.047,But would the state court transfer (Voice Overlap) --
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,535.047,535.394,Mr. Justice Brennan?
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,535.394,542.534,But could the state court transfer order in contrast appealable for like --
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,542.534,543.029,Yes.
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.029,544.045,-- state of appellant court?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,544.045,545.538,That was appealable.
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,568.421,571.218,"The state court decision was a dismissable, was it?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,571.218,571.958,"Yes, it was Your Honor."
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,571.958,573.191,It's not a transfer of course.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,575.716,576.826,It was outright dismissal.
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,580.404,582.524,Yes.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,582.524,603.459,"Now, such a decision it seems to me involves elements of discretion and of matters that are peculiar to the Court deciding the motion which are so sui generis that I would not think they should be the basis of a -- of the doctrine of res judicata or of estoppel by verdict in the later proceedings."
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,703.018,705.206,How far is Ludington from Grand Rapids?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,705.206,708.97,60 miles Your Honor.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,983.667,986.93,Does state court make any findings of fact?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,986.93,987.557,"No, Your Honor."
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,989.695,990.76,Simply an order of dismissal?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,990.76,1002.92,"Simply an order, which can be said to make a finding of fact that it was an inconvenient inappropriate forum, the majority opinion does so find."
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.92,1005.142,But there were no explicit findings were there?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1005.142,1006.875,There were no explicit findings.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1006.875,1008.751,Of fact?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1015.912,1020.813,That's the Cotton versus L. & N. R. R. case cited in the both party's briefs.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1020.813,1030.531,And there is as I understand it an additional -- in Illinois law an additional consideration which the Court has required to consider that as when the action was brought to harass or vex the railroad?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1030.531,1034.298,Purely vex and harass the railroad.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1034.298,1035.156,Is that --
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1035.156,1036.008,That is the standard.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.008,1036.986,That's the only standard?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1036.986,1038.215,That is the only standard.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1038.215,1045.01,The Court of Appeals here says that that's a -- that the Illinois Court has all the federal standards plus that standard.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1045.01,1047.839,"Well, that is a --"
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1047.839,1048.892,Maybe I misread the Court of Appeals opinion.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1048.892,1050.272,That's what the Court of Appeals says.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1119.088,1121.257,"The plaintiff was a resident there, isn't it?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1121.257,1122.574,The plaintiff was a resident at Ludington --
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1122.574,1122.737,Yes.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1122.737,1124.412,-- where there is a state court.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1124.412,1126.366,In the district -- in the district?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1126.366,1127.647,"It is in the district, yes."
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1127.647,1130.727,-- district of Michigan and the accident happened there?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1130.727,1132.54,The accident happened there.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1162.206,1172.851,Do you quarrel with the -- do you question the -- do you question the availability of a writ of mandamus in appropriate circumstances and --
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1172.851,1173.011,Yes.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1173.011,1174.705,"-- of course you know, you do question that?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1174.705,1175.311,Yes sir.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.311,1176.712,At all?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1176.712,1180.052,"The writ of mandamus and the 1404 (a), yes, sir."
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1180.052,1180.766,You do?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1180.766,1195.695,"I do it on two bases, one that I think an interlocutory appeal was the proper method of questioning it and two, I think that this type of discretionary orders are not such -- it create extraordinary circumstances that writs of mandamus should be considered by Courts of Appeal."
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1195.695,1206.182,Haven't the Courts of Appeals rather generally said that mandamus is available I -- and apply different standards as to when the mandamus will be granted?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1206.182,1208.314,I would say there's a conflict in the circuits of course.
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1208.314,1213.01,As to even the availability of this?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1213.49,1217.749,"Respondent check -- cites one of the cases, which says that it is not available."
1963.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1217.749,1229.159,"I think one or two of them, the Second Circuit for instance that made a distinction saying it's available if the transfer is denied but not available if it's granted or vice versa, are you (Inaudible) with that?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1229.159,1230.165,"Yes, sir."
1963.32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.85,1264.58,"Would you -- would you concede that if the state court had considered the same facts, say there was a state rules, the federal rules on transfer to say and it had been determined against you in the state court, then would the federal court be bound by these state court's determinations?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1264.58,1272.791,"I would say no on that -- on the basis, that full faith and credit and estoppel by verdict do not apply."
1963.32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.157,1289.117,You would think the District Court would have the absolute obligation of retrying the whole matter and coming to its own conclusion on the motion to transfer?Is there identical rule?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1289.117,1289.781,Well --
1963.32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.781,1289.858,Is there identical rule?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1289.858,1298.1,-- I would say that the District Court probably as a matter of comity would recognize the -- the almost identical determination.
1963.32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.1,1307.42,Would you -- even though he might come out -- he might have come out himself to a different conclusion?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1307.42,1316.892,It's -- I don't see how the fact that a District Court has had a -- has a case which has a previous state ruling and it can evade this responsibility.
1963.32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.892,1325.758,From the identical -- from the identical question would the identical standards applied?
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1325.758,1329.39,I would still say that he would not be bound absolutely by that.
1963.32,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.39,1336.408,"No, no estoppel -- no full faith and credit, there was nothing applies to this?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1336.408,1343.893,"Well, even in such circumstances, the -- these standards are crystal clear. They are matters for the individual judge."
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1353.637,1362.074,"Well, Mr. Naughton, you might -- might you have voluntarily dismiss that state court action and then brought this in the District Court?"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1362.074,1363.192,"Yes, sir."
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1363.192,1363.394,And I gather that --
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1363.394,1365.607,That's the -- that's a counsel for the plaintiff.
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1365.607,1367.522,That's what I mean.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1388.32,1392.066,"Yes, I would say this is the usual rule."
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1408.911,1409.387,"Well, I was going a little (Voice Overlap) --"
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1409.387,1410.312,-- subsequent proceedings.
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1411.181,1412.306,I was going a little beyond that.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1431.406,1432.88,That's correct.
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1432.88,1433.324,And it's because --
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1433.324,1433.406,It would so Your Honor.
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1433.406,1440.83,And because you ought to flow from that is that he's not bound by anything that happens necessarily short of a decision on the merits of his claim.
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1440.83,1441.39,Yes.
1963.32,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1441.546,1444.139,(Inaudible)
1963.32,0,32193,john_j_naughton,,1444.139,1463.673,"That is the only decision we would submit that by which it should be bound as a decision on the merits or decision extending estoppel by verdict to questions of fact determined not questions of -- really, what our value judgment should not determine these rights in the second forum."
1963.32,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1574.113,1576.487,Mr. O'Laughlin.
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,1576.487,1581.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.32,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1757.002,1794.577,(Inaudible)
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,1794.577,1807.076,"Yes, but I would say that certainly it would be a no rule in Illinois that a case could be dismissed under forum non conveniens, on a pure showing of vexation."
1963.32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1892.19,1901.691,"Well, Mr. O'Laughlin, I gather you didn't take the position that the plaintiff, the FELA plaintiff could not go down the street two blocks and file his lawsuit there, did you?"
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,1901.691,1905.791,"Well, Your Honor -- and I address myself to the same question that you ask the counsel here."
1963.32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1905.791,1906.777,Yes.
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,1906.777,1912.635,"Of course, the plaintiff could sue where -- where he could get jurisdiction of the railroad."
1963.32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1929.386,1939.305,"Well, what I want to get clear was, there was nothing about the state court proceeding which barred him from bringing his federal court suit two blocks down the street."
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,1942.189,1942.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1942.698,1948.463,The federal transfer rule in order to defeat the trial of this case in the district where he brought it.
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,1948.463,1948.592,Yes.
1963.32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1954.568,1956.61,That's what I'm trying to get here.
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,1956.61,1961.132,"No, I would suppose that there was no adjudication on the -- on the merits."
1963.32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2012.335,2023.689,It may not be relevant Mr. O'Laughlin but might the Railroad -- might jurisdiction of an action against the Railroad had been obtained in a Federal District Court actually in Grand Rapids?
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2023.689,2039.558,"Oh yes, that was clearly a place where the action might have been brought within the language of 1404 (a)."
1963.32,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2281.948,2290.837,Do you discount the fact that (Inaudible)?
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2290.837,2292.84,I do not discount that Your Honor.
1963.32,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2297.762,2307.039,"Was there a fact that writ of mandamus (Inaudible), is that correct?"
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2307.039,2311.833,"Well, I would just to say it is to answer it."
1963.32,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2317.359,2327.204,Then do you assume (Inaudible) that this writ of mandamus is not (Inaudible)?
1963.32,1,19747,charles_j_olaughlin,,2327.204,2334.184,"The reason we did not do so -- seek this, of course, it was found in the first requirement."
1963.32,2,32193,john_j_naughton,,2918.973,2921.845,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.32,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2934.247,2935.814,"Oh, the docket of the District Court?"
1963.32,2,32193,john_j_naughton,,2935.814,2938.223,Of the Circuit Court of Cook County Your Honor.
1963.32,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2938.223,2941.359,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1963.32,2,32193,john_j_naughton,,2941.359,2948.931,"I would also state that at page 46 of the record, he complained of the crowded dockets of the United States District Court."
1963.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3008.715,3017.292,"That statute wouldn't apply -- well, it might arguably apply in this case where the question was a res judicata controlling question of law."
1963.32,2,32193,john_j_naughton,,3033.846,3038.396,"As I understand that Mr. O'Laughlin is wrong, this case would not be in the same posture."
1963.32,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3066.542,3069.139,We'll recess now.
