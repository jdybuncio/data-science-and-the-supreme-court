2011.11-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We will hear argument this morning in case 11-161, Armour v. City of Indianapolis."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,9.289,14.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,110.618,114.237,"Counsel, I understand your arguments."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,153.362,155.23,"No, Your Honor, for several reasons."
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,171.74,179.06,"Every time a police officer stops me for a traffic violation, I get angry when he lets somebody else go."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,189.451,190.084,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,225.458,228.577,I thought there were a lot more than 20 different lots.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,242.217,244.752,"--No, Your Honor, and State law on this is quite clear."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,244.752,247.638,I don't care what the State says; I'm saying a matter as a constitutional law.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,247.638,250.073,"Well, constitutional law looks to State law."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,251.692,251.942,Okay.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,251.942,253.892,But I will back up.
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,270.386,284.329,"Well, why in the State, when they have let's say, 10,000 people who have already paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to give them back their money, on your theory?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,286.413,288.031,--Because they are not similarly situated.
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,288.531,289.048,Why aren't they?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,289.048,294.202,--Because your -- the States have flexibility to define at the outset who is similarly situated.
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,294.202,294.485,Okay.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,300.439,303.557,"No, Your Honor, but they have a basis for stating that."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,304.474,304.807,They do.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,332.041,333.076,--Your Honor--
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,333.076,334.16,This is where are we drawing it.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,336.528,338.178,--That's not what this Court's cases say.
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,343.849,346.051,"I mean -- My point, I'm not making it clear."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,371.951,372.968,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,403.405,406.357,"Mr. Stancil, who are these people?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,437.942,445.832,"If we are correct, the city will end up paying a little more than in our specific case but I would like to explain why and how much because it's an important distinction."
2011.11-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,483.336,485.538,That counts as a gross disparity?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,485.538,489.073,I don't think that counts as a gross disparity.
2011.11-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,489.073,490.573,"Well, what does is my question."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,493.941,495.393,"Well, start with this case, which is easy."
2011.11-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.45,519.858,"If -- if you win, does -- does the city just have to give you enough to bring it down to 5 to 1 so it's no longer a gross disparity?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,519.858,521.208,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,576.429,579.797,"But that isn't the administrative -- the administrative -- well, maybe that's one."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,630.079,630.765,Two reasons.
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,672.592,683.448,"You see, the problem that I have is that you're trying to lop off half of the project, which is was what was the Barrett project -- without looking at what the new project is."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,715.685,716.269,"No, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,740.284,745.854,But it -- but it says that new people are going to pay a flat fee.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,750.758,751.325,--Right.
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,751.325,770.172,"And so why can't they come in, and why don't they come in and say exactly what Justice Breyer said: You forgave the payments of taxes for hooking up to the sewer system of these new people coming in."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,771.572,780.444,"They should -- there's nobody who will pay more under the new system than my clients, because the new people pay $2,500 and the same monthly fees that now every Indiana resident pays."
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,780.444,783.396,"Well, so everybody else says I want to pay $2,500."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,811.599,816.284,"But that's because under this Court's equal protection cases, they have to have a reason for this particular line."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,820.271,823.14,I might have missed a fact which -- which I'd like to know.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,836.948,837.798,--Yes.
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.966,840.8,They're in various states.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,845.32,848.939,They all got refunds -- or their balances were completely forgiven.
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.939,849.422,Okay.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,876.441,878.808,"Look -- let me make clear, 2 through 20 are--"
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,878.808,879.643,Am I arguing the facts?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,879.643,880.243,--I'm not sure.
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.945,884.295,Yes.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,884.762,885.464,--So they owe less money.
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,889.649,890.066,Right.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,890.066,894.32,"--9,000, but Joe over here got his last $1,000 forgiven."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.087,895.087,Yes.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,895.087,896.937,"The mayor says, I talked to my lawyers."
2011.11-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.065,925.789,"I think -- I think that Justice Breyer is suggesting that if you treat unconstitutionally a whole lot of people, you can get away with it."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,926.906,929.891,"Oddly enough, I was not suggesting that."
2011.11-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.26,939.699,"Counsel, some -- some time ago, I thought you were just about to tell us how much money the city says will be at stake if you prevail."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,939.699,943.901,"--In my case, there's $273,391.63."
2011.11-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,953.523,960.445,"And -- the city says that's the total amount that's at issue if you prevail, if the taxpayers prevail on this claim."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,960.445,962.278,That's -- that's what it said in Cox.
2011.11-161,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,962.862,969.384,Could the city cure the problem by rescinding the forgiveness for those who paid under the installment plan?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,969.384,969.918,"No, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,969.918,970.701,Why not?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,970.701,973.003,This was specifically addressed in Allegheny Pittsburgh.
2011.11-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.857,983.892,"You wouldn't have any incentive to bring a lawsuit if that were the remedy, would you?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,983.892,984.311,Right.
2011.11-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.194,985.894,So effectively--
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,985.894,988.43,--I'm unpopular in Indianapolis as it is.
2011.11-161,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.583,997.952,Why isn't that a choice for the legislature?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1022.917,1025.619,"It was a legislative choice, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1047.885,1054.972,"Mr. Stancil, if that's right, and let's take a case which is different from the one that -- that you're saying."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1081.706,1088.343,"--Well, again, I agree with Justice Scalia that making a big mess isn't a justification for arbitrarily ending it."
2011.11-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1088.343,1098.568,"Well, but I -- I guess what I'm asking is, we have this terrible program; everybody hates it; it's not fulfilling its intended purposes; the mayor and everybody else wants to change it."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1101.02,1102.886,There are two ways he could have changed this program.
2011.11-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1106.205,1107.007,I'm suggesting--
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1107.007,1107.39,--I know--
2011.11-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1107.39,1110.375,--that that is financially prohibitive.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1110.375,1113.51,"--I will pay for it then, because he can go and he could -- he could have done two things here."
2011.11-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.349,1133.389,--Have we ever decided an equal protection case on the basis that the -- the State who had violated the -- the Constitution can't afford to pay for it?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1135.791,1136.526,"No, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1136.526,1137.076,It's just too expensive?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1137.076,1137.593,No.
2011.11-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.593,1140.228,"And, therefore, we have to deny equal protection?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1140.228,1141.445,"No, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1142.028,1143.597,"Well, isn't that what you are saying, Mr. Stancil?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1150.6,1151.1,--No.
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1292.423,1298.244,That is the park -- parking amnesty example that you have said wasn't the same.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1305.267,1306.1,Well--
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1306.1,1314.288,So you really are saying that amnesty programs are out of the question if the risk is imposed equally on everyone.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1314.288,1315.038,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1332.667,1337.036,"No, but you are saying if you forgive the parking ticket, that's an equal protection violation."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1337.036,1338.838,"--No, Your -- I mean, I would not, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.19,1342.84,The goal here is very simple.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1375.177,1377.029,"--It's not, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1377.663,1380.231,"It's not their rationale, or it's not perfect?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1380.231,1381.065,"--It's not reasonable, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1385.052,1386.569,It's not impossible.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1416.421,1421.225,"--Your Honor, I mean -- there's one -- there's somebody not here in this case that I think belies this notion--"
2011.11-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1421.225,1421.475,Right.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1421.475,1426.093,--That this is going against the tax code broadly or amnesty forgiveness decisions generally.
2011.11-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1439.019,1443.971,Is there an easier thing to administer than the system that was struck down in Allegheny Pittsburgh?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1443.971,1445.006,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1445.006,1446.94,"When you paid, that's what your assessment was."
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1452.66,1456.981,"Correct, Your Honor, and again, the administrative burden there was actually quite significant."
2011.11-161,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.981,1462.1,You don't believe in the administrative nightmare exception to the Equal Protection Clause?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1463.652,1464.968,Not when it takes only three pages.
2011.11-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.968,1490.619,"Can you tell me -- I'm curious to know, if other States have provisions like the Barrett Law and they are concerned about this, can they provide in the initial documents a -- a promise that there will be no forgiveness, so that there would be a contract clause sort of argument against what happened here?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1499.808,1501.843,"Well, there are four--"
2011.11-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.843,1504.629,And maybe not a promise in the contract sense.
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1504.629,1504.929,--Yes.
2011.11-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1537.716,1557.779,"On the other aspect of my case, do you think other States could provide protection against this, in the event that you do not prevail here, and -- and put in the documents that -- that it is understood that a condition for your approving of this -- these sewers, will be that there will be no forgiveness?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1557.779,1559.663,"--I suppose they could, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1560.548,1563.583,"Would that then be enforceable under the Contract Clause, do you think?"
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1563.583,1567.952,--I'm not sure it would be under -- under the Contract Clause.
2011.11-161,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1581.212,1581.679,Give you a warning?
2011.11-161,0,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1581.679,1582.129,Right.
2011.11-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.299,1589.149,"Thank you, Mr. Stancil."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1593.202,1596.071,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1623.606,1640.433,"I think you've put your finger on the reason for this, which is that the city calculated that what it did would be more politically acceptable than treating the people who paid upfront equally on an economic basis with the people who paid in installment plans."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1642.785,1645.737,"--Well, Justice Alito, it -- it might well be rational."
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1656.06,1658.895,"But what does that mean, they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law business?"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1658.895,1659.962,--That -- can I put it very concretely?
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1680.208,1684.696,That really doesn't seem very complicated to collect payments that people have agreed to pay.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1693.302,1697.004,"Well, Justice Alito, of course they could have continued to collect."
2011.11-161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1729.308,1737.164,"And so, I think maybe if you prevail in this opinion, we should say the principle we are adopting in this case is: Don't trust the government."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1737.164,1739.947,"No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that that's right."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1763.126,1770.966,"Well, that's simply because, as we said in Allegheny Pittsburgh, the basis for considering the equal protection claim is the rights that you're given under State law."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1798.484,1800.651,"Two differences, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1833.939,1839.793,The change in policy -- the change in policy is from treating people equally to treating people unequally.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1856.322,1861.357,"--No, I -- with respect, I think it's the change that makes this case different from Allegheny Pittsburgh."
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1883.389,1894.178,"Other than political expediency and administrative convenience, I still don't understand what rational basis you claim there was for the distinction that was drawn."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1899.982,1902.534,"--Well, you know, I count five, Justice Alito."
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1934.821,1940.975,"There is lots of reasons for not giving refunds, but what are the reasons for forgiving the debt that people agreed to?"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1940.975,1942.075,"--Well, okay."
2011.11-161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1956.484,1961.388,You don't dispute that the city would have that option if we rule against you.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1961.388,1963.673,"Have the option what, Mr. Justice Kennedy?"
2011.11-161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1963.673,1967.125,Not to forgive the unpaid balances.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1968.775,1971.094,They certainly have the option in the future.
2011.11-161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2008.369,2009.152,That's a big difference.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2012.321,2017.892,"No, Mr. Justice Kennedy, because the expectation here is at the time of Resolution 101."
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.055,2050.196,Because you would eliminate all litigation on equal protection clause grounds if all that the Plaintiff is going to achieve is not any benefit to him but harming somebody else.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2076.263,2078.798,"No, I think what they said--"
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.798,2083.517,"--They said that men would have to drink at 18, not that women will have to wait until 21."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2083.517,2084.952,"--No, I think they said that was with respect--"
2011.11-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2084.952,2085.819,It could go either way.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2085.819,2086.102,--Exactly.
2011.11-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2086.102,2089.154,It was up to the Oklahoma legislature.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2092.523,2096.76,And the city retains that option in this case going forward.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2110.585,2111.27,Right.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2112.287,2113.889,I think you are dealing with an entirely different case.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2113.889,2124.244,"--If the law that created the violation is Resolution 101, than the remedy in every other area of constitutional law, including sex discrimination, is clearly that the State has the option."
2011.11-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2132.7,2147.293,"Then you are saying that the difference between the two classes is that if you continue to have the tax apply to the people who haven't paid it yet, there is a large administrative expense."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2196.108,2197.043,"Sure, there is, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.671,2218.556,But here the State has defined the class.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2236.535,2242.738,"I would have thought, Justice Scalia, that this was an equal protection case, not a contracts case, not a Winstar case, not an estoppel case."
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.283,2268.972,So you are saying that any future law which -- which disregards an equal classification that a prior law established is okay?
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2271.524,2271.824,It--
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.824,2273.876,There will always be a future law that does it.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2273.876,2275.36,"--No, it -- it could be."
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.328,2277.878,Yes.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2280.03,2280.514,Right.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2299.943,2300.427,Excuse me.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2344.722,2350.293,"--With all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, you are making this sound like it's an estoppel case, like it's a Winstar case."
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2394.003,2399.207,"Well, they want forgiveness, but you outline correctly in your brief the fact that the city had three options."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2433.28,2441.184,"Justice Alito, as I hear you, you have switched from rational basis to, it has to be, you know, a net -- unless we can show a net loss, we lose."
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2456.745,2469.87,"It's rational for a city to say that it costs us $100,000 to collect this money, and if we do collect it, we are going to bring in $500,000, so we don't want to pay the $100,000, so we are going to get rid of the program?"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2470.47,2473.941,"--It is rational, Justice Alito, because they have to maintain an office to do it."
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2475.957,2481.611,"If the net -- if the net cost -- if it's a net gain, what is the rationality of abandoning it?"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2481.611,2485.646,--Because they want to get rid of the office; they want to get out of the business; they want to make a clean break.
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2515.768,2516.484,You put your finger on it.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2541.083,2543.501,"--No, it's not what it's about, the way you're describing it."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.226,2558.428,There is a provision -- you said I would search in vein for this provision in the Barrett Law.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2558.428,2558.895,--Yes.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2558.895,2560.547,"Well, I went and searched and 15--"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2567.866,2572.104,"Yes, that's the -- I -- I -- that's the provision I already mentioned about appraisals."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2573.737,2574.087,It says costs.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2574.087,2578.091,--The cost of the project when they are doing the appraisal.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2606.326,2616.649,"Where -- where do I look to find that when they say the costs shall be apportioned equally, they are not referring to the costs, but they were referring to the assessments?"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2616.649,2621.87,"They are referring to the costs of the project, the improvement."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2623.437,2631.393,"The costs of the project are funded by the -- the sewer hook-ups, and some people pay 400 and some people paid 10,000."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2631.393,2636.38,--But it's the costs that are then reflected in the assessment on each lot.
2011.11-161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2648.437,2655.608,That just -- that just underscores the promise of the State or the city that all owners will be treated equally.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2660.412,2662.345,"With respect, that's not."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2716.665,2718.615,You just said it's not popularity.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2726.288,2727.605,It's just popularity.
2011.11-161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2919.528,2921.394,"Well, why -- why is that -- why is that a big deal for us?"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2923.413,2925.496,--Okay.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2951.063,2953.265,You -- you mentioned Heckler v. Mathews.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2963.204,2963.721,--Yes.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2963.721,2971.744,"So while it is true that you can cure a violation by levelling up or levelling down, ordinarily, extension of the benefit is the proper course."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2976.196,2980.0,"If that were the rule, Heckler v. Mathews would have come out the other way."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2981.616,2983.468,"Well, what wrong -- what did the Court mean when they said"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2986.153,2990.871,"--Well, they were talking about a specific situation and a Federal law."
2011.11-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.115,3038.252,What -- what do you think would happen if the city says -- if it came out that way -- we really want to give refunds.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3052.229,3054.148,--And -- and in what amount?
2011.11-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3054.148,3069.057,"And you heard your -- your -- your friend try to -- make a distinction between this project, and you wouldn't have to give the money, he said, to every other person -- whoever back in 1850 or 1890 or whenever it was -- began to make Barrett Law payments."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3072.992,3074.544,"Well, you're absolutely right."
2011.11-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.944,3076.913,"Right, because it's a question."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3076.913,3078.646,--Okay.
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.465,3083.581,I don't understand that why.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3085.683,3088.119,--With respect to--
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.119,3099.51,"--if people come forward and say I'm one of the ones who paid the lump sum, I want a refund; and if somebody doesn't come and present such a claim, the city doesn't pay."
2011.11-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.61,3101.343,That's right.
2011.11-161,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.343,3102.794,--Surely the city has records.
2011.11-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.794,3107.68,"Let me try to get my question, which is, I'm not -- I'm thinking this is project 1."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3138.468,3141.42,"--Well, with respect, what I heard him say is we probably would."
2011.11-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3154.244,3157.113,"How many people does that involve, about?"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3157.113,3160.648,--It involves -- I don't know -- I know the number of projects.
2011.11-161,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3167.487,3169.487,Was his figure of $2 million accurate?
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3171.903,3176.474,--The -- the stakes in the other case without interest I think are $2.7 million.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3180.009,3182.711,"When -- when you say ""the other case"", do you mean every other project?"
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3185.58,3187.865,It -- it's a class action that tops the Federal litigation.
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3223.686,3230.173,"Well, if everybody -- if everybody entitled to a refund came forward, it would cost you $2.7 million."
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3230.173,3232.356,"--No, actually it would -- plus this one."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3233.458,3234.508,Okay.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3250.836,3252.486,"Well, I mean--"
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3252.486,3255.388,The most it's going to cost is $3 million.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3255.388,3255.888,"--Yes, in this case."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3275.119,3277.404,Amnesty -- I don't get -- amnesty is entirely different.
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3285.608,3286.274,"But Mr. Chief Justice, it's -- it's the same principle."
2011.11-161,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3306.687,3310.073,What can you do with the hypothetical about the income tax and the sales tax?
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3314.608,3320.845,"--I think if they really got rid of the -- the Federal tax forever, I don't think there wouldn't be an equal protection violation."
2011.11-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3358.987,3370.611,Is there some identified or identifiable demographic difference between the two groups that either justifies or could on -- on a remand justify the different treatment?
2011.11-161,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3370.611,3373.629,"--Well, I think the one -- I don't think there is a demographic difference."
2011.11-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3401.546,3402.079,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-161,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3403.998,3406.95,"Justice Alito, I want to just pick up right there."
2011.11-161,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3436.802,3439.102,"Mr. Stancil, here is what worries me about this case."
2011.11-161,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3482.681,3486.919,If you've promised equal treatment -- and we're talking about a -- this is a -- a specific case.
2011.11-161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3524.558,3526.691,"Well, time is usually a rational reason for doing it."
2011.11-161,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3538.116,3539.166,If we -- I'm sorry.
2011.11-161,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3539.918,3542.603,Suppose that there had never been the option of making the lump sum payment.
2011.11-161,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3555.142,3555.492,--Right.
2011.11-161,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3597.754,3605.675,"The argument isn't that it's expensive to administer as much as it is, there are 1,000 people in all these projects who are already paid up."
2011.11-161,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3618.418,3619.735,"Well, if that's the case--"
2011.11-161,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3619.735,3621.287,"The question is, I guess, is, is that rational."
2011.11-161,2,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3621.287,3621.953,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.11-161,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3631.84,3632.459,"Thank you, counsel."
