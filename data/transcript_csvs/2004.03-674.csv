2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.653,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-674, Keyse Jama v. the INS."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,53.915,57.425,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.514,108.944,"Mr. Keyes, we're not talking about removability here, are we, I mean, in the sense that a dispute over whether he could be removed?"
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,111.09,111.833,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.009,146.013,"May I ask you preliminarily, Mr. Keyes?"
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,190.224,207.852,"Your Honor, the... the statute, as structured, sets forth... Congress has set forth order with respect to the deportation process, has set forth, for example, the order in which countries should be chosen, the identity of those countries that should be chosen."
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.125,256.065,"But you need more than that, don't you?"
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,272.246,282.072,"Mr. Chief Justice, the... the... we are not contending that the... the statute invests a right on the individual."
2004.03-674,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.103,304.902,"Well, but it is possible to read the statute, particularly part (E), the first series of subsections of it, as the Eighth Circuit did."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,313.28,315.443,"Your Honor, I would... I would suggest that--"
2004.03-674,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.443,317.384,Or I should say clauses perhaps.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,317.384,317.922,"--Yes, yes."
2004.03-674,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.612,329.067,Yes.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,329.067,341.222,"However, the... I would suggest that that would... that would take subparagraph (E) out of... out of its context, and there are several very important... there's important--"
2004.03-674,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.222,342.603,"Well, I... I'm not sure that's right."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,361.534,375.196,"--Your Honor, I would... I would suggest that that... that is... that's not the case for the following reasons, that first of all, the way (E) begins, it says, if an alien is not removed to a country under the previous subparagraphs."
2004.03-674,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.196,375.773,Right.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,375.773,383.825,"The first priority is... before that is country of subject, nationality, or citizenship where there is an acceptance requirement."
2004.03-674,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.477,390.391,"Well, obviously Congress prefers to have a country act with acceptance."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,410.248,416.192,"--Your Honor, the... the... what (E) does is that it doesn't change the removal process."
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.564,426.8,"Well, but it doesn't begin that way."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,447.771,448.764,Your Honor--
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.764,455.18,"So when it says if he is not, then the... the Attorney General has these additional options."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,459.826,474.398,"--Your Honor, the... the... when it says, if an alien is not removed to a country under the previous subparagraphs, that... that is moving to give the Attorney General additional countries to remove to."
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.89,513.861,"Of course, well, I mean, that clause could... could be read either way."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,525.835,526.828,It is... it is--
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.828,528.89,And that's... that's the... that's the ambiguity there.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,528.89,563.07,"--It... it does depend upon the emphasis that you give, but I would suggest that if we are going to... if we are going to read (E) to mean that what the Congress intended was that you're going to have an acceptance requirement for removal under (D), step two, the subject, nation, or citizenship country, but then we're going to move to (E) and we're going to give you a list of other countries that are presumably less... or have a less closer connection to the alien than in (D)."
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,583.875,584.618,Do you know why?
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,604.12,605.029,--I... I... we didn't--
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,605.029,605.856,Do we know... is there anything?
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,609.793,613.408,--It... it... we didn't find anything that explained why.
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,619.89,620.14,"--Yes, it does."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,635.744,639.088,"--That's... that... that is correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.088,639.171,"Otherwise, you could argue--"
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,639.171,640.081,That is correct.
2004.03-674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,665.837,674.093,"One... one argument in... at least in my view, that would certainly help you in your reading of (E) is the interpretation that you put on (D)."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,754.137,755.085,"Two reasons, Your Honor."
2004.03-674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,767.966,770.771,"Well, it says the Attorney General shall remove unless."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,783.609,794.549,"--And... and I would... I would suggest that the... the consequence of the unless language should be that unless this happens, don't do it."
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.064,879.71,"What I think is very strange is the... is... is for you to read back up to all the other clauses, (i) through (vi), the phrase, whose government will accept the alien."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,903.487,925.035,The... the... I think that the... the best way to approach the statute... and I think it... it can... it can shed light on... on your question... is that if we start with the premise that what removal is is the transfer of the alien from the Government of the United States to the government of the country of removal.
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.496,971.354,"So... so, as you read... as you read this statute, the United States can never send somebody back to a country that doesn't want them."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,971.93,981.468,"It would... in... in this removal process, it does require acceptance from the country of removal."
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.461,987.662,Why... why would... why would Congress ever want to impose that categorical requirement?
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,987.662,1000.665,--The... the reason why it... it would fit in with the... with the statute is that Congress has in this statute has expressed an interest in the orderly process of deportation.
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.394,1038.682,"Can the... can the alien challenge a decision by the Attorney General that, yes, a certain country has accepted him?"
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1038.682,1059.837,"The... I... I... if there is a... if there was a wholly unreasonable claim by the Government that there was acceptance, they... not--"
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.837,1062.171,So... so the alien can litigate that issue.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1062.171,1075.712,"--I think that the alien can if the... if the Government were to take a position... let's say in... in... in a... in... in this case the Government agrees, admits that there is no acceptance."
2004.03-674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.766,1103.016,It seems rather strange to me.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1111.394,1120.765,"Well, you... you should know that because that is the... the acceptance is the willing receipt of the... of the alien by the country of removal."
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1120.765,1121.963,--What happened in China?
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1141.904,1149.622,"The... the instances we know about come from the... from the Tom Man case, which was decided by the Second Circuit in 1958."
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.957,1233.048,"Now, are there instances where we have deported people to places that they said, no, we won't take him, and we have anyway?"
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1233.048,1237.772,"We don't... we don't know of any, and the... and the Government has... has not cited--"
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.772,1238.31,Okay. Then another--
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.31,1239.88,And you say there can't be any under this law.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1239.88,1241.161,--We say there can't be.
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.161,1264.361,"So that if some state opens its prisons and puts its criminals on a boat and sends them to the United States, as has happened in the past, your interpretation of this statute is that Congress has forbidden the President from shipping these criminals back where they came from, so long as the country that expelled them doesn't want these criminals back."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1264.899,1265.892,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.892,1267.007,--What... what are you saying?
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1267.007,1273.588,The reason for that is that this statute deals with the removal of aliens who have been through removal proceedings.
2004.03-674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.578,1292.231,Is the statute so limited?
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1292.231,1295.242,"It... it... yes, it does."
2004.03-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.839,1317.162,The United States has turned boats back.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1321.21,1321.703,Yes.
2004.03-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1321.703,1323.106,--before we entered World War II.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1323.106,1324.925,It... it has.
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1370.083,1376.688,--But what's bothering me partly in this case is it's being argued on the ground that this is like a country that says we don't want him.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1391.177,1391.716,--Yes.
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1391.716,1402.24,"And... and maybe this is all evidentiary when they changed the word... add the word government, that the word country throughout is simply assuming a place that has an organized government."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1405.583,1406.038,There is.
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1452.849,1453.22,All right.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1485.792,1486.701,"Well, I--"
2004.03-674,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.701,1490.25,"If you could affirm that that's so, then that would be very strong for you."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1491.326,1494.708,--I... I don't... I don't know if... if that is so.
2004.03-674,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1534.626,1541.852,"I thought the Government said you... you didn't raise this question below, that you didn't argue that Somalia wasn't a country."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1541.852,1545.772,"Your Honor, it... it... this is... this is not a new claim or a new issue."
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.202,1567.32,"Well, but that doesn't seem to be the question you actually presented in your petition for certiorari."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1567.32,1575.66,"Well, Your Honor, I would... I would quote the... the Government's phrasing of the question in... in--"
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.66,1590.066,"Well, but you're... you're bound by the question that you presented, and it is whether the Attorney General can remove an alien to one of the countries designated in the statute without obtaining that country's acceptance of the alien prior to removal."
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1593.493,1597.124,"--Your Honor, it... it doesn't specifically say--"
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.124,1599.354,It doesn't say specifically or generally.
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1599.354,1611.985,"--It... it... what I would say is that the... that if you go... if there is no government in that country, then there can be no acceptance."
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.937,1636.523,Was it addressed by the majority opinion?
2004.03-674,0,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,1636.523,1638.652,"--It was not addressed by the majority opinion, no, Your Honor."
2004.03-674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1644.613,1646.415,"Very well, Mr. Keyes."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1647.568,1653.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.745,1679.436,Why... why did you narrow the question presented in your brief if you're willing to take that... that much more categorical position and much more important position for the Government?
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1695.661,1696.116,I mean--
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1696.116,1698.156,--than... than the one presented by petitioner.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1698.156,1704.206,--We... we narrowed it in that way because we feel that that's the only question that is squarely before this Court.
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1704.744,1706.064,That's all you want us to decide?
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1706.064,1720.636,"--Well, we've also indicated that the... the logical thrust of most of our arguments is to the effect that an individual could be removed to an otherwise permissible country, notwithstanding the lack of acceptance of a functioning central government."
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.636,1733.889,"Well, I... I don't think it's the logical thrust necessarily, and if we... if we did it the way your question presented suggests, we're deciding this case only for people who are going to be deported to Somalia or... what other areas of the world have no functioning government?"
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1733.889,1735.497,"Somalia is the only one, and--"
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.497,1738.348,That's... I wouldn't have voted to take the case.
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.348,1738.585,So it's much narrower.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1738.585,1741.691,"--Well, obviously we... we opposed the certiorari petition."
2004.03-674,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1751.434,1758.088,"Yes, but it... it's very odd when the petitioner's question was broader and turned on whether there was acceptance or not."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1758.088,1780.058,"--Well, I think our... the reason... one of the reasons we framed the question as we did is that petitioner's last argument in the brief was, as we read it, to the effect that whatever the text of the statute might say, there has been an established understanding over the decades that removal is not permitted in the absence of acceptance by the receiving country's government."
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.992,1814.238,"As I... as I understand it, following up a bit on Justice Scalia, the question presented is whether he can remove an alien to one of the countries designated without obtaining that country's acceptance."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1814.759,1815.381,Without--
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1815.381,1818.724,"Now, one possible... prior... of the alien prior to removal."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1819.467,1820.786,--Although--
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1820.786,1822.189,--from their cert petition.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1822.189,1833.706,"--I do... I think you left out one word that is... is crucial, that is, his position necessarily turns on the proposition that we have to get acceptance not simply from the country, but from the government of that country."
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1833.706,1838.536,"But what the cert petition says, without obtaining that country's acceptance of the alien."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1862.479,1863.239,"I mean, we would submit--"
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1863.239,1873.792,"Now, that's... that's an answer no to the question presented for a very narrow reason that does not get us involved in anything other than Somalia."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1882.475,1887.371,"--Well, first, we would... we would submit that the question presented presupposes that Somalia is a country."
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1919.693,1923.758,So you're not saying you can dump people in Antarctica or possibly send them to the moon.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1923.758,1927.949,"--We're saying that... we're saying, first, that Antarctica and Somalia are countries."
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1928.609,1930.074,Antarctica is a country?
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1933.934,1943.759,--It's extremely unlikely that... that the... the text of a statute could ever be satisfied because the permitted removal countries are countries such as the country in which--
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.759,1944.215,If they were born there--
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1944.215,1945.291,--Exactly.
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.291,1946.943,"--raised by penguins, send them--"
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1947.686,1953.137,"So in any event, we... we think that Somalia is a country."
2004.03-674,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.788,1999.538,"Before you do so, could you tell me what was the outcome in that Southern District of Texas case which relied on this decision, the Eighth Circuit's decision here, to send someone to Ethiopia without consent?"
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1999.538,2001.934,I don't know what ultimately happened to the alien.
2004.03-674,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2018.159,2028.456,"Is... is there anything to it other than the practical objection that when you get the person there, the country won't accept him, so we sent him... be left with you--"
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2028.456,2028.933,--I think it--
2004.03-674,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2028.933,2029.638,--unless we dump him in the sea.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2029.638,2042.574,"--it's a measure of inconvenience if he's flown there and back, but we would say that even if the Court held that the statute requires acceptance by the receiving country's government, it would not be necessary for us to obtain a prior assurance of acceptance."
2004.03-674,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.679,2053.536,You don't fly him to the border.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2056.507,2057.168,--I'm... I'm sorry.
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.772,2077.496,--But that... they can win on that one because it doesn't say anything about prior in (vii).
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2077.496,2078.139,Right.
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.589,2109.818,Whether they are... whether they are a government or not.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2109.818,2115.019,"The... the barrier... the potential barrier is not that there won't be acceptance, that there... but that there won't be acceptance--"
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.019,2115.069,People with guns. Right.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2115.069,2120.436,--there won't be acceptance by people that we would regard as the government of Somalia.
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2206.014,2207.25,"Mr. Stewart, may I interrupt you?"
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2388.923,2404.321,"--Well, let me... let me turn the Court first to page 3 of the Government's brief that has the text of current subsection (D), and I think that maybe that will help me to explain it best because the way we would formulate our interpretation of subsection (D) is very slightly different from the way that... that you characterized it earlier."
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2467.729,2470.33,"So if... if there is acceptance, he does have to remove."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2472.559,2475.41,"--We... we would say he has discretion, but he... but he has--"
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.41,2476.274,That doesn't make... can I interrupt here?
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2505.614,2508.98,--I... I agree that that is generally the international practice.
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.542,2515.85,How... how could... say you send a person back to Great Britain and they say we're not going to take him.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2519.261,2521.777,"--I think as a practical matter in that context, it would be impossible."
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.635,2528.177,So the word shall cannot mean shall because he... he cannot in every case do it.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2528.177,2530.528,"--Well, it says he shall do it unless--"
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.528,2532.468,Unless there's acceptance.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2532.468,2532.634,--Right.
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2533.749,2542.665,"I guess you could say that he shall do everything he possibly can, but his mandate to do that evaporates if there's no acceptance."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2542.665,2543.137,That's correct.
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.137,2543.491,Wait a minute.
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.03,2545.682,Put the two questions--
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.682,2545.888,--We're going too far.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2560.393,2561.136,That... that's--
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.136,2566.875,"It has an inefficient ministry of state, and... and the guy arrives."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2576.634,2577.277,--That... that's correct.
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2577.277,2585.535,"--But now, putting those three questions together, it seemed to me what you're saying it is possible to read the statute the way you're saying."
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.777,2641.346,I think the House wrote that in the report.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2643.036,2643.862,I don't remember.
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.862,2644.771,Did the President know about--
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2644.771,2645.409,It... it was the House report.
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2645.409,2653.127,Some people actually read those reports and feel they are a clue to what Congress is trying to get at.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2668.92,2669.308,"Well, first--"
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2669.308,2670.118,So I'm interested--
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2670.118,2680.809,"--Well, first, there were only two court of appeals decisions that we've been pointed to in which the attempt remove an alien was actually thwarted on the basis that there had been a no acceptance by the receiving country's government."
2004.03-674,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2690.719,2693.524,--That is an amazing non sequitur.
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.524,2693.978,--Good point.
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2694.804,2697.859,"If you believe that, Mr. Stewart--"
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2697.859,2698.935,--And I think... and I think... but--
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2698.935,2701.99,"You... you mean if he had been on this Court, he would have been infallible."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2702.279,2704.137,"--Exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly."
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2714.994,2715.366,--Okay.
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.852,2718.255,Let me just... let me get an answer to my question.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2734.025,2734.125,--No.
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.957,2774.526,"Well, then it's an exception to subparagraph (iv)."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2774.526,2777.293,--It's an exception to subparagraph (iv)... to subparagraph--
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.293,2782.328,So you are reading the language in subparagraph (vii) as a... an exception to subparagraph (iv).
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2782.328,2782.783,--No.
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.151,2788.727,I'm at (E).
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2788.727,2788.977,Okay.
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.977,2799.667,"And I'm saying if you read (E) your way, subsection (iv) is a mandatory command to the Attorney General that he may not be able to carry out unless he can comply with subsection (vii)."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2799.667,2807.303,We're not saying that subsection (E)(iv) is a mandate that the Attorney General or the Secretary must remove to--
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.303,2808.501,It says shall remove.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2808.501,2813.99,"--It says shall remove to one of the following countries, but it clearly is not intended to be a mandate because the introductory--"
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.99,2814.695,He can choose one of them.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2814.695,2824.976,"--the introductory... he doesn't have to choose one because the introductory language of Roman (vii) says, if impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to remove the alien, dot, dot, dot."
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.976,2825.431,Right.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2825.431,2836.122,"So it specifically contemplates the possibility that situations may arise in which it will not be practicable, possible, or advisable to remove the alien to any of the foregoing countries."
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.744,2840.952,And wouldn't it always be impossible if... if the... if the other country will not accept the alien?
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2840.952,2845.493,"--I think... I mean, to... to give a slight variance on the hypothetical that Justice Scalia posed, if a future--"
2004.03-674,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.493,2847.279,I'd rather have an answer to my question.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2847.279,2848.344,--I think it would not always be impossible.
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2907.991,2914.9,"--May... may I go back to, let's say, the... the nub, the narrow nub of... of my earlier question, and that is this."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2979.035,2980.15,--I guess we'd have two responses.
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3016.846,3022.313,"So you're saying that the predecessor language can be read the same way, you say, (D) can be read now."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3022.313,3022.519,That's correct.
2004.03-674,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3022.519,3023.057,Okay.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3023.057,3023.966,I guess the other point we would make is--
2004.03-674,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3023.966,3044.317,"Then you... you think Judge Reavley, who was sitting on the Ninth Circuit at the time and dissented in the Ali Ali case, that he was dead wrong when he said the prior statute did condition willing acceptance for all countries to which aliens could be deported."
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3044.317,3044.855,--Yes.
2004.03-674,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3046.236,3050.944,He thinks... his dissent turns on a difference between the current statute and the prior statute.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3050.944,3051.116,Yes.
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3090.325,3090.984,I haven't followed you.
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3093.585,3115.338,"--Well, I think petitioner's reliance on subsection (D) is to the effect that however you would otherwise read subsection (E), subsection (D) deals specifically with removal to the country of nationality or citizenship, and if you don't meet the prerequisites for removal to that country under (D), then you can't do an end run by resorting to (E)."
2004.03-674,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.907,3137.358,That's... that's not one of the choices under (E).
2004.03-674,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3141.51,3160.003,"They... they don't include that, but as a practical matter, I think the state of nationality is... is always or virtually always going to be covered because they include country of birth, country from which the alien departed to enter the United States, country in which he previously resided, country of... that's under the sovereignty of... that exercises sovereignty over the country in which he was born."
2004.03-674,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3295.048,3296.822,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2004.03-674,2,31353,jeffrey_j_keyes,,3299.051,3323.079,"I would like to respond by pointing out that on the... on the point that Justice Souter raised with respect to the language of the statute prior to 1996, my... my brother counsel did not quote the most important part of the statute that was in effect at that time."
2004.03-674,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3450.016,3451.047,"Thank you, Mr. Keyes."
