1970.78,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.097,"We'll hear arguments in number 78, Atlantic City Electric Co against the United States and others and Alabama Power Company and others against the United States number 106."
1970.78,0,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,55.895,61.503,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.78,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,740.105,741.039,Could I ask you a question?
1970.78,0,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,741.039,742.929,Surely Your Honor.
1970.78,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,742.929,750.861,"Is this revenue proceeding, this general revenue proceeding creature of the statute or the creature of commission?"
1970.78,0,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,750.861,754.505,It is a creature of the commission.
1970.78,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,788.907,805.111,"Why is it that is being administrative creature, it's not very significant as to whether or not the statute has a review per se."
1970.78,0,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,805.111,813.543,"Well Your Honor, this is a proceeding which follows the Interstate Commerce Act."
1970.78,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,840.519,845.04,Do you have specific review provisions in those sections?
1970.78,0,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,845.04,864.003,There is a specific review provision Section 1336 of Title 28 which says that all others in the Interstate Commerce Commission are subject to review in the Courts.
1970.78,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1223.41,1229.861,"Well, are you suggesting Mr. McCarthy that you don't prevail here, you have no evidence of review?"
1970.78,0,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,1229.861,1232.612,I am stating exactly that Your Honor.
1970.78,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1340.113,1340.958,Mr. O'Malley.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,1340.958,1344.967,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.78,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1372.783,1377.597,I apologize for interrupting you right at the threshold of your argument.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,1384.358,1384.975,Yes Your Honor.
1970.78,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1384.975,1401.186,"And this suggests that if your view is correct, then every single District Court in the nation could be asked by a shipper to review this commission determination."
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,1403.282,1409.344,I would say that every District Court of the nation could do.
1970.78,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1409.344,1411.166,In every Federal District in the country.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,1411.166,1444.06,"However, as I believe we suggested in our briefs, reply briefs and the Government has in it, there are various judicial remedies needless to mention to this Court of transfer of venue and stays to decide no other cases and there's always the possibility conceivably of a special master being appointed collectively it seems to us by a group of District Courts, if there are a multiplicity of this type of suit."
1970.78,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1456.632,1474.0,"Well, I didn't -- I say apologize again for interrupting you right at the beginning but that is one of the matters frankly that I had questions about, that is this about how many District Courts there are, 86, a 100 and whatever it is and also as I understand it, there's no statute of limitations."
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,1474.0,1476.19,This is true.
1970.78,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1476.19,1480.358,I would hope that in due course in your arguments you would.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,1480.358,1488.076,"We do believe, however since this is – as you say it that the threshold, it's a terribly important point."
1970.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2078.944,2083.117,May I ask you when these proceedings started first.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2083.117,2091.163,"Mr. Justice Black this -- the hearings of the Interstate Commerce Commission were in 1968, commenced in 1968."
1970.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2091.163,2093.034,Is that when it was filed?
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2093.034,2112.598,"It was filed in 1968 Your Honor and in March of 1968 and the first of the two final orders, if we made the total final order was issued in November of ‘68 and the second in January of '69, the final order of two parts."
1970.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2112.598,2117.225,Do all parties agree that it is a final order?
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2117.225,2140.779,"No Your Honor, I believe that the railroads take the position that it is not a final order and seek affirmance of the court below to that effect and the Government, the commission and Department of Justice of United States take the position that part of the order is not final."
1970.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2145.094,2149.679,All evidence final and you would do to get a court judiciary hearing on the whole order?
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2149.679,2154.685,Yes Mr. Justice Black.
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.685,2165.666,"Now, what if the railroads dismissed this whole proceeding and just filed a specific rate with respect to the commodities your clients are interested in?"
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2165.666,2173.725,"Well Your Honor, I think that --"
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.725,2177.157,"What would you do then, you would have to challenge the rate wouldn't you?"
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2177.157,2178.243,We would have to challenge the rate just because --
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.243,2181.916,What would be the issues in that proceeding?
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2181.916,2184.876,I am not completely clear from your question Mr. Justice White.
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.876,2194.632,Suppose let's assume this whole proceeding had never started and the railroad simply come forward and filed a new specific rates on specific commodities that your clients are interested in.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2194.632,2198.028,And the commission had let it go into effect.
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.152,2207.384,And what would be the issues in that proceeding?
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2207.384,2221.29,"The issues in that proceeding would be those specified in the statute whether the particular rate over that particular route with that particular traffic is unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory, preferential."
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.29,2229.131,And doesn't the statute tell the commission some factors to take into account in deciding those issues?
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2229.131,2244.902,Although it's not very specific beyond that Your Honor but beyond the provision except that it does require.
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.058,2256.434,How about the revenue needs of the railroad?
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2256.434,2265.138,"No, I don't believe, well yes under section 1582 for that particular traffic, I believe that -- that I would have to answer yes."
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.065,2284.642,"Why should you get any broader review in this proceeding than you would in a 152, if the railroad had just started out filing specific rates rather than the general rate, what's that?"
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2284.642,2287.009,"Thank you, I'm not, I will continue --"
1970.78,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.009,2290.195,We will continue after lunch counsel.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2295.5,2296.667,May it please the Court.
1970.78,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2296.667,2297.611,Proceed.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2297.611,2308.331,"If I may, I'd like to return to Mr. Justice White's question just before the recess which I don't believe I have explored sufficiently for his purposes."
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.823,2372.629,"What would be the issues, if they had filed specific tariffs and neither one of the alternative things would have happened."
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2374.49,2376.608,The issues would have been --
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.608,2378.614,Just as unreasonable for the rates.
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2378.614,2414.271,"That's right, that just as unreasonable for the rate and the factors that would have been opened would have been to the extent of those particular rates a diversionary effect of the increases on those particular traffics, which would not have taken into account the total diversionary effects that we feel have been decided in this case on a nationwide basis and to the extent it was possible in this miniscule section of the total revenue picture of the railroads."
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.284,2465.962,Are your files clear and the rates are there exactly?
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2465.962,2484.872,"Well, the interest in our clients are really in getting a judicial review of the acts of the commission in making determination that results in an increase across the board on the rates of our traffic and if that is properly -- sorry sir."
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.872,2487.332,(Inaudible)
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2487.332,2491.322,We are interested in our own traffic ultimately yes Your Honor but we are interested --
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.322,2495.711,(Inaudible)
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2495.711,2514.315,"No Your Honor, we are interested in litigating the entire in having a review of the entire proceeding which happened to impinge on us to the extent of many millions of dollars by virtue of an overall decision which we claim is unsoundly based in fact and law."
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.315,2524.179,(Inaudible)
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2524.179,2531.335,We want to argue that it's unsound with respect to our traffic of course but we want to also argue that -- and our traffics --
1970.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.335,2538.432,(Inaudible).
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2538.432,2559.115,"If Your Honor please I believe the kind of proceeding that would take place were just sent back for review by the three-judge court would review the issues in the big proceeding that impinged on the traffics, we were concerned with and would order if any refunds or the refunds related to our traffics."
1970.78,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2572.484,2580.183,"But then it isn't the broad attack that we had discussed this morning, really is it?"
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2580.183,2622.475,"Yes Your Honor because Mr. Chief Justice the only reason these rates have been raised and the reason we ask a review of this investigation of the commission which determined these rates could be raised by this much was on the basis of a record which we claim as deficient, improperly assembled and evidence insubstantially founded and that there were proper considerations as the statute requires under Section 1582 of diversion where a final finding suit have been made as to diversion and were as we contend and we feel that we have been misdealt with our clients have been misdealt with by the commission in the way it conducted its proceeding."
1970.78,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2622.475,2638.047,"Well, if you can do so, could you give me any idea of what percentage of the total order would be reviewed under this attack?It is either tons of dollars or --"
1970.78,1,32268,james_o’malley,,2638.047,2664.445,I think that would be difficult to do except to say that our clients perhaps are involved in something of the order of five million dollars a year of rate increases in a very broad sense against maybe 400 million dollars worth of rate increases on the total authorized by the commission but this is a very difficult figure to arrive at with any precision Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.78,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2688.475,2691.727,Mr. Springer you may proceed whenever you're ready.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,2691.727,2694.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2799.085,2801.208,What is your position?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,2801.208,2812.262,As to that I'm just going to say Mr. Justice Black the -- my three clients are substantially in agreement on that which is why I think I can appropriately speak for all of them.
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.222,3173.545,(Inaudible)
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3173.545,3175.013,That's true Mr. Justice White.
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3194.691,3212.924,I take it (Inaudible) whether the issues that the commission does determine in this general proceeding are foreclosed from free examination and subsequent specific rate proceeding.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3212.924,3219.83,"Yes, well in a nutshell, I don't think any of them are necessarily legally foreclosed."
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.997,3238.115,You mean that if shippers fails to act the particular determinations of this general revenue proceeding now by seeking review.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3246.467,3261.169,"Not as a matter of strict law, practically speaking though as to the general revenue needs question that is a question which we agree with the Alabama Power plaintiffs has been thoroughly considered and thoroughly decided by the commission."
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.169,3270.489,The commission probably would take this first and you would have the record but the same issues could be reviewed formerly.
1970.78,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3270.489,3273.495,There is no res judicata aspect to it?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3273.495,3276.157,"No, it is a matter, I suppose of stare decisis as to --"
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3276.157,3282.452,Do you get the same -- later in Court on the same record as you you can get the thing that you are claiming --
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3282.452,3296.231,"Yes but in the pragmatic terms in which we're talking, that subsequent Court review of this question would be in no way, no realistic way aided by the fact that there had been an additional agency proceeding in the interim as to the general revenue needs question."
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.231,3299.174,How was the matter to this specific that's true?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3299.174,3300.417,"Yes, and now as to other issues --"
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.417,3301.429,As to other issues?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3301.429,3301.961,Yes.
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.961,3306.206,And the Court will look at them all at once.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3306.206,3307.453,As to that rate except to that --
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.453,3310.31,The cost of the general determination.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3310.31,3311.511,Yes.
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.349,3353.094,"How long is it after commission makes the determinations like this well, immediately at that specific rates taken in to account --"
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3353.094,3359.503,"Yes, and frankly the time table of this proceeding was dictated by the fact that the commission suspended the rates."
1970.78,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.095,3379.164,At that point the shipper gets a specific rate would you say?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3379.164,3390.457,"Yes, by instituting a new proceeding which of course would take some time and it might be a year or two later by the time judicial review could be had as to that."
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3390.457,3416.907,"The commission itself as I understand it in the Koppers Company case 303 Interstate Commerce Commission has taken the position that in a later proceeding attacking a specific rate, the general authorization or a rate increase is just not at all relevant, am I mistaken about that?"
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3416.907,3418.62,That's what the language in that opinion.
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3427.8,3429.574,But it simply declined to consider it.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3429.574,3429.957,Yes.
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3429.957,3430.877,Didn't they?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3430.877,3431.751,And as to the general revenue.
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3431.751,3436.973,To oppose or to admit any evidence or argument about it and --
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3436.973,3445.961,"Yes and as to the general revenue findings, the only thing it could do in such a further proceeding would be a kind of reconsideration of what it had already decided for."
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3445.961,3452.718,"Now, if the commission declined to give you that much to reconsider even perform reconsideration, am I mistaken?"
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3452.718,3468.936,"Yes, it's true in that case though again it's -- I think I do have honestly I have to say that that does not reflect a fully fleshed out and thought out commission consideration of exactly the kind of problem that we have here."
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3802.855,3807.099,Does that put you in sympathy with Judge Wright's dissent?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3807.099,3814.111,"Yes, completely in sympathy in the Alabama Power case which was the case he was focusing on."
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3814.111,3817.078,But he also referred to the other case.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3818.272,3823.479,Yes he did.
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3891.994,3895.076,Why do you say it should be stayed?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3895.076,3908.063,"Just in the interest of orderly judicial review, this would frankly be a judicial construct quite analogous to what the Hobbs Act provides with respect to those administrative agencies."
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3908.063,3910.686,So that you would be tried with two issues in two Courts?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3910.686,3917.656,At the same time when they're overlapping and when one proceeding might well resolve all of the issues in the other --
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3917.656,3921.167,"It could well be many more than just two Courts, couldn't it?"
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3923.842,3927.4,"Yes, it certainly could."
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3927.4,3928.008,Very easily.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3929.173,3932.502,"Yes, but I think as the Court pointed out in the --"
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3932.502,3937.937,It's not a hypothesis at all because they're obviously shippers in every Federal District are there not?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3937.937,3945.668,"Yes, yes, it certainly are Mr. Justice but as the Court pointed out in Abbot Laboratories, there are remedies for this kind of problem."
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3977.55,3988.058,Let us say a single three-judge court disposed of it must prevent another shipper thereafter bring a brand new proceeding in another three-judge court in some other district.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,3991.819,3996.659,"Yes, as I think as Mr. O'Malley suggested, there is the aspect of latches and I think --"
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3996.659,4000.462,"And along with there will be Equal Protection, isn't it?"
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,4000.462,4005.184,Well the other protection is the judgment of that three-judge court that it should not --
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4005.184,4006.948,Of confidential value?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,4006.948,4007.602,Yes and the Court --
1970.78,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4007.602,4008.507,It is not res judicata?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,4008.507,4014.009,Yes and these are equitable proceedings of course and the Court is expected to exercise its deal of equitable expression.
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4014.009,4017.431,Are the increased rates now in effect?
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,4017.431,4029.087,Yes Mr. Justice and in fact there had been three subsequent increases which are in effect in whole or in part since the 1968 proposal.
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4029.087,4033.116,"What is your proposal -- there should be done about that, any thing?"
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,4033.116,4034.631,About the additional increases?
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4034.631,4038.495,The increased rates.
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,4038.495,4039.363,Well those rates of course --
1970.78,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4039.363,4044.271,"Are you going to take care of that one way or the other, would you suggest?"
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,4044.271,4049.568,"No, we have not suggested any effort to undo those increases."
1970.78,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4079.029,4086.366,"Mr. Springer, you're familiar with the existence of the Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States on multi district litigation."
1970.78,2,40859,springer,,4098.032,4102.212,I think so Mr. Chief Justice though as I am not fully familiar with this.
1970.78,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4126.381,4128.68,"Very well, thank you Mr. Springer."
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4135.365,4139.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4925.143,4925.92,Mr. Cox.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4925.92,4928.202,Yes?
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4928.202,4941.193,As I understood you told us that this body of authority with respect to the non-reviewability of refusal to suspend is based upon two foundations?
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4941.193,4942.167,"I think yes, I think --"
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4942.167,4943.695,One 157?
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4943.695,4945.149,One is the idea that the --
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4945.149,4946.075,And what is the other idea?
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4946.075,4956.71,The other idea is that the shipper has inadequate remedy under the complaint proceeding to which he should resort before seeking judicial review.
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4959.521,4963.981,And it's a slap over under non finality I suppose or some sort of that.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4963.981,4970.443,"Yes, I have difficulty I must confess to the Court with a concept of finality."
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4983.348,4984.715,Or prematurity --
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4984.715,4985.039,Yes.
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4985.093,4986.173,Some lack of maturity.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,4986.173,4987.39,That's right.
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5003.735,5009.912,"Now that I have interrupted you, I think you told us that this --the general revenue orders go back 50 years or so?"
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5009.912,5014.356,Oh yes.
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5068.084,5075.438,"Because it's really a procedure not -- certainly not explicitly contemplated by the legislation, is it?"
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5075.438,5080.944,"That's right, this is an administrative mechanism which the commission --"
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5080.944,5082.93,Based upon necessity I suppose.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5082.93,5084.955,Yes sir.
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5393.555,5394.554,You're telling about the Koppers case?
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5394.554,5397.147,"Koppers case, yes, I think that's what it means."
1970.78,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5624.148,5635.787,"I suppose these shippers could win this case here, it these rates set aside and then turn right around and then lose a case in which the railroads filed specific rates on their commodity."
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5635.787,5639.785,"That's right, same rates or possibly higher rates."
1970.78,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5689.843,5696.495,Well Mr. Cox isn't it -- doesn't it really sound as though the just and reasonableness language is just inappropriate for those.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5696.495,5697.849,It is inappropriate and --
1970.78,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5697.849,5702.421,I mean this -- they're really saying that probable cause to increase these rates.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5703.944,5714.34,"That's right or you could say this, say we had a look at them and doesn't appear to us as any reason why we should suspend them for the full statutory period."
1970.78,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5716.807,5719.945,It's as though the commission hasn't said anything.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5719.945,5725.509,The odd thing is Mr. Justice White that in an ordinary suspension case --
1970.78,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5725.509,5726.319,They don't say that.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5726.319,5726.991,They do say that.
1970.78,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5730.295,5731.359,In a specific rate case?
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5731.359,5735.679,In a specific rate cases although if there's anything it's well settled.
1970.78,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5749.747,5752.128,Well it doesn't bar anything in a subsequent proceeding.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5752.128,5753.393,"No, no."
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5766.561,5771.754,"But those, generally they didn't say anything in the suspending or refusing to suspend."
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,5771.754,5781.225,"Well, they can do that, they don't have to say anything and they can do that and as a matter of fact in one of the success, the rate increases that followed this one."
1970.78,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6099.402,6100.097,Mr. Cox.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,6100.097,6100.217,Yes.
1970.78,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6100.217,6101.426,Give me a minute.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,6109.558,6124.435,Mr. Justice Marshall I think that these refunds I am speaking of are refunds that the commission attaches as condition to its refusal to suspend the rates.
1970.78,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6124.435,6126.676,Thank you.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,6126.676,6134.808,"And when the railroads take advantage of that refusal of course, they have to accept the conditions."
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6753.931,6761.956,Mr. Cox can you say off hand how many general revenue orders have there been since 1920 or whatever the beginning date was?
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,6761.956,6777.048,There have been I think around 15 Mr. Justice Harlan of course some of those orders have involved more than one report and are reported in more than one place because some of them went on for a time.
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6784.856,6793.684,Do they always involve all the railroads or just -- or sometimes just a group of railroads or railroads of certain region?
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,6793.684,6803.601,"In the cases since 1920 Mr. Justice Stewart, my present recollection is maybe a little blurred that I think they have usually involved all the railroads."
1970.78,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6833.591,6839.282,"When you said in response the last 20 years, did you misspeak yourself or did you mean 1920?"
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,6839.282,6860.512,"Well I will tell you what I meant was precisely that Mr. Chief Justice, I have somewhat clear recollection of the cases since about 1950 than I have with the cases before that and I -- there may have been some cases that before that where perhaps not all the railroads were involved."
1970.78,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6865.949,6872.665,Where is the Aberdeen and Rockfish railroads?
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,6872.665,6879.698,I thought I prepared thoroughly but I --
1970.78,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6879.698,6881.393,It's not one of the large carriers.
1970.78,3,26750,hugh_b_cox,,6881.393,6884.644,It's not one of large.
1970.78,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6885.529,6887.365,Thank you Mr. Cox.
1970.78,4,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,6892.064,6902.93,"If the Court please, this effort to equate suspension with the order in this case is pretty far fetched."
1970.78,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7026.678,7028.549,Is that critical to your argument?
1970.78,4,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,7028.549,7029.592,Yes it is Your Honor.
1970.78,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7029.592,7031.266,Will you lose the case if you are wrong?
1970.78,4,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,7031.266,7041.36,"No Your Honor, because we have here an order modifying outstanding orders."
1970.78,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7052.147,7053.71,Well is it critical?
1970.78,4,19667,charles_j_mccarthy,,7053.71,7056.812,Well it's -- except for that point there.
1970.78,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7080.492,7081.683,Thank you Mr. McCarthy.
