1986.85-767,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.558,"We will hear argument first this afternoon in No. 85-767, North Carolina Department of Transportation versus Crest Street Community Council."
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,16.676,20.878,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the honorable Court:"
1986.85-767,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.411,308.399,"This was the United States Department of Transportation you referred to, General Thornburg?"
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,308.399,308.682,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,401.158,410.764,"General Thornburg, when you say that had been resolved, is it more or less conceded that the bulk of the relief requested had been obtained?"
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,410.764,433.146,"--I would say that the bulk of the relief requested was obtained in the sense that what they sought, if your Honor please, it dealt with primarily... their complaint dealt with the relocation of parties that lived in the Crest Street community that were being moved as a result of the building of the road."
1986.85-767,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,475.557,478.674,Who... what court issued that injunction?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,478.674,482.96,"--That was the Middle District Court, Federal Middle District Court for North Carolina, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,482.96,485.078,That was back in '75?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,485.078,486.062,'73.
1986.85-767,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,486.062,486.912,'73.
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,486.912,487.697,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,487.697,489.414,So it's been outstanding for ten years.
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,489.414,490.649,Exactly.
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.184,579.005,"I suppose... did they want to, without having intervened?"
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,582.373,584.992,--We really had no serious objection.
1986.85-767,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,845.625,850.562,"The provision for informal disputes, where is that to be found?"
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,851.962,855.847,--Informal dispute resolution?
1986.85-767,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,855.847,856.064,--Yes.
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,856.064,859.585,That's in 2149c.
1986.85-767,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,859.585,860.901,What statute is that?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,860.901,868.524,"21... it's the Code of Federal Regulations, 49 CFR 21.1 et seq."
1986.85-767,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,871.226,875.445,And that... expressly refers to the Department of Transportation?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,875.445,875.945,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,877.213,878.83,Is it limited to that department?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,878.83,879.397,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.527,1004.645,"Well, could I just ask you--"
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1004.645,1005.362,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.362,1011.733,"--do the regulations, or something, anticipate the filing of complaints?"
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1011.733,1013.168,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.168,1013.951,Administrative complaints.
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1013.951,1015.085,I'm sorry?
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.085,1018.739,The filing of complaints with the administration?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1018.739,1019.572,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.226,1029.178,So they were following the administrative procedure?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1029.178,1029.778,"--Oh, yes."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.778,1032.296,And you think this was a proceeding?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1032.296,1041.233,"I think it was a process, a voluntary dispute process, that does not raise to the level of a proceeding that's required by 1988, if Your Honor please."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.233,1042.384,"Well, it isn't required, but it's permitted."
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1042.384,1044.853,This form--
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.853,1046.236,Do you think this is a proceeding?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1048.471,1049.005,"--Oh, no."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.005,1051.673,"But it's a proceeding, nevertheless, isn't it?"
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1051.673,1054.292,"It is a procedure, or proceeding."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.85,1067.719,"Well, they filed a complaint and participated."
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1067.719,1076.908,They filed a complaint simply calling to the attention of the U.S. Department of Transportation the fact that this potential violation--
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.908,1078.675,"Well, they told the Department what they objected to."
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1078.675,1079.61,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.61,1081.76,And the Department addressed those complaints.
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1081.76,1087.096,"The Department, as required by these same regulations, then said: We'll have an investigation."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.58,1123.686,You're not suggesting that Crest Street and the state highway department were not antagonists in these discussions?
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1123.686,1128.523,"You know, I don't think that you would say that any of these folks were antagonists."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.815,1141.115,"Right, right."
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1141.115,1143.017,Because they couldn't have done it in a court proceeding.
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.017,1143.7,"Well, I know."
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1147.552,1148.854,"Oh, difference of opinion, sure."
1986.85-767,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.637,1150.771,Voluntary dispute.
1986.85-767,0,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,1153.705,1154.324,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-767,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1156.04,1157.359,"Thank you, Mr. Thornburg."
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1159.092,1175.488,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-767,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1412.808,1429.354,"Mr. Lazarus, if the parties had not reached total agreement, and litigation had been proceeded with the counsel, would attorneys' fees be available for any portion of the work done in the administrative proceeding under Webb?"
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1429.354,1429.62,They might be.
1986.85-767,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1442.594,1444.963,Under the holding in Webb; that kind of approach?
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1444.963,1445.129,Precisely.
1986.85-767,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1448.781,1461.991,"Do you think that your approach is likely to cause people to file more lawsuits, then, to make sure that they have that as a means of getting attorneys' fees, rather than settling these things informally?"
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1461.991,1463.075,--We don't think so.
1986.85-767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1521.279,1529.719,"I don't understand how you encourage people to use the administrative process, and then deny them money."
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1529.719,1537.456,"Well, encourage... to use the administrative process... provided them with relief."
1986.85-767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1539.991,1541.157,I'm talking about their attorneys' fees.
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1541.157,1560.301,"Attorneys' fees are only necessary... entitled in the Congressional scheme... Congress could have passed a statute, Section 1988, a rule which said that whenever you do anything which modifies the behavior of another in a manner which furthers the policies of Title VI, you're entitled to fees; but they drew a line."
1986.85-767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1560.301,1562.717,I can think of three or four other hundred things that could have.
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1564.086,1570.24,"And here it drew a line, and it required that there be an action or proceeding to which the person complaining of discrimination--"
1986.85-767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1570.24,1570.94,"Well, isn't it a proceeding?"
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1570.94,1572.359,"--No, we believe it is not a proceeding."
1986.85-767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1572.359,1573.075,"Well, what is it?"
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1573.075,1576.561,"Here, it was merely an informal process within the agency."
1986.85-767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1576.561,1579.096,Informal process is not a proceeding?
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1579.096,1581.464,It's not a proceeding to which they were a party.
1986.85-767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1581.464,1584.13,"It didn't say, a proceeding to which they were a party."
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1586.049,1588.465,Section 1988 says that there has to be--
1986.85-767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1588.465,1592.619,"In order for you to prevail, don't we have to find that this was not a proceeding/+/."
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1592.619,1603.075,"--No, in order for us to prevail, you have to find that they were not... it was not a proceeding to enforce Title VI with which... in which they were a party that prevailed."
1986.85-767,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.162,1612.347,I think you can go until the red light.
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1613.632,1615.651,Reserving time for Mr. Thornburg's remarks.
1986.85-767,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.651,1617.234,"Okay, thank you, Mr. Lazarus."
1986.85-767,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1617.234,1617.617,--May I ask one question?
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1617.617,1618.603,Yes.
1986.85-767,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1618.603,1621.036,How do you define a proceeding?
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1621.036,1631.077,"A proceeding, in our view, within 1988, would require more indicia of formality, such as an adjudicatory proceeding."
1986.85-767,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1650.472,1656.442,"Well, wholly apart from not being a party, I'm curious on how you define a proceeding to exclude what happened here."
1986.85-767,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1656.442,1660.763,--It requires more indicia of formality.
1986.85-767,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.878,1687.413,"Thank you, Mr. Thornburg."
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,1689.449,1695.001,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-767,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.776,1743.434,"Mr. Calhoun, while we're on the text of the act, it doesn't say that you're entitled to fees with respect to any action or proceeding."
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,1813.43,1817.965,"First of all, I want to make sure I understand the question."
1986.85-767,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.356,1833.975,"No, that's not the argument I'm suggesting."
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,1861.458,1875.016,"This same issue came up in the case of New York Gaslight Company v. Carey, where the issue was, can you get fees in an independent action to recover fees?"
1986.85-767,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.677,1916.56,Why is that so anamolous?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,1944.529,1948.398,"In this case, the threshold of formality was reached."
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.937,2015.007,"May I ask you, Mr. Calhoun: The complain you refer to was filed before the Federal Department of Transportation; is that correct?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2015.007,2015.207,That's correct.
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.207,2019.959,Did the Federal Department of Transportation ever enter any formal orders in that proceeding?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2019.959,2030.266,"They issued a preliminary finding stating that... in effect, they issued a probable cause determination equivalent to that of--"
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2030.266,2034.468,And asked the parties to talk to one another about a settlement.
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2036.77,2041.491,--They urged the parties to conciliate and that the parties did--
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.491,2041.774,I know they urged them.
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2049.062,2062.905,"--No, the proceeding was determined... was terminated by the complaints withdrawing their complaint, which was explicitly the quid pro quo in the final settlement document."
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.274,2073.527,"Well, was there a final settlement document before the DOT... which was approved by the DOT?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2073.527,2083.568,The DOT accepted the withdrawal of the complaint after the plaintiffs and defendants entered into a formal settlement document.
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.303,2115.206,What you're saying is that the settlement agreement was not approved by the DOT; is that right?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2115.206,2123.293,"--It was, and that they then accepted withdrawal of the complaint and termination of the proceeding upon execution of the settlement agreement."
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.453,2138.905,Who were the parties to the settlement agreement?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2138.905,2148.178,"The parties... there were three parties... there were three entities that signed the settlement agreement: the plaintiffs, the defendants, and the City of Durham."
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.178,2152.046,And was that then submitted to the DOT for its approval?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2152.046,2157.616,"It was submitted to DOT saying, we have reached this agreement and therefore we are withdrawing our complaint, and there was--"
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.616,2159.333,And what was DOT's response?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2159.333,2161.235,"--There was no objection, and the complaint was--"
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2161.235,2164.287,But there was no approval or ratification either?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2164.287,2167.405,--That's... no explicit approval in terms of--
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.405,2168.989,"Well, was there implicit approval?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2168.989,2170.357,--Yes.
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.893,2178.761,"Well, is this something that's quite difficult to get the DOT to do, to allow a complaint to be withdrawn."
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2178.761,2182.349,I don't have experience in other cases to know.
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.297,2212.268,Except under... you would have had to go to the state agency.
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2212.268,2217.136,"North Carolina is a nondeferral state, so there is approved state agency."
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.839,2252.559,"Isn't it true, Mr. Calhoun, under Title VII, whether a deferral or nondeferral state, you must go to the agency before you can go to court?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2252.559,2254.595,"Yes, and--"
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.595,2263.201,"And wasn't that part of the reasoning of our opinion in New York Gaslight, was that the mandatory nature of the administrative proceeding is a prerequisite to court action?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2263.201,2267.705,"--It was part of the reasoning in Carey, but it was a different issue in Carey."
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2320.67,2322.186,"In your view, there's no question."
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2323.872,2327.074,"--They would say, quote, it's not a proceeding."
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.388,2403.824,"Mr. Calhoun, could I ask you a question?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2430.272,2433.224,There has to be a threshold requirement of a proceeding.
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.926,2435.692,And it's the filing of the complaint?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2435.692,2436.711,--It's the filing of a complaint.
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.519,2453.971,But did it trigger proceedings before the Department of Transportation?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2453.971,2454.59,Yes.
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.323,2484.792,Finding of a Title VI violation?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2484.792,2486.375,--A preliminary finding of... they--
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.375,2487.81,"A probable cause finding, wasn't it?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2487.81,2505.771,"--The wording used in the letter sent certified mail, return receipt requested, to the secretary of the state Department of Transportation was that they made a preliminary finding that a violation of Title VI would occur if the road was built in this manner."
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.067,2624.683,"Would it make some sense to say that if the agency gives you the relief that you want, you don't get fees; if they deny it, and you later get it in court, in addition to paying court costs, as part of the costs, which is the way the statute reads, as part of the costs in that proceeding, you will also get your administrative costs?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2640.325,2646.881,"This Court considered that exact same argument in Carey, and rejected it under Title VII--"
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.881,2649.666,"No, Carey involved the same proceeding."
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2665.426,2678.25,"--In Carey, I would not that this case is in virtually the same position procedurally as Carey, and as a case cited in the legislative history in the House report."
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.506,2724.731,"The federal court action was dismissed, because the defendant had agreed to abide by the state ruling; isn't that true?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2726.416,2727.733,"--In Gaslight, that's correct."
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.733,2733.82,And then... but the suit nevertheless was allowed to continue for the purposes of attorney's fees?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2733.82,2734.537,That's correct.
1986.85-767,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2859.003,2862.971,"Well, now, the motion to intervene was denied, though, wasn't it?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2862.971,2866.073,The motion to intervene was not explicitly ruled on.
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2879.047,2881.999,"But it referred to you, I thought, as an applicant for intervention?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2881.999,2887.653,"I think that may be the label on our signature, but it... the substance of that--"
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.653,2889.288,The substance of what?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2889.288,2895.009,"--Of the order, of the consent judgment, explicitly dismisses claims with prejudice."
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.499,2960.951,"Were you entitled to do that, by the way?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2960.951,2962.736,I think at the time--
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2962.736,2965.272,Could you have filed a Title VI suit?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2965.272,2973.942,"--At the time that we filed the administrative complaint, we believed that there was a substantial chance that it would be found that you had to exhaust that remedy."
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.554,2995.557,Under Title VI there is a private right of action that you can bring; is that right?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,2995.557,3000.695,"This Court, as you know well, has considerably varying opinions on that issue."
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.849,3017.788,"Which now could have been filed, at least under present law, you think, could have been filed immediately without filing any complaint before the agency?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3017.788,3022.709,"It now appears that way, although it appeared differently at the time we filed the administrative complaint."
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.477,3033.416,"And I suppose if you filed a suit, and then went ahead with these private discussions, you could get attorney's fees?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3033.416,3034.466,--I think that's clear.
1986.85-767,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.73,3177.977,"Do I interpret that last remark to mean that if these regulations were eliminated, that if there were... if the agency were not obliged to and chose not to have such complaint procedures, your mere application to the agency would not suffice?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3177.977,3178.644,--That's clear.
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.41,3210.846,But I don't think you're helped much by the language of the statute.
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3216.666,3224.606,"--I think the same situation is in Title VII, upon which Section 1988 was explicitly modelled."
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3231.36,3232.462,"Well, the Court said that."
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3233.578,3241.483,"And the Court... granted it was dicta, the Court reaffirmed that dicta, though, in White v. State of New Hampshire."
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.483,3243.117,In another dictum?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3243.117,3244.883,Yes.
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.928,3339.428,What was the ECOS action?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3339.428,3343.795,The ECOS action was originally an environmental suit.
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.795,3345.414,It was not a Title VI?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3345.414,3346.014,That's correct.
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3346.014,3348.699,And that's what the injunction was entered under?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3348.699,3349.483,Yes.
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.483,3356.889,And could you have gotten... you couldn't have got attorney's fees just for your success in getting in the injunction?
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3356.889,3357.639,No.
1986.85-767,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.672,3374.684,"So how could the... when the injunction was withdrawn, you thought... you think... that that was an independent ground for your getting attorney's fees for administrative services?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3374.684,3384.456,"--If an independent court action is required, if that anomalous result or practice is required, we did go to federal court on the merits here."
1986.85-767,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3384.456,3386.158,"Well, it's not just a court action."
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3393.228,3396.93,And this... and through our intervention it did become that.
1986.85-767,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3416.278,3417.744,"Mr. Calhoun, may I ask one other question?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3433.889,3436.405,--We don't think it's essential to our claim.
1986.85-767,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.405,3436.821,You don't.
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3436.821,3441.123,But we think it certainly bolsters the claim that this was no friendly get-together we had here.
1986.85-767,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3441.123,3449.046,"You would have the same claim if they had responded to your complaint by just saying, well, we're not sure whether there's a violation, but we'd like you parties to try and negotiate a settlement anyway?"
1986.85-767,2,35664,michael_david_calhoun,,3449.046,3451.665,They were dragged into this conciliation agreement.
1986.85-767,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.033,3458.651,"Thank you, Mr. Calhoun."
1986.85-767,3,35200,lacy_h_thornburg,,3461.536,3465.138,"If Your Honor please, unless the Court has additional questions, we have nothing further."
1986.85-767,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3465.138,3465.838,Thank you.
