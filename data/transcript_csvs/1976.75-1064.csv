1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.835,We will hear arguments next in 1064 Kremens against Bartley.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,49.071,51.771,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,71.599,80.994,"Do you intend to discuss the way you now have your argument plan, the question of the class that was before the court?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,80.994,84.7,"I had not intended to discuss it, in connection with the mootness issue?"
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.7,85.558,No.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,113.187,114.38,That is correct.
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.385,131.601,"Well, but can named plaintiffs all of whom are over 13 represent a class which includes people under 13, if in fact the law treats one differently than the other."
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,131.601,145.857,"Well, I think it can in this case Your Honor because the court when defining the class, also noted certain unmentioned individuals but patient numbers I believe some of those in the record were under the age of 13."
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.857,148.064,But there was no named individual.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,148.064,151.409,"That is correct, that is correct."
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,314.873,318.044,Further in relation to what?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,319.76,323.724,"The new procedures and the old procedures, taken together, the statute and the regulation."
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,349.049,351.709,Because now you have it in statute?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,351.709,357.816,"There is a new statute that applies only to the mentally ill and as I pointed out, that is approximately 20% of the plaintiff class."
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.816,359.129,The rest being mentally retarded.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,359.129,360.502,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.457,422.114,"Well, is not there a question, Mr. Watkins, before you get to the question what kind of a hearing you have, or as to whether there is any state action here â€“ the stilt is depriving anybody of liberty?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,422.114,428.526,The question as I am approaching and I agree with you is whether or not there is a liberty interest involved at all here?
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.579,465.268,"Well, is it that clear, what happens if a child runs away from one of these institutions?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,467.85,472.669,"Well, there are enough set procedures but that is possible."
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.642,484.352,Is there some in the record about this?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,484.352,486.148,I do not believe so.
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,486.148,498.202,Would it stand any different from what it would be if the parents reported missing a child and the police follow their procedures and pick the person up and return him to the family.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,501.138,501.915,That is correct.
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,515.967,526.758,"In Pennsylvania, if the parents with their private physicians take a child within this age category to a private hospital, private institution."
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,529.156,531.839,To a private institution?
1976.75-1064,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,568.475,568.965,What does that mean?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,575.054,579.799,"Well, there are certain qualitative regulations but primarily I appertained with the procedures."
1976.75-1064,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.84,587.679,Precisely as a public institution?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,587.679,589.801,"That is correct, that is correct."
1976.75-1064,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,589.801,594.793,"Mr. Watkins, are all of the institutions named in this case, public institutions?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,594.793,595.099,No.
1976.75-1064,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,598.297,600.411,But are they named bodies?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,600.411,604.053,I do not believe they are. Haverford State Hospital is a public institution.
1976.75-1064,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,604.053,605.758,So the named bodies of public institution.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,605.758,607.802,"That's correct, that's correct."
1976.75-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.802,615.934,"You contend that the issue is here any different with respect to a private placement as opposed to a public placement, that is the nature of the institution."
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,615.934,618.226,With respect to state action or with respect to the company?
1976.75-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.226,619.519,In any respect?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,625.541,626.756,I think not.
1976.75-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,729.433,733.352,Where do you get at the age 14?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,733.352,736.17,That's very good question.
1976.75-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,748.374,750.907,Any of Pennsylvania's adult 14?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,750.907,757.945,"Well, for the purposes of Mental Health Act, yes, 14-year olds and above are treated exactly as adults."
1976.75-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,757.945,760.761,And what other ways it treated as an adult?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,760.761,762.625,"In most other ways, in most other ways --"
1976.75-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.625,763.93,Can he drive a car?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,763.93,765.414,"No he can't, no he can't."
1976.75-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,765.414,766.658,Can he drink liquor?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,766.658,770.229,"No, he can't Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,770.229,779.172,"What the adults could do there, you just say for the purpose of put him into institution he is an adult?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,779.172,780.358,That's correct.
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.003,848.657,"On the other hand if you are dealing with either mentally ill people or mentally retarded people, even adults have some question about their ability to make decisions through themselves?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,848.657,849.385,That's correct.
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,852.92,853.348,That's right.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,856.467,857.941,That's absolutely correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,857.941,865.016,I think the subject whether adults or minor is not capable of making the judgments necessarily alone.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,865.016,866.735,Absolutely correct!
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,933.19,936.327,Or the choice of a private school against the public school or vice versa?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,936.327,940.229,"Absolutely correct, absolutely correct."
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,968.636,973.626,That's why you say that the appropriate remedy is the case by case treatment by way of a habeas corpus proceeding?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,973.626,977.06,"Absolutely, absolutely, Pennsylvania clearly provides that."
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,977.06,980.599,But you can't generalize about such a sensitive problem such as that --
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,980.599,982.072,Not only can but should.
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,993.276,995.63,This case was decided on Fourteenth Amendment?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,995.63,997.027,Exclusively.
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,997.027,1002.333,You just point it out that it was -- everything happened was at the behest of the parents.
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1009.951,1022.211,"Well, the parents couldn't have the effectuated the commitment without the concurrence of the state in a state facility and as the state law pursuant to which the state --"
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.211,1027.596,Is parents' decision to send a child to public school is safe decision?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1027.596,1029.17,No absolutely not.
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.915,1040.029,"Well, there you have state teachers presumably in a public school?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1040.029,1041.358,"Excuse me Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I didn't --"
1976.75-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.358,1050.963,"In Justice Stewart's hypothesis of sending a child to a public school you have got state teachers or county teachers, they may have recommend that the kid go to that school, why is that any different?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1050.963,1068.34,"Well, they may and I assume -- possibly if that were a part of the system, if before you could put your child in a public school let's say, you have to go to the school and school had to say we want your child, your child needs us, that's a little more state action than the present system which is I am living in this district, I am going to send my child to that school --"
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1068.34,1070.327,"You didn't raise any question, excuse me?"
1976.75-1064,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1070.327,1073.054,Probably still the child comes home?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1073.054,1074.792,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.792,1077.58,"Where is the state action, did you raise this at all?"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1077.58,1080.72,This issue was not raised at the trial court level.
1976.75-1064,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1080.72,1084.472,Or haven't till I just asked the question?
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1084.472,1087.747,I believe that I recall in one of the early colloquies.
1976.75-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.77,1112.874,"Mr. Watkins before you sit down, you started by saying they were two issues you were going to talk about; one was whether there was an impact on liberty as I understand it, I never did understand what the second --"
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1112.874,1121.352,"The second issue is assuming that there is an impact on liberty, was lower court's order justified and just briefly there is a checklist which are more fully and I was --"
1976.75-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.352,1122.606,Was this the proper procedure --
1976.75-1064,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1122.606,1131.136,"That's correct, I mean, is it unwise in its breadth, its unsound in its scope, thank you very much."
1976.75-1064,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1131.136,1133.295,Very well.
1976.75-1064,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1146.374,1151.732,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1403.081,1403.772,You will have ten minutes.
1976.75-1064,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1403.772,1405.33,Thank you sir.
1976.75-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.027,1645.404,Is the state judge under this mandate given any discussion about not requiring the child to be present?
1976.75-1064,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1645.404,1647.194,No there is nothing said about that.
1976.75-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.194,1651.625,Mandated to have the subject of the proceeding present in the courtroom.
1976.75-1064,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1651.625,1651.982,Yes.
1976.75-1064,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1732.437,1734.656,They seem to be.
1976.75-1064,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1734.656,1739.191,"First, they argue that the Supreme Court did not ask to be a party."
1976.75-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.497,1888.525,What was wrong in saying that the procedures reported were inadequate?
1976.75-1064,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1888.525,1892.019,"I do not think it was, I mean."
1976.75-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.019,1897.094,"A declaratory judgment aspect of the case, was this Due Process holding wrong or what?"
1976.75-1064,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1897.094,1901.898,"Well, it happens I think it is wrong but I am not arguing that point but I said if it were right, Mr. Justice."
1976.75-1064,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.898,1906.505,"Well, I understand that but what is your position, what is the Supreme Court position on the Due process for it?"
1976.75-1064,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1906.505,1908.017,"Well, I would hesitate to talk about that."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,1930.012,1935.24,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.56,2025.836,"Mr. Ferleger, Let me just interrupt a second."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2038.917,2039.666,Yes.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.666,2045.71,"And therefore are we not necessarily, if we decided one way or the other necessarily deciding the private question as well?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2045.71,2053.652,"With regard to Pennsylvania as well, I do agree that private facilities in Pennsylvania are acting under color of state law."
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2054.331,2057.341,We are already deciding that question in Pennsylvania in this case.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2057.341,2057.812,That is correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2073.507,2080.181,"Well, you say you agree that they are acting on a color of state law, actually you are contend that they are acting under color of state law, don't you?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2082.563,2084.257,That is correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2103.832,2109.673,"And you contend that makes the action of the private facilities when they follow the state law, state actions."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2109.673,2110.588,That is correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2110.588,2113.549,I did not understand maybe I misunderstood.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2145.335,2150.692,"Justice Stewart, I would agree I think that both are alternative grounds that end up with the same result."
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2150.692,2158.071,But the only way a private organization can hold a present against his will is by virtue of state he is already in?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2158.071,2159.226,That is correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2159.226,2162.447,He cannot get out.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2169.62,2171.154,Yes.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.108,2210.433,But again it is decided until the legislatures acts.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2213.603,2225.77,"That is correct but that result Mr. Justice Stevenson and it was discussed in the early argument, is one that was inevitable by the declaratory judgment that the Lower Court entered."
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.918,2269.432,The legislature might provide a different hearings scheme.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2269.432,2271.116,That is correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.116,2278.798,Or could there be a hearing scheme in just without the legislation outside the court.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2278.798,2286.502,There could not have been a hearing scheme in my opinion without legislation.
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.502,2302.351,"You mean a mental health facility in Pennsylvania could not itself in responding to a judgment of a District court institute an administrative hearing on its own, that would satisfy Due Process."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2302.351,2305.038,That would satisfy the opinion in this case.
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.038,2310.057,"Yes, except for the paragraph that, except for the order that you are holding in the courts."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2310.057,2328.057,"In my opinion not because with the declaratory judgment, the only provisions left for admission to mental hospitals where those under the statute and regulations and the Pennsylvania laws was clear that otherwise any mental facility could not admit anyone."
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.057,2330.868,Would have mentioned the original prayer--
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2330.868,2331.861,Excuse me.
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2331.861,2334.662,"With your original prayer, that's all you are asking."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2334.662,2339.664,That is correct but that issue is not presented by the briefs or the facts in this case.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2339.664,2350.297,Do you agree with the state of Pennsylvania that referees could not be appointed by the state courts to perform the function mandated by the Federal court.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2350.297,2354.853,The state courts could certainly appoint the masters or referees to hold hearings.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2396.433,2399.952,Must they be reprocessing as they don't want to be reprocessed?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2399.952,2407.46,"No, Your Honor, I wanted to reply to that and to the question you ask Mr. Segal about presence of person."
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2443.103,2452.354,"No, the idea that anything can be waived is certainly nothing that this District court judge had to say, that is just a generally accepted laws, is not it?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2452.354,2458.905,"The generally accepted law is, as I understand the laws that in criminal cases with exception of an unruly or disrupting --"
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2458.905,2462.701,"As long as knowing and expressed, you can waive anything."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2462.701,2463.703,That is correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2463.703,2471.672,How does a mentally ill 15 year old child consternate on a valiant waiver?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2474.715,2475.351,I will explain.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2500.404,2509.374,That is actually quite a substantial hearing process to make just that preliminary determination might it not?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2509.374,2510.114,It could in some--
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2510.114,2511.753,Psychiatric testimony?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2511.753,2512.811,It could in some cases.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2512.811,2514.003,Testimony of the parents?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2514.003,2533.105,"But those questions are present Mr. Chief Justice, when an adult is committed, when a 35 year old severely retarded person is committed, when a husband attempts to commit a wife, those questions of competency to waive counsel or waive other procedure protections are all present and do not--"
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2533.105,2545.533,Do not the the psychiatrist indicate that there may be a difference between the traumatic impact on young children as against other mentally or emotionally disturbed?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2545.533,2556.71,"I believe that the record indicates very strongly otherwise, and the briefs of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and American Psychological Association, I think, mostly indicate otherwise."
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2558.922,2559.486,Otherwise?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2563.162,2563.89,"No, what I mean is that the--"
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.89,2567.479,...impact on a 15 year old child that goes through a hearing process?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2567.479,2586.758,"What I mean is that the trauma is no greater than that on anyone who goes through a mental commitment process, and what I mean is that whatever trauma there is, the trauma is less than being placed indeterminately in a mental institution with no process at all."
1976.75-1064,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2586.758,2596.525,"May I ask this question, are you defending that full range of procedural Due Process described by a District court?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2596.525,2605.908,"At this point, Mr Justice Powell, and I was about to get to that, I am not to decide -- I do not believe that that question is before this court."
1976.75-1064,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2623.021,2628.084,"It is that not before us, what you perceive to be the central issue?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2628.084,2639.911,"The central issue is whether some kind of hearing, hearing in counsel and notice, those very basic requirements whether that is necessary before a child can be committed."
1976.75-1064,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2652.148,2655.601,"In paragraph 11, before us?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2666.074,2672.44,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I do not believe it is for the reason that I will explain."
1976.75-1064,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.58,2679.28,Now give me a minute.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2681.207,2684.124,It is a white brief.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2684.124,2685.183,What page you are going to?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2685.183,2686.908,One of the white briefs Mr. Justice.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2686.908,2688.428,What page again?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2688.428,2697.846,"At Page 8A at the appendix, is a letter that Mr. Segal referred to as being from an administrative system."
1976.75-1064,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2754.505,2755.403,After this correspondence?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2755.403,2755.561,That is what.
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.445,2779.182,"Well, you said several things are not before us in response to questions from my brothers Brennan and Powell, yet you are asking the court to affirm the judgment of the District Court across the board, are you not?"
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2779.182,2780.791,That is all.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2780.791,2792.435,We are asking the court to affirm the judgment across the board with the caveat that the court is not deciding the very detailed specifics of Due Process.
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2796.622,2806.082,And how can we affirm the judgment of the District court which contains details specifics of Due Process without deciding that those are required by the constitution?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2806.082,2824.654,"I think the reason is that the jurisdictional statement and the issue raised by the appellants in this case was not whether all those specifics apply, but whether the parents-state-child relationship allows a commitment without any kind of hearing at all."
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.654,2833.522,What's in the jurisdictional statement is whether or not the retroactive injunctive relief granted by the Lower court is improper?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2833.522,2834.324,"Right that, that--"
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.324,2838.158,"That is pretty gentle, pretty general question."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2838.158,2850.065,"I think that if you -- an examination of the arguments that are made with regard to that question are not with regard to the specifics, but with regard to the Preiser v. Rodriguez issue."
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.603,2863.865,You say that however far this question might reach it should be interpreted by reading the briefs?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2863.865,2879.69,"Not, what I am saying is that the issue that is presented by that question with regard to the retro-activity is only in my reading of it with regard to the Preiser v. Rodriguez issue and the retro-activity issue."
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.69,2894.464,"Well, do you think the question is here is whether or not the Pennsylvania procedures comport with Due process?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2895.297,2896.162,Yes.
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.162,2896.846,Where?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2900.365,2902.175,The first question I believe it is.
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.175,2908.4,The first question is whether the parents may waive the constitutional rights of juveniles.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2908.4,2909.094,That is right.
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2909.094,2913.581,Is not it necessary in answering that question to decide what the constitutional rights of juveniles are?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2913.581,2927.535,"Yes but I think it is not necessary, maybe this will clarify it to go further than saying that a juvenile is entitled to some kind of hearing, and not I do not think it is necessary to go into everything that the hearing involvsd."
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2927.535,2931.379,"Well then, I do not see how you can affirm the District court."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2931.379,2951.906,"Well, one alternative would be to simply -- I think that this court can state that the District court's requirements are a hearing that would be permissible under the constitution without deciding whether or not the hourly requirements and the days and the presence --."
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2951.906,2958.577,But the District Court has no business imposing its standards on the state of Pennsylvania unless they were mandated by the constitution.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2961.7,2967.072,"Well, our position is of course those are mandated by the constitution in my -- what I was--"
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.072,2973.066,We would have to so hold that we affirm the judgment?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,2973.066,2974.341,I am not certain of that.
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2994.864,3000.169,"But there, we were reversing a judgment that said there were no requirements."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3005.838,3007.155,I see that there is a difference.
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.155,3012.345,"What are you going to say, we have supervisory powers with the courts of Pennsylvania or something."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3012.345,3013.143,"No I don't, I don't really --"
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.143,3016.235,Where do we get the authority?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3016.235,3024.344,The authority in the paragraph Mr. Justice Brennan referred to just say that the courts should hold the hearings into legislature acts.
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3026.991,3029.833,Well within the judgment?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3029.833,3030.624,Yes.
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3030.624,3033.113,And is the judgment here?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3033.113,3033.907,"Yes, the judgement is here."
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3033.907,3035.421,For review.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3035.421,3051.208,But that was an issue not decided by the Lower court because the Lower court at the time that that provision was entered understood that the state courts were going to hold the hearings. And there was no issue or controversy about that.
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3051.208,3053.869,"Well, why didn't they say that?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3054.871,3056.132,That's not in the opinion.
1976.75-1064,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3056.132,3058.294,That's right and it's not before us.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3058.294,3076.503,"If we affirm this judgment, the state of Pennsylvania must do everything that is stipulated in the judgment and the only way that I see of avoiding that would be to affirm it in part and strike down parts of it, do you disagree with that?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3076.503,3084.784,"I think that the court could strike down or at least vacate for reconsideration, certain parts of this argument."
1976.75-1064,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.784,3096.558,"What if a judgment below is attacked only on one or two points, this court has no authority to vacate any other other parts of the judgment."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3100.882,3130.71,"I think, that the question with regard to the commitment issue that procedures of commitment, the question raised by the jurisdictional statement is whether parents can give up children's rights and in this case, what we are asking for is what this court is upheld in mental health cases, since 1917 and what every court has upheld that has considered it, which is the basic right to a chance to tell your side of the story before you are put into a mental hospital."
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.258,3222.453,"Mr. Ferleger, would you address the argument that one of the briefs makes that the procedures that are specified with great and additional stigma to the institutionalization that does not now necessarily exist and to that extent counter productive?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3222.453,3231.778,"As one of our expert witnesses Mr. Justice, even said that, he has never seen that having an attorney or a hearing adds to the stigma."
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3261.472,3270.827,"Did that expert say anything about the trauma of 14 year old, 13 year old going through a contested hearing of this kind?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3270.827,3299.663,"Yes the opinion of the experts was that in fact as the court noted in Gault, the trauma, excuse me, the hearing process can be very therapeutic to whatever extent it is traumatic, it is no more traumatic than it is for adults who have the hearing and whatever trauma there is, it is insignificant compared to the trauma of being locked up in a hospital with no chance to have some fair procedure to determine that."
1976.75-1064,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3299.663,3316.686,"Mr. Ferleger, assuming we reach the issue, what process is due, what do you think of the suggestion that an independent board of psychiatrists would be appropriate to make the independent decision like you suggest is necessary."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3316.686,3334.939,"I think that an independent tribunal of some sort, and it is my own personal opinion, might be appropriate and might withstand constitutional scrutiny of this court should ever be faced with that issue."
1976.75-1064,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3351.034,3355.252,You are not insisting on a judicial decision maker?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3355.252,3367.898,"My own feeling is that the constitution if it was ever presented ought to require and would have required such a hearing, but I have not --"
1976.75-1064,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3367.898,3370.074,Did you say would or would not?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3370.074,3403.15,"Would, but I am not aware of any decision that has faced that question, every other mental health decision in the country in the federal court as well as the state courts requires a judicial hearing, there is the Saville versus Treadway case in Tenesse which in some cases allows an administrative process followed I think by appeal to a court of Judge Gibbons, one of the members of the panel in one hearing in this case raised this a possibility tribunal that was administrative followed by Court of Appeal."
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.15,3419.594,What's the authority of the United States circular District Judge to attempt to that kind of specificity as distinguished from saying the procedure you have is bad because it violates the constitution?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3419.594,3450.698,"I think that the courts have the power to specify some limits to the powers of the states in this regard, I think that, the federal courts can say, I am here with some extreme range, of course, can say that one year in a mental hospital without a hearing is not proper, I think the court's --"
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3450.698,3456.753,"We can't say it's not proper, they have to decide whether or not it violates the constitution."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3456.753,3459.156,That's what I meant.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3483.643,3487.12,"But none of those are constitutional standards per say, are they?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3487.12,3487.927,"No, they are not."
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3487.927,3493.899,"They are merely rogatory suggestions by ut I think those who are interested in the subject matter, are they not?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3493.899,3494.958,That's correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3494.958,3499.93,"But in your regard, the opinion of the District court is requiring an attorney in every case."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3499.93,3501.775,"Yes, the two things --"
1976.75-1064,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3501.775,3503.457,As a constitutional request.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3503.457,3524.608,"Yes, a notice and a hearing and I think that those are the issues that this Court should reach and maybe that as in Gerstein versus Pew this Court may choose to say that the very detailed specifics either were not properly considered or should be left to the states to experiment in the wisdom of the states."
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3527.57,3535.335,Do the states need the benediction of the Federal Court in order to engage in experimentation?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3535.335,3536.922,Not at all.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.922,3548.002,"Suppose the court might observe, the Federal court might observe that that's the system of federalism that they have no authority to tell them to experiment, have they?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3548.002,3551.514,Certainly not Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3551.514,3553.839,Let me ask you two questions before you sit down.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3577.168,3583.113,Certainly Mr. Justice Steven.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3627.165,3631.874,I am not talking only about the cost in the public facilities but the private as well.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3634.605,3639.921,Those figures don't discuss the number of people that came in in to the private facilities.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3639.921,3649.054,Since one of the arguments was that this inevitably the private placements would be governed by this and the cost of the private placement will be affected by the need to hire the counsel and everything.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3649.054,3652.997,It will be a public cost to counsel for the child.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3652.997,3658.199,Even if the parents are not indigent.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3658.199,3660.401,The court did not address that issue.
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3661.057,3672.26,"As I say that the court is absolutely required, non-waivably that counsel be provided but that's going to be provided at the cost of the parents unless they are indigent, isn't it?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3672.26,3678.329,"Well, not necessarily true, for this reason."
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3689.891,3693.978,"They would pay for his meals at least, that is the matter of state law."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3693.978,3702.216,They do but the question about whether a counsel for a child in a possibly adverse situation should be paid by the parents is not clear at all.
1976.75-1064,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3702.216,3708.149,That's a (Inaudible) â€“ there may be an adversary relationship between child and parent as to commitment.
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3708.149,3708.647,Correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3708.647,3711.292,Not all the child have independent --
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3711.292,3711.918,That's correct.
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3716.347,3729.34,"Serves the needs of the child and this court held that it was a constitutional need of a child, then I suppose as a matter of State law that the parents would be required to pay for the child's needs, would they, wouldn't the father or mother?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3729.34,3732.946,I do not believe that that is expressed at all in Pennsylvania law.
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3746.284,3749.174,"But they are generally available, and they are indigent aren't they?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3749.174,3751.853,Yes.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3751.853,3762.841,Do you not see any risk at all of the overdose of Due Process might be just as dangerous as an overdose of insulin shot treatment on a mental patient?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3762.841,3771.516,Not when the Due Process involves procedures that go to the very essence of the fact finding procedure.
1976.75-1064,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3796.448,3802.739,In any of the these occasions were they â€“ did the court find that anybody has been wrongly committed?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3802.739,3806.781,The court -- I will answer your question and then conclude.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3826.209,3828.243,"These were hypothetical cases, were they not?"
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3828.243,3829.766,"No, no."
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3829.766,3835.317,Were they findings on evidence relating to particular members of this class?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3835.317,3844.489,They were findings on evidence that was submitted in response to interrogatories regarding the reasons of commitment of particular individuals.
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3864.254,3867.787,Were these named plaintiffs?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3872.727,3876.796,"The named plaintiffs, their facts are discussed in a brief."
1976.75-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3892.161,3895.481,The District court found that that should not have happened?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3895.481,3900.103,The District court did not discuss whether that should happen or not.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3909.298,3911.578,"Mr. Ferleger, you haven't had a chance to answer my second question."
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3911.578,3915.846,I have realized that.
1976.75-1064,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3918.098,3922.712,The question is what is your reaction to the suggestion in a view the new statute would be a remand statute?
1976.75-1064,2,20870,david_ferleger,,3922.712,3927.191,I don't believe that the new statute is before this court at all.
1976.75-1064,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3969.22,3971.283,Does the state have anything further?
1976.75-1064,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3973.326,3984.168,"I may ask just you the questions presented to a jurisdictional state at page nine, don't seem to be the same questions presented in your brief at page 16."
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,3984.168,3991.338,"That's correct Mr. Justice Brennan, however I believe that the questions covered stated in a jurisdictional statement are sufficiently broad to cover."
1976.75-1064,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3994.069,3999.983,You mean all three in the jurisdictional statements are subsumed in the two at page 16 of your brief?
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,3999.983,4000.495,Yes.
1976.75-1064,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4002.93,4013.508,"I must say, I have a little trouble reading in that way but and also as I read your brief, you did not attach your prospectus assuming that some hearing is necessary."
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,4024.388,4028.905,I did not go to each of the elements of the board or anything --
1976.75-1064,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4028.905,4038.375,"Your attack on the injunction, that one should get passed the declaratory aspect of it, is only with respect to the retrospective impact."
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,4038.375,4048.587,"That's correct Mr. Justice White, however I agree with Mr. Justice Rehnquist that in this case particularly it is extreme very difficult to separate the elements --"
1976.75-1064,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4048.587,4057.456,But your only point on retroactive is that it violates Eleventh Amendment or or that it's powered by Prieser.
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,4057.456,4058.569,That's correct.
1976.75-1064,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4058.569,4063.092,You don't say that the court misread Due Process.
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,4063.092,4065.043,Not with respect to the retroactive application.
1976.75-1064,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4065.043,4069.911,The individual or prospective --
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,4069.911,4076.858,"Yes, it's our contention and I think the brief makes it entirely clear that the present system of Pennsylvania meets the requirements."
1976.75-1064,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4081.778,4083.339,Every item is erroneous.
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,4083.339,4088.032,"Anything over and above, is erroneous as a matter of constitutional law."
1976.75-1064,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4179.807,4180.636,Program of what?
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,4180.636,4194.965,"Respite care, and that allows a parent of a severely retarded juvenile to place his child in an institution for say, four or weeks a year to allow the parent, the necessary respect go on."
1976.75-1064,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4229.783,4232.164,Your time is up.
1976.75-1064,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,4232.164,4233.533,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-1064,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4234.527,4235.24,Thank you Gentlemen.
