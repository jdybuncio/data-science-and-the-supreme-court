2017.17-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.13,6.995,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-21, Lozman versus The City of Riviera Beach. Ms. Karlan."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,6.995,19.375,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government violates the First Amendment whenever it retaliates against someone because they exercise -- criticize public policies or public officials."
2017.17-21,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,72.07,78.15,"That was true of Hartman too, but the Court made a distinction."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,78.15,102.4,"The distinction in Hartman, as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg, comes and rests entirely on the fact that there was absolute prosecutorial immunity for the actor who actually imposed the injury there. And I see three major distinctions between Hartman and what's going on in this case. The first of those is that, in Hartman, there was absolute prosecutorial immunity."
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,154.02,162.5,"So your -- your -- your beginning -- I -- I couldn't quite -- can't quite recall your beginning sentence, but it was hugely broad."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,201.38,201.89,No.
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.89,249.31,"That -- that seems -- I'm -- I'm very concerned about police officers in -- in difficult situations where they have to make quick -- and your -- and your initial formulation just did not cover it, just did not give any protection for that. In this case, there's a very serious contention that people in -- in elected office deliberately wanted to intimidate this person, and it seems to me that maybe in this case we should cordon off or box off what happened here from the ordinary conduct of police officers. And your initial formulation was -- was so blanket that it didn't provide for that."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,249.31,275.705,"I think maybe I -- I didn't state it clearly enough. Our position is that when an officer retaliates against someone for his protected speech, that is, when he has what this Court called in Hartman retaliatory animus, and can't show because of the Mt. Healthy standard that he would have arrested the person anyway, then there is a First Amendment violation. And if I could point to the empirical evidence here."
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,292.23,327.99,"That may be, but that's -- that's exactly what I had as my question too, that it's not that -- you start -- you're down two tracks, it seemed to me. If you say the police officer is liable, if he really has animus, and the probable cause was not, you know, going to affect him, once you say that, you're into the hypothetical of the bar and all you've done is say the jury will decide all those questions. You get to the jury and the jury has a factual question."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,370.38,380.19,So I want to make it clear that the hypothetical is extraordinarily hypothetical because the cases that are brought in the Ninth Circuit now under the rule we're talking about --
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,380.19,382.61,"I'm sure it is, but unfortunately --"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,382.61,383.22,"Yes -- no, I --"
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,383.22,388.57,"-- in my mind, back of it, is the kind of hypothetical -- and it might be extremely hypothetical --"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,388.57,388.68,Yes.
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,388.87,390.95,-- but I would like an answer to that question.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,390.95,391.04,Yes.
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,391.04,394.29,Which route do you want us to take?
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,394.29,422.53,"Those cases are not going to a jury, and the reason those cases are not going to a jury is twofold. First, this Court's pleading rules in Twombly and Iqbal will not let those cases get past a motion to dismiss unless there's direct evidence of the officer saying: I normally don't arrest people under these circumstances, but you I don't like because you're wearing a Make America Great hat or a Black Lives Matter T-shirt or a Choose Life bumper sticker."
2017.17-21,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.04,468.76,"Would that -- would that be the case for this police officer, where, I mean, he -- the -- the animus is one person, Wade, the councilmember, and she tells the officer to make an arrest, but the -- the suit is not against the officer, or if it was, wouldn't the officer have qualified immunity?"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,468.76,472.09,"Yes, Your Honor, the officer here was not a defendant."
2017.17-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,482.335,485.25,"No, I didn't want to interrupt your answer."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,485.25,485.83,"Oh, no, no."
2017.17-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,485.83,488.125,"Well, let's take this particular case then."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,509.455,526.1,"It might be very difficult for him to get to a jury if the level of disruption is such that, under the way this Court has treated plausible pleading in Twombly and Iqbal, it's not plausible to believe that it was the animus that caused the arrest."
2017.17-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,526.1,529.205,Do you really think a suit like that could be dismissed under Twombly?
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,529.205,541.42,"I'm seeing the cases from the Ninth Circuit being dismissed all the time on the grounds that it's just not plausible. And if you have a serious crime, it truly isn't plausible to claim that it's animus."
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,548.91,550.84,But those are cases that have been brought.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,566.935,567.73,Yes.
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,567.73,568.24,Of course.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,568.24,570.36,Is that how it's pronounced? I should have looked it up.
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,571.335,571.87,Reichle.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,572.18,572.49,Yeah.
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,572.49,573.175,Sorry.
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,575.76,596.155,"But -- but in Reichle, Justice Ginsburg wrote a concurrence that I joined that tried to draw a separation between cases like yours and the cases that Justice Kennedy and I had been most concerned about, the riot cases, et cetera. Now -- now what do you think of that?"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,596.155,605.985,"Can I suggest that you look at page 12 of the Joint Appendix in Reichle, because there you will see the complaint, which was a pre-Twombly, pre-Iqbal complaint."
2017.17-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,624.99,625.74,Do you really think that --
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.74,628.31,"Well, if you're telling me -- excuse me, Chief Justice."
2017.17-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,628.31,655.54,"Do you really think that Twombly and Iqbal require the degree of specificity that you postulated, that the only cases that are going to be successfully brought are when the person has a hat on that says that he's a member of a particular group, and the officer says: I don't normally arrest people, but because of your hat with a political message, I'm going to arrest you? Do you really think -- is it a bit of an exaggeration when you say Twombly and Iqbal are going to keep everything but that case out of court?"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,655.54,657.5,I'm not saying it will keep everything out.
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.74,701.145,"Well, just -- just so -- just so you know, and it's in line with the Chief, if you say that the only box you're going to draw for me in this case between the -- to distinguish between the classifications Justice Breyer and I were discussing and this case is Twombly and Iqbal, you've lost me."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,701.145,701.87,"No, I didn't say that."
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,701.87,705.22,Because there Twombly and Iqbal are simply inadequate --
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,705.22,706.07,I didn't say that.
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.07,734.99,"-- it seems to me, to take care of the broad proposition that you began with, and I was curious to know if you have some fallback position so that when there is an allegation, a strong allegation of -- of a deliberate animus by elected officials, and the police officer is a young police officer, he just acts based on their -- on -- on their orders, whether or not that is some special kind of case? And you haven't been able to show me that it is."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,734.99,738.54,I -- I -- I gave you three answers to that.
2017.17-21,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,781.53,788.38,"You -- you said, Ms. Karlan, that this would not -- never apply. You think that in serious crimes this would never get to a jury."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,789.925,791.6,I think that's -- that's correct.
2017.17-21,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,791.6,792.59,Why is that?
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,792.59,807.85,"Because it would not be plausible to say, unless you had extraordinary evidence of animus, that a police officer would not arrest somebody for rape or burglary or murder, things -- serious crimes like that."
2017.17-21,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,807.85,824.84,"Do you think it would be appropriate for us to say something, if we were to rule in your client's favor, that with respect to felonies, this -- this should -- we don't expect this to go to juries much, if at all?"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,824.84,827.48,"Well, certainly, that would require reversal in our case."
2017.17-21,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,839.01,839.8,But serious crimes.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,839.8,841.295,"Serious crimes, yes."
2017.17-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,853.595,875.47,"Well, we get a lot of cases, particularly from where you've said, the cases you've looked at, where qualified immunity is applied in a case where we found it necessary to -- to reverse. I'm not sure that it's as solidly established a doctrine as -- as you suggest to protect -- to -- to leave -- we can allow this action because qualified immunity will take care of the -- the problems."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,875.47,945.5,"I -- I think the main thing to focus on here is, if you adopt an absolute bar rule, which is the rule that the Eleventh Circuit has, you're not just knocking out close cases, you're knocking out cases where courts have found that there is a long-standing animus, that there was no justification. And in this case, the city is asking for far more than Hartman, because in Hartman, all he had to show was there was no probable cause for the arrest of prosecution. Here, the city wants us to show not only that there was no probable cause for the only crimes with which my client was ever charged, but there was no probable cause for anything anywhere in the Florida statutes. And that is an extraordinarily broad rule that says to City Council members and says to cities -- if I could use a case, Justice Breyer, in which you wrote the opinion last year -- in Heffernan, you said it's a First Amendment protected activity to have a sign on your front lawn. Well, if the police chief there instead of demoting the deputy had simply said, wait until he steps off the curb, or wait until he drives five miles over the speed limit, arrest him, and make sure it's on a Friday so he can spend the --"
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,945.5,959.67,"You've got the facts. Of course, your case is quite different from what's worrying me and what's worrying me and I think Justice Kennedy perhaps, and that is imagine a serious riot situation."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,982.3,983.17,It -- it -- it will.
2017.17-21,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.17,985.52,"Well, it will because they wouldn't have been arrested."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1034.33999995,1036.43,I think the answer is yes.
2017.17-21,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1052.01,1067.24,"So I think, Ms. Karlan, that the -- the reference in Reichle that Justice Breyer was referring to talks about swift on-the-spot decisions where the safety of persons is in jeopardy. Is that the sort of language that you think would be appropriate to --"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1067.24,1067.42,"Yes, it --"
2017.17-21,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1067.42,1072.73,-- guard against the kind of hypotheticals that Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy are talking about?
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1072.73,1090.89,"Yes, I think you can say there is no absolute bar, but we understand that when there is a danger to people and when an officer has to make split-second decisions, he's entitled either to judgment on a 12(b)(6) motion or he's entitled to qualified immunity or he's entitled to summary judgment."
2017.17-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1094.42,1113.68,I -- I need some help with what you've said about qualified immunity because I -- I legitimately don't understand it. I -- I don't think there's ever a situation in which a reasonable officer could think that it is lawful to retaliate based on the exercise of First Amendment rights.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1127.945,1140.79,"Well, in the case where there is a legitimate dispute over whether the officer acted with retaliatory animus, he will not be able to get qualified immunity --"
2017.17-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1140.79,1140.99,Right.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1141.05,1141.53,-- but that's different.
2017.17-21,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1141.53,1145.99,"-- qualified immunity doesn't -- well -- yeah, qualified immunity won't help in that situation."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1167.005,1171.13,I -- I don't think it's fair to say you'll be able to infer it under those circumstances.
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1282.74,1291.96,"Incidentally, let me just -- a very small factual matter, was the councilmember that presided at this hearing the same one that had presided at earlier hearings?"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1291.96,1293.68,No.
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1305.9,1306.96,"Well, I --"
2017.17-21,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1306.96,1307.19,The --
2017.17-21,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.19,1308.49,-- I guess I'll just say it once again.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1323.045,1337.66,"No, I think all you have to say here is there is no absolute bar rule. That's all we're asking the Court to do, is to say the Eleventh Circuit's rule is wrong. The Ninth Circuit's rule, which is a workable rule, says probable cause is a relevant factor."
2017.17-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1384.775,1401.505,"Counsel, I was surprised you didn't make more of the fact that the basis for probable cause that the city eventually came up with, disturbing the assembly, was not one that they -- the officer, I don't know exactly where, listed or advanced as their justification."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1410.93,1431.535,"I -- I think what's going on there is that if you have to show a Fourth Amendment violation in order to show a First Amendment violation, we're kind of tied in by Devenpeck because what this Court said there is you don't need to have probable cause for the -- for the offense of arrest in order to defeat a Fourth Amendment claim."
2017.17-21,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1432.07,1438.615,"That's true in the Fourth Amendment context, but would it necessarily hold in the First Amendment context, I believe is the Chief Justice's question?"
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1438.615,1439.05,Sure.
2017.17-21,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1449.14,1450.48,Do you recommend that?
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1450.48,1452.57,I would -- I would love that.
2017.17-21,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1452.57,1453.69,In your case.
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1453.69,1454.81,"In our case, we would love that."
2017.17-21,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1454.81,1456.35,But is it a good rule? Meaning --
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1456.35,1464.075,"We think the best rule is the rule we advocated for, which is that probable cause is relevant evidence but not always dispositive."
2017.17-21,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1476.37,1523.495,"If we do away with Devenpeck, though, as -- if I remember here, the -- the sergeant, I think, or whomever initially looked at the case said there is grounds for probable cause, but we're not going to get a conviction, so that's why we're not going to proceed. Now the judge said there's no probable cause on the facts as they existed, but you can well imagine that officers filled with animus could scour the books at the booking station and they could look for something that might fit the day as well but still not have been something they would have otherwise arrested for."
2017.17-21,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1523.495,1531.74,"Sure, which is why we think the best rule is that probable cause is relevant but not dispositive. If I may reserve the remainder of my time."
2017.17-21,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.74,1542.89,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dvoretzky."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1542.89,1558.845,"Mr. Chief Justice, and -- and may it please the Court: During Ms. Karlan's argument, I wrote -- wrote down four potential backstops to address the hypothetical -- the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy raised and that Justice Breyer echoed about a police officer dealing with a riot in a bar."
2017.17-21,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1653.36,1664.55,"Mr. Dvoretzky, I want to give you an opportunity to address each of your four if you want, but -- but if I may say, I mean, Ms. Karlan was having some difficulty with hypotheticals."
2017.17-21,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1671.495,1697.11,"-- move you to the facts of your case and suggest the kind of dangers that it poses, which is that in a local government, there are people who become real sort of pains to local officials, and -- and local officials want to retaliate against them, for all the various things they say, charging corruption, doing whatever Mr. Lozman did."
2017.17-21,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1708.015,1725.78,"So you follow somebody around and they commit a traffic violation of a pretty minor kind, and all of a sudden you're sitting in jail for 48 hours before they decide to release you. So that's a pretty big problem, it seems to me, and it's right here in kind of the facts of this case."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1728.55,1739.62,"Justice Kagan, let me respond to that, first, in terms of the facts of this case and then more generally about the legal rule that ought to be -- that ought to be drawn here. A couple of critical things about the facts of this case."
2017.17-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1750.33,1757.97,Wasn't he told to arrest -- didn't Wade say call the officer?
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1757.97,1762.13,"Councilperson Wade said call the officer, but Officer Aguirre made the decision to arrest."
2017.17-21,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1774.08,1781.985,Let's -- let's assume that this officer has qualified immunity and that perhaps he didn't even violate the law anyway.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1785.41,1791.2,"So the City Council, first, we could discuss the transcript."
2017.17-21,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.24,1815.51,You're talking about the closed -- the closed meeting?
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1815.51,1816.265,Correct.
2017.17-21,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1816.265,1817.31,Okay.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1817.31,1844.14,"And if, in fact, there were some sort of a plan to get at Mr. Lozman, why would the City Council have let him speak uninterrupted many times, both before and after the particular incident that was at issue here? And why would the jury have found in the city's favor not only on this claim but also on the other forms of Mr. -- of retaliation that Mr. Lozman alleged? So, on the facts of this case, first of all, I dispute Ms. Karlan's characterization of them."
2017.17-21,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1851.78,1857.445,"Well, regardless of what happened before or after, I found the video pretty chilling."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1873.755,1879.3,"Well, there was probable cause in that situation to arrest him for unlawful disturbance."
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1888.93,1891.72,He was on topic. Assume that fact.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1904.83,1909.27,Because the corruption that he alleged related to Palm Beach County corruption.
2017.17-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.99,1919.065,The city is within the county?
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1919.065,1923.755,"The city is within the county, but that -- that is the line that the policy drew."
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1944.92,1945.55,"I'm sorry, though, that --"
2017.17-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.55,1983.40499995,"But Hartman -- Hartman turned very much on the -- the prosecutor and the assurance that the prosecutor is going to be a check against -- you know, you had the postal inspectors and -- but it was the prosecutor who made the decision to prosecute. And here there's no one like the prosecutor who has absolute immunity and is a -- is a person that we generally think of as upright."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1999.33,2004.405,"Justice Ginsburg, I respectfully disagree with that characterization of Hartman."
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2050.83,2058.78,"But I'm sorry, we don't -- we don't disagree that police officers shouldn't be arresting for retaliatory intent."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2058.78,2060.14,Correct.
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2060.5,2060.65,All right.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2110.85,2112.42,Justice Sotomayor --
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2112.42,2120.55,"Now I know you say something else will take care of it, but the reality is something else usually doesn't take care of it."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2120.55,2128.47,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I think the premise of your question is that there is an epidemic of retaliatory arrests out there that --"
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2128.47,2128.61,No.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2168.12,2183.08,"First, because there is no workable system to carve off just this case from the mine-run bar incident case. Second, because there are other remedies besides damages actions in individual cases. And, third, because having surveyed --"
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2183.08,2183.56,"No, there's no remedy --"
2017.17-21,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2183.56,2208.09,"If that -- if that is so, then the First Amendment is in trouble. In -- in this case, it seems to me, you might argue with the evidence, but that there is evidence that there was a pre-determined plan to arrest somebody on account of his political speech in a political forum. And it seems to me that that is a very serious First Amendment problem."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2230.305,2242.46,"Justice Kennedy, as in Hartman, the Court said it was not possible to create a workable system that would cabin off a particular kind of speech or a particular kind of violation."
2017.17-21,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2268.28,2304.7,"But, counsel, why doesn't it account for your concerns what the Chief Justice suggested, which is perhaps probable cause to arrest for the charge made would tend to defeat an inference of retaliation, but to imagine probable cause for an offense ginned up years later at trial after scouring the books and the judge sending everyone to do more homework to find more statutes and more books. Why might that not be different and that raise an inference of retaliation?"
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2304.7,2307.92,"Because, Justice Gorsuch, of the teaching of Devenpeck that --"
2017.17-21,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2307.92,2310.95,"Well, that's the -- that's the Fourth Amendment context."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2317.125,2323.17,"It is in the Fourth Amendment, but the core teaching of it is -- is that police officers are not lawyers."
2017.17-21,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2340.24,2340.66,For certain.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2359.755,2365.39,"Again, because police officers simply are not trained to think in that particular mindset."
2017.17-21,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2374.17,2374.6,Fair enough.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2389.77,2401.54,"Justice Gorsuch, the only reason that this was all determined at trial is that Mr. Lozman, before trial, did not serve us with interrogatories and ask us specifically what offenses we were claiming probable cause for."
2017.17-21,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2402.18,2418.75,"If that doesn't -- if that doesn't work, what you started out, and I wanted to hear your answer, and this is just one add to the mix, but the mix, it seems to me, consists, for the bar and riot cases, et cetera, one, they say start with the Mt. Healthy framework."
2017.17-21,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2464.56,2472.61,"-- but -- but none -- none -- none -- nonetheless, what -- what harm would happen to the interests that you've heard articulated?"
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2472.61,2485.66,"The harm that would happen is that this Court has repeatedly recognized that police officers need objective bright-line rules, not five- or six- or seven-factor tests that they then need to apply on the ground."
2017.17-21,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2485.66,2487.62,I didn't mean it as a five- or six- or seven-factor test.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2516.215,2521.365,"Justice Breyer, the Ninth Circuit has tried to apply exactly that approach."
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2537.525,2538.035,Sorry.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2597.34,2599.94,Sometimes they are and sometimes they're not.
2017.17-21,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2620.61,2632.87,"I -- I'm sorry, we have -- we have a difference of opinion and perhaps -- I don't think I have to recite each -- go through each case, but I don't think that was merely the reason in most, if not all, of them."
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2632.87,2646.08,"I think if you look at cases like Holland or the chalking case or Mihailovici, those are cases where the reason that there was a triable question was simply a difference of opinion about what happened."
2017.17-21,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2720.05,2724.605,I'm -- I'm confused by -- you keep talking about the police officer.
2017.17-21,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2748.185,2751.005,If I may briefly respond.
2017.17-21,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2776.045,2785.345,"Thank you, counsel. General Wall."
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2785.345,2789.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have three points."
2017.17-21,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2950.24,2975.705,"Mr. Wall, we allow people to sue under 1983 for discriminatory arrests under the equal protection clause and without showing anything about whether probable cause exists or not. What has been the experience with respect to those cases? And why is this area -- why should the rule be any different than that one?"
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2975.705,2985.505,"So I think what we'd say is different for a couple of reasons but one similarity, and this was one of the legal points I wanted to make. Those cases are about race."
2017.17-21,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3046.76,3072.025,"One of the grounds, and I don't -- I'm not quite sure how you could use it, we've been talking about how bad the facts are and yet how difficult it is to apply. This is not a situation where the police are out in the street and something's happened and they're looking at, you know, what kind of slogans they have, what they're shouting, a lot's going on. This is, you know, in the City Council, during a time specifically set aside for citizens to talk about whatever the Council is talking about and comment on it."
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3081.6,3085.57,"So maybe right there at the tail end, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.17-21,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3140.36,3146.57,"But you say that, not on-the-spot, and you also say here they're suing a person who is not a policeman."
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3156.905,3157.27,"No, I --"
2017.17-21,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3157.27,3164.085,"And, therefore, since you have to show the causal connection between this decision and the other person who is the policeman, it doesn't really affect the police."
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3164.085,3182.2,"Oh, Justice Breyer, if the Court designs a rule in such a way that it recognizes this is the one-in-a-thousand, and it wants to pick up that one, though not the others, that's not what the Court did in Hartman, but I suppose it could do it here. I think the easier way to analyze it is to say, look -- and Petitioner doesn't dispute that this is the basic question at page 9 of their reply."
2017.17-21,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3200.19,3200.6,But one reason they --
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3200.6,3201.74,They both got a very hard --
2017.17-21,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3201.74,3219.35,"One reason they are different is because, in Hartman, you had an indictment and you just looked at the indictment and said: Is there probable cause for that or not? I mean, here we have this ridiculous spectacle of going through the statute books for a month, trying to find something that this man may have violated."
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3224.345,3242.835,"Look, I completely agree. Again, it's difficult and -- and we -- Petitioner hasn't challenged Devenpeck here, so we haven't had the opportunity to brief it and we would very much like to do so, because I -- I -- I think it's too easy to just say discard the Devenpeck rule. Because what the court said in Devenpeck is: Look, police arrest on the basis of a course of conduct."
2017.17-21,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3262.18,3262.75,How about before --
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3262.75,3263.98,-- you've gotten all the way to trial.
2017.17-21,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3263.98,3266.32,How about before trial? (Laughter.)
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3266.32,3279.715,"So I -- Justice Gorsuch, I think a before-trial rule would be perfectly fine, again, as long -- because I think it reflects the realities of policing, which is that police aren't lawyers."
2017.17-21,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3342.06,3381.245,"Mr. Wall, you keep on saying one-in-a-thousand, but might there not be a problem that now that we have this case and we have to decide this case, and if we decide it your way, you know, maybe it's a green light to everybody to make it not the one-in-a-thousand case and to start really going -- you know, there are lots of small towns in America and there are lots of cranks in those small towns, and there are lots of relationships that go sour between officials and some members of the populace. And, you know, what about that? What about, you know, finding that guy every time he doesn't quite stop when he makes a right on red and putting him in jail for a while?"
2017.17-21,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3381.245,3402.315,"So a couple of things. One, again, I don't think we ought to believe that the only bulwark against backsliding on the First Amendment is damages suits, but more importantly, what I'd say is if that's the kind of rule they want you to put in place, they ought to have to show that the common law, which had this rule for hundreds of years, was a problem. They ought to have to show you that Hartman has created an epidemic of retaliatory prosecutions."
2017.17-21,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3419.98,3421.94,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Ms. Karlan."
2017.17-21,3,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3421.94,3425.53,Thank you.
2017.17-21,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3581.64,3582.94,"Thank you, counsel."
