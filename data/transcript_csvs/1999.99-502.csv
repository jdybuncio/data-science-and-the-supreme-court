1999.99-502,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.4,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-502, Donald E. Nelson v. Adams USA."
1999.99-502,0,20744,debra_j_dixon,,72.349,77.539,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.747,142.303,"Ms. Dixon, I take it that you don't challenge the fact that the pleadings were amended to add the petitioner."
1999.99-502,0,20744,debra_j_dixon,,142.303,144.422,"I do challenge that, Your Honor."
1999.99-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.522,158.722,Was any objection made below at that time to the amendment?
1999.99-502,0,20744,debra_j_dixon,,158.722,164.714,"--There was an object... there was a motion filed to alter or amend the judgment, but there was no formal objection."
1999.99-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,169.739,180.69,"That's exactly what's bothering me about the case, because it seems that the obvious objection would be that it wasn't... that justice didn't require the amendment under Rule 15."
1999.99-502,0,20744,debra_j_dixon,,203.564,210.619,"Your Honor, the waiver rule specifically states that one must assert a defense at their first opportunity."
1999.99-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,223.731,227.781,"Oh, that may be, but unfortunately I gather that that issue is waived."
1999.99-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,240.342,242.024,--Your client wasn't there below.
1999.99-502,0,20744,debra_j_dixon,,242.866,244.512,"Precisely, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.512,247.78,"Your client couldn't have waived it below, because your client hadn't been served and therefore was not present."
1999.99-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,247.78,248.444,I misspoke.
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1661.019,1671.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-502,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.769,1689.977,Where can we find that motion?
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1695.779,1698.653,"--I don't recall, Your Honor."
1999.99-502,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.653,1699.247,So what are you reading--
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1699.247,1701.595,There's a docket item number 133--
1999.99-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.595,1704.454,--I find that extraordinary.
1999.99-502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1717.484,1744.84,"Well, Mr. Wheat, at least on page 3 of... yes, page 3 of your brief you say that on April 8 Nelson, appearing individually, brought a motion to amend, and this was, as I understand it from the sequence you set out, the first pleading that Nelson filed after being joined as a party, and you say... again, I'm still on page 3 of your brief... that he raised two claims."
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1777.614,1789.926,"--To address your question, Your Honor, in section 1 of the motion to vacate, they acknowledged he was a party and requested that the order be amended to delete him as a party."
1999.99-502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1789.926,1813.904,"Well, I assume what they meant was, he's a party because you've just issued an order saying he is one, but... and taking the pleading as you've described it in your own brief, his next statement was, I am not a party, or was not a party through the litigation, and that makes... I guess that doesn't make any sense to me except on the theory that he's saying, you have no jurisdiction over me."
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1813.904,1816.578,"Your Honor, I understand your point."
1999.99-502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1822.214,1831.547,"Well, it was not challenged using the word, jurisdiction, but what else was he getting at in the second part of his motion to amend the judgment?"
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1841.034,1851.009,"The way this case progressed, Your Honor, was that eventually led into the argument made on appeal by analogy to the civil rights cases that a fee award was not--"
1999.99-502,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.009,1854.44,"Okay, but if I may interrupt you, just go back to this question."
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1864.423,1866.329,"--And which section are you referring to, Your Honor?"
1999.99-502,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.329,1868.877,"I'm on page 3 of your brief, the bottom of the page."
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1909.3,1911.43,"Your Honor, I'm--"
1999.99-502,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.43,1912.368,What else was he doing?
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1912.873,1916.026,"--He was saying, I'm not liable for this fee award--"
1999.99-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.026,1917.836,Under 285.
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1917.836,1918.51,--Under 285.
1999.99-502,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.51,1919.703,He said that in the first part.
1999.99-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.703,1919.922,Right.
1999.99-502,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1919.922,1921.583,Now we're at the second part.
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1926.627,1930.571,"Was not a party when the judgment was originally entered, yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-502,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.367,1935.803,Isn't he contesting the jurisdiction of the court to make him pay the fee award?
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1935.803,1939.889,I do not read that as a challenge to the jurisdiction.
1999.99-502,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.402,1949.523,Rule 15 relates to what parties must do.
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,1968.569,1983.766,"Justice Ginsburg, as I read the Rule 15 argument it was about the timing, not the question of whether he was made a party... questioning the timing, was it too late in the proceeding to make him a party, and that question's been waived in this Court."
1999.99-502,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.31,1990.001,But you don't waive a question when you are not in the litigation at all.
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,2016.977,2020.143,"--Your Honor, it was a peculiar procedure."
1999.99-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.227,2043.703,I don't know any other way to reasonably interpret his first appearance.
1999.99-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.556,2066.511,--May I ask you a preliminary--
1999.99-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.511,2067.469,--like a jurisdictional objection.
1999.99-502,1,33376,jack_a_wheat,,2072.862,2076.913,"Your Honor, I understood it to be two objections."
1999.99-502,2,20744,debra_j_dixon,,3331.867,3334.407,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-502,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3337.43,3357.407,"Would you clarify for me why, in your petition for cert, you said that petitioner does not challenge the district court's decision to grant respondents leave to amend the complaint and to join petitioner as a new party defendant, and to do so after judgment had been rendered?"
1999.99-502,2,20744,debra_j_dixon,,3362.844,3378.55,"No, it isn't, Your Honor, because even conceding the district court's ability to perfect all three of those items, it does not obviate Mr. Nelson's right to service of process and the right to be heard."
1999.99-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3401.875,3415.087,"Ms. Dixon, how do you explain the statement by the trial court here on your later application for a 60(b) motion?"
1999.99-502,2,20744,debra_j_dixon,,3445.62,3448.026,"Your Honor, I respond to that quite directly."
1999.99-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3469.941,3493.369,"You... well, I mean, it seems a reasonable rule laid down in that denial of the motion that the Federal rules provide that these defenses are waived if not made in the party's first responsive pleading or motion, and you're saying that you didn't have to make those defenses in your first motion?"
1999.99-502,2,20744,debra_j_dixon,,3493.369,3505.567,"Correct, Your Honor, because, as we had addressed during my initial argument, Mr. Nelson's filing the Rule 59 motion would have been a special appearance, and he would not have been subject to the jurisdiction of the court by virtue of the same."
