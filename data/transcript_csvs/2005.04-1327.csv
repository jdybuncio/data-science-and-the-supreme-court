2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.23,We'll hear argument next in Holmes v. South Carolina.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,5.626,9.366,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,45.324,49.747,"Now, there's some dispute as to whether that... that is really what... what it held."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,96.749,98.355,"Yes, Justice Scalia, I am."
2005.04-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,143.129,160.069,"Well, I... I suppose that in a purely discretionary system... I... I can't quite think of the hypothetical... the strength of the prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of relevance and materiality as to the evidence the defense wants to introduce."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,195.287,207.252,I think that it is possible that under some circumstances not the strength of the State's case but the evidence as a whole may shed some light on whether the third party guilt evidence is relevant.
2005.04-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,243.272,245.697,Suppose that everything in this case were the same.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,263.78,264.263,If the South Carolina--
2005.04-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,264.263,266.628,"Now, in your opinion is that constitutional?"
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,266.628,273.338,"--Just to make sure I understand it, if the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case on these facts had said this was a 403."
2005.04-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,273.338,273.729,Yes.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,273.729,274.019,No.
2005.04-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,274.923,275.283,Because?
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,275.283,285.825,"--under this Court's decision in Olden v. Kentucky that this Court has recognized that evidentiary rulings, based on the strength of the evidence in this case, can be arbitrary and capricious and deprive a defendant of--"
2005.04-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,285.825,286.426,"Well, what they'll say--"
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,286.426,287.329,--defense.
2005.04-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,287.329,292.103,"--if they want to build it out, is they'll say, look, there... there is DNA evidence here."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,327.18,332.726,"Well, that ruling in this case would be unconstitutional because it would be a mischaracterization of what Mr. Holmes' evidence was."
2005.04-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,332.726,332.966,Good.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,333.948,335.142,Challenging the DNA evidence.
2005.04-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,338.142,346.537,And the key points that suggest that what I just said is not a fair characterization or a correct characterization are?
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,346.537,371.984,"--That the evidence in this case... that even the FBI agents who testified for the government admitted the DNA could have been placed through the incompetent handling of the evidence by Officer Mobley, that without gloves and with all the evidence in his possession, he inventoried the items, including Mr. Holmes' clothing and the victim's clothing, stuck his hands in the bag, determined what was in there without washing them or gloves, stuck his hand in another bag, determined what was in there."
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,416.808,422.104,"Counsel, where... where in the record is the testimony of the FBI agents that you were referring to?"
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,422.104,424.341,--It's... it's in the joint appendix.
2005.04-1327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.493,449.628,"What about... what about the DNA... the exclusion of the alleged perpetrator, of White?"
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,459.457,461.612,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.914,527.863,"Mr. Blume, I... I know you're more concerned about... about what result you get in this case and... and whether your client gets another trial or not."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,585.825,590.96,"Well, I would say, Justice Scalia, that that's the way the 49 other States do it."
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,605.916,609.285,Where... where do you think it says you have to overcome the prosecution's case?
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,609.285,610.709,--In the Holmes opinion.
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,610.709,616.117,It's a... it's a factor that's considered in weighing the admissibility and relevance of the third party guilt.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,623.098,629.657,The... the holding in Mr. Holmes' case is Holmes simply cannot overcome the forensic evidence against him.
2005.04-1327,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,629.657,630.338,No.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,666.225,669.033,"Well, there has not been a... a decision since then."
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,694.109,703.177,"Well, you say you don't object to the... the Gregory standard, and the Gregory standard is the one Justice Souter just quoted, raise a reasonable inference as to his own innocence."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,731.09,743.677,"Well, I... I think because, one, if you do that, you could supplant... you... you have made the judge the jury, and the defendant, in order to present evidence of his innocence, have to... has to win a trial before the trial... before the judge."
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,743.677,743.807,"No, not at all."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,777.018,781.007,"I... first of all, there is no other State that does it that way."
2005.04-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,789.965,792.413,"Well, I'm... I'm just not sure that's the case."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,806.224,807.838,--403--
2005.04-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.838,813.478,"Now... now, if you want to say there's a more wooden rule and a... and a more iron rule here that was prejudicial, I think that's something else."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,813.478,818.793,"--There... there is, and I think the South Carolina rule is a categorical rule based on the description."
2005.04-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,838.812,846.858,"But is it your argument that the State's evidence can't be considered at all, or that it can't be given more than a certain amount of weight?"
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,849.024,863.507,"I think that you cannot... that as a general matter, a State cannot require a defendant to persuade a judge of his likely innocence before he can present evidence to the jury that he's innocent."
2005.04-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,867.749,868.513,"Yes, but the State doesn't go that far."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,887.169,889.564,--I think it depends what consideration means.
2005.04-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,911.583,912.786,But where is the line?
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,935.864,939.496,I think that would be... because that is implicitly weighed.
2005.04-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,942.847,944.03,And that would be unconstitutional as well.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,944.03,944.591,--I think that's unconstitutional.
2005.04-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,953.948,956.526,That makes it sound like it can't be considered at all.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,956.526,961.742,"--That... well, only for relevance and possibly for some 403's because that's looking at the 403 part."
2005.04-1327,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,962.546,974.509,"What if the... what if the court says, we will weigh it to the extent of determining whether, in light of the State's case, the proffered evidence, if accepted, would pass the laugh test?"
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,978.955,983.067,--I think that that is problematic.
2005.04-1327,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1028.323,1033.057,But that does go... somehow that goes beyond mere relevance.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1057.389,1063.689,"Yes, but you're not considering how strong the government's case is and conditioning admissibility--"
2005.04-1327,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1063.689,1063.94,No.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1070.118,1070.479,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.057,1138.636,"You think... you think there's no difference where really very questionable evidence about some third party's guilt is... is produced in a case where... where the State's case barely makes it over the... over the line to get to the jury and you think it's... it's the same call where that barely questionable third party evidence is... is put in in opposition to a State's case that is... is watertight... I mean, you know, forensic evidence, all sorts of proof."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1141.083,1143.729,"Yes, well, I do for the following reason."
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1156.306,1157.399,But that's the... that's the problem.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1219.996,1225.826,"Well, Chief Justice Roberts, I submit that that is, one, not correct factually."
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1227.08,1227.821,You mean on... in your case.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1227.821,1230.039,"--Well, it's not... it's certainly not true on the facts of this case."
2005.04-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.303,1252.957,Does the other side agree with that?
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1262.125,1264.711,--I think--
2005.04-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.711,1270.007,What's your authority for... for the... for opposition that every other jurisdiction does it that way?
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1270.007,1287.672,"--I think if you go through the cases, even in the amicus brief, filed by the State of Kansas, they were able to come up with two decisions one, an unreported decision from the D.C. Circuit; and the other, an intermediate decision by the California Court of Appeal, which took into account the strength of the State's case."
2005.04-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1299.816,1315.433,"Well, I... I guess my... my point... maybe it's some of my colleagues' point... is that really the strength of the government's case is subsumed within the general calculus of whether or not this would cause a delay of... of time, whether it would get into extraneous issues, et cetera."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1315.433,1317.781,"--Well, it's... it's not--"
2005.04-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.781,1318.524,It's a way of phrasing it.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1318.524,1322.637,"--That's not the way the decisions, if you read them and read the evidence, that they work."
2005.04-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.521,1342.836,We're not arguing about that.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1349.848,1353.327,"Well, you don't have to... you can't consider it the way South Carolina is."
2005.04-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.353,1442.325,Not... not harmless you mean.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1442.325,1442.897,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1468.124,1471.443,But there wasn't much evidence against him other than the forensic evidence.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1474.954,1479.657,"There wasn't even... yes, there was some evidence that he was within a mile--"
2005.04-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1479.657,1480.068,Right.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1480.068,1481.422,--or so at the time.
2005.04-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1486.96,1490.59,So the jury must have found that forensic evidence to be very convincing.
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1490.59,1493.93,"Well, they found him guilty based on it, yes."
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1512.728,1529.067,"What do you say in... you cited us to footnote 8 in the court's opinion, and it says that your claims do not eliminate the fact that 99.99 percent of the population, other than your client and the victim, were excluded as contributors to the DNA evidence that was found."
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1532.145,1537.602,"--The court is right, to the extent that it is citing one expert's opinion."
2005.04-1327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1615.625,1617.633,That's a question on which we didn't grant cert.--
2005.04-1327,0,29334,john_h_blume,,1617.633,1619.187,--You did not.
2005.04-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.691,1655.706,"Thank you, Mr. Blume."
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2745.562,2751.981,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1327,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2806.918,2807.329,Okay.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2827.63,2839.896,"We... we believe that the raise a reasonable inference of innocence standard, as the counsel for South Carolina said, does not necessarily require that it be the only inference--"
2005.04-1327,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2839.896,2842.795,"Well, one of the problems is I don't know what it requires."
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2888.902,2892.201,--And I think your formulation is actually a fair one.
2005.04-1327,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2893.094,2893.785,"Well, I included several."
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2894.366,2897.977,"--The second one, does it raise some reasonable possibility of innocence."
2005.04-1327,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2899.371,2899.582,--Okay.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2899.582,2907.473,"--does it raise a reasonable possibility of innocence, not... not that it's the most likely or the only possibility from that evidence."
2005.04-1327,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2933.013,2936.161,Has anybody else looked at the evidence on both sides?
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2936.161,2940.053,The trial court certainly looked at the defendant's evidence.
2005.04-1327,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.053,2940.484,Other States I mean.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2941.566,2942.671,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1327,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2981.568,2982.923,Can we... can we just back up to Cabrera?
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2988.015,2988.658,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1327,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.658,2998.927,"--and unless the rule has changed, it didn't have... it didn't have any precedential effect... those opinions that they did not put in the Federal Reports."
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,2998.927,3000.181,"I think its reasoning stands on its own, Your Honor."
2005.04-1327,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3027.152,3033.162,"Suppose there had been evidence that the time of death testimony had been contrived, planted, fabricated."
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3036.731,3040.543,I... I think it would be within the... the trial court's discretion to exclude it.
2005.04-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.944,3046.572,"But if he did, he would be making a credibility determination, wouldn't he?"
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3050.824,3056.772,"--It's not our position, Your Honor, that... that the trial court can make credibility determinations, but--"
2005.04-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.772,3059.982,But the example that Justice Kennedy gave you was such a determination.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3059.982,3064.565,"--I... I think, though... I... I suppose that would depend on the nature of the specific evidence at issue."
2005.04-1327,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3067.032,3069.308,Why wasn't it in the baby shaking case?
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3069.308,3070.382,--I'm sorry?
2005.04-1327,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.382,3076.622,Why was there no credibility determination made in the baby shaking case you just described?
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3086.761,3098.887,"I... I think, Your Honor, that the trial judge found that... that there simply wasn't a dispute about that, that... that the... that there wasn't enough."
2005.04-1327,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3102.048,3104.696,But there is a dispute here as to the forensic evidence.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3106.782,3116.422,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and... and we would... we would simply urge the Court not to adopt a categorical rule that it's inappropriate to look at the State's case."
2005.04-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3116.422,3118.387,What do I do in this case?
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3146.132,3147.295,"Yes, and... and--"
2005.04-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.295,3147.545,Okay.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3162.227,3162.94,--And that's why--
2005.04-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3162.94,3164.775,And so now what do I do with that particularly?
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3167.663,3171.605,--And that's why I would emphasize the trial court's findings in this case.
2005.04-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3171.605,3174.583,The trial court's findings... I read them the way Justice Thomas did.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3174.583,3176.71,It's very clear.
2005.04-1327,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3191.386,3208.385,"On that, could a prosecutor have gotten this case... gotten an indictment against White on the basis that he had four witnesses who put him in the proximity of the crime, four who said that they heard him confess?"
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3214.755,3217.193,--Possibly--
2005.04-1327,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3217.193,3224.083,"And... and also throw in one more thing, the victim's description of the assailant."
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3240.681,3247.232,"--Possibly that evidence would be sufficient to support an indictment, Your Honor, but I don't believe it would be sufficient to support a conviction."
2005.04-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.776,3265.959,"Surely, you're not arguing the third party evidence can only come in if it's proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3269.119,3269.63,No.
2005.04-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.63,3271.945,But you did say it wouldn't be enough to convict.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3271.945,3276.219,"Right, Your Honor, and... and that... that might present a different case."
2005.04-1327,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3276.219,3277.604,I don't--
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3277.604,3279.3,But... but that evidence--
2005.04-1327,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3279.3,3286.912,"--You said it was enough to indict and that very same evidence is put before the jury, but it wouldn't be enough to convict?"
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3286.912,3298.929,"--I'm saying, Your Honor, that the evidence here clearly isn't strong enough to meet the standard for due process, quite apart from whether it's enough to support an indictment or a conviction."
2005.04-1327,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3332.447,3349.64,"Mr. Johnson, your... your citation of the... of the portion of the... of the trial court opinion, which says that there was no corroboration of the... of the confession, that was not stated to... to say, and therefore, the confessions were weak evidence."
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3363.372,3366.091,"No, I... if I may answer."
2005.04-1327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3366.091,3366.641,Please.
2005.04-1327,2,41568,steffen_n_johnson,,3366.641,3367.544,"I understand that, Your Honor."
2005.04-1327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3377.924,3379.702,"Thank you, Mr. Johnson."
2005.04-1327,3,29334,john_h_blume,,3382.63,3384.725,May it please the Court--
2005.04-1327,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.653,3446.731,Does your... your case hinge upon your challenge to the DNA evidence?
2005.04-1327,3,29334,john_h_blume,,3456.772,3457.223,No.
2005.04-1327,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3466.662,3476.913,"Well, why would it be... I mean, if it meets the standard for harmless, it suggests that it didn't make a difference, would not have been likely to make a difference with the jury, and therefore it could have been excluded in the first instance."
2005.04-1327,3,29334,john_h_blume,,3476.913,3477.213,No.
2005.04-1327,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3492.318,3494.092,"Well, isn't that exactly what the rule is designed to prevent?"
2005.04-1327,3,29334,john_h_blume,,3504.575,3505.126,Well--
2005.04-1327,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3505.126,3510.664,"In other words, it gets them off on a detour and distracts their attention from the evidence that is before them."
2005.04-1327,3,29334,john_h_blume,,3510.664,3514.253,"--And the jury might be absolutely right about that, and it's their determination to make."
2005.04-1327,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3540.684,3541.314,"Thank you, counsel."
