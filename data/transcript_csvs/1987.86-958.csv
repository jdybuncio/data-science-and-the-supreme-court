1987.86-958,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We will hear argument next in Number 86-958, Norwest Bank Worthington v. James Ahlers."
1987.86-958,0,25146,gordon_b_conn_jr,,80.368,82.951,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,1592.46,1598.014,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.609,1776.628,It is not a formula proposed by United States District Court.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,1783.182,1789.286,"What is at issue here, Your Honor, is one, the issue here is a narrow one of absolute priority."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.839,1795.572,Are you going to talk about those problems?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,1795.572,1799.659,Am I going to talk about those problems not before the Court?
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.361,1804.511,The problem before the Court.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,1804.511,1817.138,The problem before the Court is whether the absolute priority rule which is set forth in 1129 applies to Mr. Ahlers and Mr. Ahlers and farmers in like circumstances.
1987.86-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.25,1867.304,So Congress really has gotten around to addressing these severe problems?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,1867.304,1870.673,You say Congress has gotten around to addressing the severe problems?
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.407,1897.957,Why is that?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,1899.19,1909.648,"They are too big, and the Courts in Minnesota, Your Honor, have already interpreted Chapter 12 to say that Mr. Ahlers, since he is in Chapter 11 and already filed Chapter 11, could not convert."
1987.86-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.157,1926.092,You mean District Courts in those states?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,1926.092,1932.413,"Bankruptcy Courts, District Courts, have denied the right of farmers like Ahlers to convert to Chapter 12."
1987.86-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.851,2022.819,"Mr. Needles, I am going to ask you a question."
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2050.072,2050.606,Thank you.
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.938,2075.92,He has not given them.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2077.69,2078.473,--He has promised to give them.
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.473,2079.925,Suppose he promised to give money?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2085.293,2101.171,"If Mr. Ahlers confirmed a plan on a promise, Justice Scalia, and one month into the plan he did not delivers on the promise, then Mr. Conn could run into Court under Section 11(12)(B) and the case is dismissed."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.171,2102.055,"So it works for money, too?"
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2102.055,2103.623,It works for anything.
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.623,2108.092,"So it's not just sweat equity, it is even non-sweat equity?"
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2123.502,2135.493,"What we're saying is, in answer to his question, Mr. Conn's question, is how do we protect the creditor if Mr. Ahlers does not perform on his promise of work and the work ethic?"
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.493,2136.179,Right.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2136.179,2144.95,"The answer to that is that the minute he does not perform, the case can be dismissed under the appropriate provisions of the Bankruptcy Code."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.95,2146.367,And the same with a promise to give money.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2146.834,2148.486,And any other promises under a plan.
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.486,2148.936,Okay.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2160.827,2175.503,"What I am saying is that the Los Angeles Lumber Company case indicated that if there were substantial promises that were measurable in money or money's worth, that would be an exception."
1987.86-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.487,2246.516,"Mr. Needler, in Los Angeles Lumber, which I take it you say is still applicable under the Bankruptcy Code, the old business management law, the promise they would continue, they had financial standing in the community."
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2262.858,2268.695,"In Los Angeles Lumber, as I understand what the Court said there is, financial standing in the community is not measurable."
1987.86-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.695,2272.297,And a willingness to continue to work in the business.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2272.297,2292.295,"What I am saying here is with regard to the Ahlers and similar farmers in the United States, for example, if they went in to Fulda, Minnesota, and let us say he got a job managing the thousands of acres that the Land Bank now has, and he collected let us say $40,000 a year and he contributed that back into the Chapter 11, that would be money and money's worth."
1987.86-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2295.413,2300.317,But so were the managers of Los Angeles Lumber measurable.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2300.317,2308.756,"As I read that case, it was negligible things like financial standing in the community, good reputation, those type of things."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.907,2341.91,"He is promising to put it in, that is the problem."
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2361.389,2375.632,"Justice Scalia, as I read the Boyd case, back before the turn of the century, the Court there said they could propose income bonds or they could propose preferred stock."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.86,2802.693,Where is this including language that you are referring to?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2802.693,2821.606,"--In 1129, as it is in 363, as it is in others, in 1129(b)(2) for the purpose of this subsection, the condition that a plan be fair and equitable with respect to a class includes the following requirements."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.606,2825.058,"(e)(2), 1129?"
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2825.058,2829.694,We're talking about 1129(b)(2)(B).
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.694,2830.712,(b)(2).
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2832.762,2842.603,"By the use of the word ""includes"", Congress has said this is not the exclusive rule."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.113,2866.552,"It says it includes the following requirements, one of which is the requirement that you assert need not be observed here."
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2877.443,2889.834,"With respect to a class of unsecured claims, the plan provides each holder of a class to receive or retain on account of such claim property of value as of the effective date of the plan, equal to the allowed amount of the claim."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2891.417,2895.404,"But it includes that requirement, is what the statute says."
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2895.404,2896.021,That is correct.
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2896.021,2897.538,That requirement is included.
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,2897.538,2903.158,"Or, the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.132,3199.851,Have the rates that the land banks charge for new loans gone up?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,3199.851,3206.606,"To my knowledge, I don't know of anybody making new loans, but those loans which they have made have gone down."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.058,3218.597,Don't you think they will be more careful about making new loans if we adopt the position that you are urging us to adopt?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,3218.597,3223.799,Would they be more careful about making new loans?
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3223.799,3225.017,Or do you believe in a free lunch?
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,3225.017,3226.951,"I do not believe in a free lunch, sir."
1987.86-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.951,3243.295,"Is it in the interest of the farmer to have a security system, including a bankruptcy system, that gives people who are contemplating lending money enough security that they will be willing to lend the money at a reasonable rate?"
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,3250.566,3259.155,"There is no question that the lending practices in this country that led up to this disastrous period in the 1970s and 1980s, I am sure that the lenders are not going to repeat."
1987.86-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.68,3305.536,"But these banks, you say, loaned on asset value and they should have taken into consideration income."
1987.86-958,1,45739,william_l_needler,,3315.658,3318.76,"What we are saying, Justice White, is that we will pay them back the asset value."
1987.86-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.818,3361.103,"Thank you, Mr. Needler."
1987.86-958,2,25146,gordon_b_conn_jr,,3363.455,3366.174,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-958,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3486.234,3487.917,Would you have to convince all of them?
1987.86-958,2,25146,gordon_b_conn_jr,,3487.917,3490.536,"It goes by class, Your Honor."
1987.86-958,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3490.536,3492.804,A majority of each class?
1987.86-958,2,25146,gordon_b_conn_jr,,3492.804,3498.374,"I believe it is two thirds in dollars and a majority in number, within each class."
1987.86-958,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3532.696,3533.779,"Thank you, Mr. Conn."
