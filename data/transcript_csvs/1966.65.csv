1966.65,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.185,"No. 65, Robert D. Watkins, appellant versus J.F. Conway."
1966.65,0,46460,william_g_vance,,33.439,36.959,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1966.65,1,36349,martin_mcfarland,,1658.652,1661.859,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1950.326,1960.795,"Mr. McFarland, do you know whether the 10-year statute was on the books in Georgia at the time M'Elmoyle was decided in 1839?"
1966.65,1,36349,martin_mcfarland,,1960.795,1973.273,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I can't positively say but I would -- my best judgment leads me to believe that it is tremendously old statute."
1966.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1973.273,1974.378,Just like the five-year old?
1966.65,1,36349,martin_mcfarland,,1974.378,1976.525,"Yes, just like the five years."
1966.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2175.978,2178.349,"In the scire facias, is that an administrative proceeding?"
1966.65,1,36349,martin_mcfarland,,2180.157,2183.029,"It is not an irrational proceeding, Mr. Justice Brennan --"
1966.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2183.029,2184.467,Is it an adverary proceeding?
1966.65,1,36349,martin_mcfarland,,2184.467,2186.423,"Yes, it's an ancillary proceeding."
1966.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2186.423,2188.018,"No, is it an adversary proceeding?"
1966.65,1,36349,martin_mcfarland,,2188.018,2188.153,Oh!
1966.65,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2198.426,2202.448,"Well, what kind of defense from the defendant?"
1966.65,1,36349,martin_mcfarland,,2202.448,2212.007,I would assume that technically it would be such defenses that would be only as to a judgment such as fraud in his procurement and things of those natures.
1966.65,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2435.42,2437.985,Mr. Vance?
1966.65,2,46460,william_g_vance,,2437.985,2449.402,"I'd like to first point out, Your Honors, that all the cases cited by the appellee in his brief and in the argument do not involve cases where any discrimination was alleged."
1966.65,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2474.631,2488.81,"Mr. M'Elmoyle I notice from your adversary brief that apparently, this 10-year statute was a section in the Act of 1823 CAB 498, is that be right?"
1966.65,3,36349,martin_mcfarland,,2488.81,2492.721,"Yes, Your Honor but under the M'Elmoyle case, I believe â€“"
1966.65,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2492.721,2497.23,"But at the time M'Elmoyle was decided then, both the statutes were --"
1966.65,4,46460,william_g_vance,,2497.23,2499.308,"Well, it's even worse than that as far as it goes."
1966.65,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2507.414,2509.009,-- that is presumption of payment?
1966.65,4,46460,william_g_vance,,2509.009,2509.899,That's correct.
1966.65,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2517.056,2526.192,"Well, obviously the Equal Protection question could not have been raised because Fourteenth Amendment didn't come on the books till 30 years later?"
1966.65,4,46460,william_g_vance,,2526.192,2544.243,"That's correct, Your Honor, but even though this was recognized, if you look at the argument of counsel in the -- prior to the opinion it's clear that this point was not argued and that really was not considered in that context by the Court as being an argument to vitiate the statute."
1966.65,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2544.845,2554.414,"Well, of course, Metcalf folded extensively from M'Elmoyle and Metcalf was decided in this Court in 1893; that was after the Fourteenth Amendment."
1966.65,4,46460,william_g_vance,,2562.325,2580.575,"Well, Your Honor, if you read the Metcalf opinion, you will note that that was dealing with federal judgments (voice overlap) out-of-state judgment and the Court felt constrained to overrule a prior Wisconsin Supreme Court case interpreting its own statute so there would be no discrimination between the period of time for federal judgment as opposed to --"
1966.65,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2580.575,2586.713,"Well, there was the federal judgment in Georgia versus a Georgia judgment, that's really what it was?"
1966.65,4,46460,william_g_vance,,2586.713,2587.136,"Yes, sir."
1966.65,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2644.283,2645.286,Very well.
