1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.057,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 90-5538, Zakhar Melkonyan v. Louis W. Sullivan."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,11.66,15.501,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.952,291.332,"Mr. Wolfman, I think I agree with you that normally that's, that's the way we would interpret words like that, but we have already interpreted other words in d(1)A in a way that's a little unusual."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,329.727,334.599,"Well, you're referring, of course, to the Sullivan v. Hudson case."
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.599,334.949,That's right.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,334.949,348.407,"In that case the Court said that if there is existing a pending civil action, that administrative decisions on remand can be considered part of that civil action if they have a very intimate relationship with the remand."
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.066,363.488,But they do consider them part of the civil action.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,363.488,370.383,--Those particular type of narrow... the narrow exception for a particular type of proceedings which are intimately related to the civil action.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.383,370.804,Right.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,384.351,394.369,"I would submit, Justice Scalia, that they are two entirely different phrases, and I don't... when we get to the practical considerations, which I would be glad to address, there is no reason to expand that."
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.224,430.853,"Mr. Wolfman, if you read further on in the language you're construing, where it says a judgment is final and not appealable, I get the sense Congress was not using terms of art here."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,434.864,460.152,"Well, in this particular case that was a response in the 1985 amendments to the law which, after a district court, for instance, issued a judgment, Congress felt it was best not to force the applicant to file a fee petition while the Government could still appeal to the court of appeals, for the purposes of efficiency, to have everything complete in the district court, and then allow the period to run."
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.636,471.699,"Well, so Congress meant by saying not appealable that the time for appeal must have run?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,471.699,472.829,That is correct.
1990.90-5538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,539.083,561.539,"Mr. Wolfman, in circumstances such as we have in this case, where your client obtained the relief sought and where the Government is precluded from filing any appeal, who is it that's going to go back to the district court and get a judgment, do you suppose?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,561.539,563.6,It could be either party.
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.155,587.056,What kind of a judgment does the court enter?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,587.056,587.556,--Well--
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.556,590.028,What does it say?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,590.028,592.079,"--Frequently... excuse me, I'm sorry."
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.079,593.35,"Well, what does it say?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,593.35,598.893,Frequently it will simply dismiss the action or affirm the final decision of the appeals counsel.
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.859,610.581,Here your client won before the Secretary.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,610.581,611.933,That is correct.
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.684,615.525,And there was nothing else going on in the administrative agency?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,615.525,618.845,"Well, that is true, but that is a determination that we make in hindsight."
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.845,619.987,"Yes, yes."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,632.045,634.477,That is indeed the Secretary's practice by and large.
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.225,793.942,Could you have filed a petition for fees when the court entered... within 30 days after the court entered its remand?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,793.942,796.265,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.565,814.765,"You mean it hadn't finally prevailed, but it, you had prevailed in the court."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,814.765,815.396,--That's correct.
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.248,817.918,And that was certainly a final judgment then.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,817.918,821.621,"--Well, what there was was a remand at... in fact--"
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.621,822.843,"Well, it was still a final judgment."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,822.843,828.276,"--It was a judgment, and it was at the behest of the Secretary and it was remanded."
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,941.878,945.461,What if the Secretary doesn't get it?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,951.215,954.608,"Absolutely not, I think, and there is two reasons for that."
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,961.613,969.838,"Yes, but if the Secretary doesn't get it, then your client would have to get it in order to be able to move for attorneys' fees?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,969.838,971.371,"No, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1012.658,1018.101,"Well, the statute says a party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall within 30 days of final judgment."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1027.316,1028.195,That is correct.
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.868,1061.01,"Well, what does the language"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1064.383,1072.097,--That means that after the final judgment of the district court in the case that the applicant has 30 days in which to file a fee petition.
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1082.464,1085.747,"Well, but the statute seems to address it in a different way, at least it seems to me."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1096.273,1099.586,"We respectfully disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.586,1101.466,"Well, how do you read that language?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1108.372,1117.228,"That language, Your Honor, sets the outmost time in which someone could file a fee application if there exists a final judgment."
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.215,1151.148,"Well, you could, on your theory you could wait, you could wait a couple of years after you prevail, I don't suppose you would because you want your money, but you could wait a year and never have a final judgment, and anytime you wanted to you could just file for fees?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1153.692,1158.463,"--Well, our position is that, but that occurs only if the Secretary allows it to--"
1990.90-5538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.463,1167.149,I would suppose the requirement for being relatively prompt at filing fees indicates that there should in all cases be some sort of a deadline.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1167.149,1175.064,--And that I think is precisely why the Secretary is telling every claimant around the Nation that he will make post-remand filings and get an order.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.176,1203.324,"Mr. Wolfman, you talk as though the position you're arguing applies only in Social Security cases, and you say it's the practice of the Secretary to file these things automatically."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1227.47,1230.61,"That is right, but I think there is an answer to that."
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.694,1258.729,"You're talking about the equivalent in the Social Security context of a 405(g) sentence 6 remand, correct?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1258.729,1259.851,"That is correct, although it may--"
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.851,1260.96,Which do you consider this?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1261.982,1262.302,"--Yes, it is."
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.302,1263.462,--or sentence 4?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1263.462,1264.193,This is a sentence 6.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.045,1274.481,"Well, you should have been making a different argument then, because under a sentence 6 remand you have to come back to the court."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1274.481,1276.221,"I absolutely agree, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.317,1286.008,No problem there.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1300.147,1305.149,"--That is correct, and perhaps... our view is that that is not a major problem."
1990.90-5538,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1332.597,1339.493,And do I understand you to say this is in your view a sentence 6 remand case here?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1339.493,1340.902,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is."
1990.90-5538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1364.568,1380.049,"Under your theory of the statute that the 30-day final judgment rule is simply an outside limit, would a prevailing party be entitled to make multiple applications for fees?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1380.049,1385.312,"At what point, Your Honor?"
1990.90-5538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1385.883,1396.228,"Well, I thought you told the... your answer to the Chief Justice was that the 30 days was just an outer limit, and that you could make application for fees at any time before that?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1396.228,1397.009,--Well--
1990.90-5538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.009,1410.897,"And if you're prevailing as to part of the action, can you then apply for fees as to that part, and then come back and apply for more fees when the final determination is made by the agency?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1410.897,1413.639,--Indeed I think that's... that is a possibility.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.637,1469.188,Excuse me.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1474.193,1475.913,--It was not before the answer.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.913,1477.894,"Well, then how can it be a section 6 remand?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1477.894,1482.448,Sentence 6 has two categories of remands.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.791,1486.78,I see.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1493.214,1495.144,"The court did not order, but that was the substance of what occurred."
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.875,1499.158,"Well, but... it's the substance... there are two parts to sentence 6."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1510.355,1511.456,--That is correct.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.456,1516.378,The second part is it may at any time order additional evidence to be taken.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1518.87,1520.362,Did the court order additional evidence?
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.362,1520.682,Right.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1520.682,1522.683,"Not in the words of its remand order, no."
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1522.683,1527.057,"Well, then neither the first part nor the second part of sentence 6 seems to apply."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1527.057,1535.902,"I respectfully disagree with that, Justice Scalia, and the reason is that in substance what had occurred is that the Secretary learned of new evidence."
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1541.316,1547.13,"Before answer, if you intend to be under section 6... sentence 6."
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1547.13,1547.41,No.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.605,1556.176,I see.
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1556.176,1562.22,And the fact is that is not necessarily perfectly recited in every remand order.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.021,1591.188,"You think the Secretary would have been in contempt of court if he had not taken additional evidence in this case, if he had just reconsidered the case on the basis of the same evidence?"
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1593.279,1593.739,Yes.
1990.90-5538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.991,1597.012,But you think he had to?
1990.90-5538,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1604.526,1604.817,Yes.
1990.90-5538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1691.594,1695.267,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfman."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1697.378,1704.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.618,1821.82,"Is this a relatively new position of the Secretary, or--"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1821.82,1824.051,"--It is a relatively new position, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.051,1824.812,--Like real new?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1824.812,1826.895,"Well, the... yes."
1990.90-5538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.72,1855.433,Is the Secretary's present position based at least in part on those two decisions?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1855.433,1861.977,It is based on those two decisions in that we believe that they greatly clarify the issue and support it.
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.581,1870.272,You do?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1873.685,1876.106,"It would be a more difficult argument, Your Honor, but--"
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.578,1917.053,"Mr. Sloan, you talk about the administrative difficulty of accepting the petitioner's position, but what about the administrative difficulty of accepting yours?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1955.408,1957.261,"I would make two points in response to that, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.533,2061.888,"I guess under petitioner's scheme, he's going to have to decide when there is a final judgment in the agency as well."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2067.982,2070.606,"Well, I would think so, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.234,2086.054,"Well, he could go back too late, but he can't go back too early."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2097.902,2100.605,--That enables him to go back as a prevailing party.
1990.90-5538,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2101.555,2123.01,"Mr. Sloan, as your exchange with Justice Scalia illustrates, at least if it was necessary to get a judgment from the district court, everyone would then know what triggers the time limit, I suppose."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2123.01,2125.802,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2125.802,2129.735,That would be the positive side of that interpretation.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2144.193,2147.556,"Well, there are--"
1990.90-5538,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2147.556,2156.161,The petitioner's attorney referred to some form and some rather uniform practice that the Secretary... has that been the Secretary's practice generally?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2156.161,2162.266,"--It has been the general view that filings are appropriate, not necessarily getting additional orders."
1990.90-5538,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2180.475,2182.148,That what has been the general view?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2182.148,2184.449,--That there would be filings in the district court.
1990.90-5538,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2184.449,2185.811,A filing of what?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2185.811,2191.264,"Of the transcript and the decision on remand, that the--"
1990.90-5538,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2191.264,2195.836,And a request for an order of dismissal or something of the sort?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2195.836,2197.309,--Sometimes.
1990.90-5538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.588,2218.272,"Can't you answer the question more definitively, Mr. Sloan?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2218.272,2223.335,"--Well, I'm sorry, Chief Justice, it's just that it's been a complicated area."
1990.90-5538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.335,2225.256,"Well, but the question calls for a fairly simple answer, I think."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2225.256,2225.907,Okay.
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.503,2239.166,"Well, why did he ever file anything, then?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2239.166,2242.847,"--Well, because there was a lot of confusion on this issue, frankly, Justice White."
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.552,2255.165,Why is... why is this such a big issue?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2269.136,2275.328,A final judgment of a court is not necessary for a claimant to file for fees.
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.699,2283.105,"So the claimant could... if you didn't go to court and get an order, the claimant can just wait around and file for fees whenever he wants to?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2283.105,2286.367,"--Under his view, and we think that's a flaw in his view."
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.769,2298.753,"Well, let's assume that we don't buy your notion that the Secretary's final order is a final judgment."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2308.661,2315.396,"--No, we would think that in that circumstance it would be appropriate to get something that--"
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.396,2322.168,"Appropriate, but suppose he doesn't get a judgment and neither do you, but he files for fees."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2323.119,2326.562,"--Well, the logic of petitioner's position is that it would be proper under his view."
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.142,2374.314,I kind of... I sort of wonder why the case is even here.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2394.45,2396.052,The problem with that--
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.052,2398.624,Why is it such a big bother for the Secretary?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2398.624,2404.527,--Because the 30-day time limitation is a central part of the Equal Access to Justice Act.
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.52,2429.893,"Well, you can... if that really worries you, you can go and start the clock running just by filing your piece of paper and asking for an order."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2429.893,2446.795,"Well, first of all the structure of the act puts the burden on the applicant for fees to go to court, and that gets to the other half of petitioner's argument, that if they want an attorney fee... if the Government wants an attorney fee time limitation, the Government can simply go to court and seek some kind of order."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.512,2474.363,"What would require, Mr. Sloan?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2482.86,2484.73,"--No provision of law, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.152,2491.765,You have to persuade some district court to enter an order.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2491.765,2492.133,To issue an order.
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.133,2494.757,Suppose I'm a district judge and I say I don't want to be bothered with these things.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2496.497,2497.068,That's--
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.068,2498.899,I entered judgment and the case is gone.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2505.073,2506.495,"--No, there is not."
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.191,2519.462,"Well, but Mr. Sloan, is it correct there is no provision of law that requires an order?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2552.294,2555.937,One would ordinarily expect the district court to act on that motion.
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.937,2558.007,"But he'd have a legal duty to do so, would he not?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2558.007,2560.34,"I would think that he would, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.34,2561.019,Couldn't he deny the motion?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2570.565,2571.096,Yes.
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.221,2612.503,"Oh, but that can't be right, Mr. Sloan."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2620.24,2622.661,"Well, no--"
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.661,2626.232,"He doesn't know at that point the Secretary is going to give the award, does he?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2627.343,2628.963,"--No, the judge does not."
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.963,2633.598,So he can't by those all further proceedings mean he is precluding any further review by him or her.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2633.598,2643.622,"No, it doesn't mean that he is precluding, but it does mean that a party that is not satisfied with the result would have to come back."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.905,2661.975,Would that be a new action when he came back or the same action?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2673.414,2673.784,"Well, as to--"
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.784,2675.506,--forever until it's closed?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2681.967,2684.839,"--Well, it's a new piece of litigation."
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2694.937,2697.829,"Well, the form that you use seems to contemplate using the same number."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2709.106,2714.64,"--Well, this is... I was trying to elaborate on the problems with saying whether normally or not, and--"
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.64,2719.204,I think it would be most unlikely for him to give it a new number in the district court when this case comes back.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2719.204,2720.784,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2751.205,2751.666,"How about under other statutes, Mr. Sloan?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2758.261,2760.632,To go back to the district court?
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.632,2761.323,Right.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2761.323,2763.754,I am not aware of such a practice.
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2765.096,2767.265,To your knowledge the practice is not to go back?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2767.265,2768.525,That's right.
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.311,2794.963,Is it also... not also true that a very high percentage of EAJA applications are in Social Security Act cases?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2794.963,2795.934,--That's correct.
1990.90-5538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2797.116,2813.625,"You rely on Sullivan v. Hudson, and there we said the procedure set forth in 42 U.S.C. 405(g) contemplates additional action both by the Secretary and the district court before civil action is concluded following a remand."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2818.909,2831.238,"Well, we believe that it is inapplicable to this case because, as the Court clarified in Finkelstein, that would apply in a sentence 6 remand, and we believe this was not a sentence 6 remand."
1990.90-5538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2842.285,2845.737,Is this under 405(g) at all?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2845.737,2846.769,"Yes, it is."
1990.90-5538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2858.905,2864.249,"Well, under your view what statutory authority did the court act under when it remanded the case?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2864.249,2869.101,It acted under an implied authority as part of 405(g).
1990.90-5538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2872.384,2875.346,So then it's a little odd to say it's a 405(g) action.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2880.799,2886.522,"--Well, one could view it that way, or also as an incident to the grant of authority in 405(g) itself."
1990.90-5538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2886.522,2891.026,"So then our observation in Sullivan v. Hudson was, at the least, incomplete?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2891.026,2897.591,"Well, as the Court clarified in Finkelstein, it should be read as being limited to sentence 6 remands."
1990.90-5538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2897.591,2899.672,So the case you rely on is incomplete?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2899.672,2906.137,"Well, we are relying on Hudson and Finkelstein taken together, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2906.137,2908.358,At least you want us to complete it?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2921.488,2923.528,"We do take that position, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2924.209,2935.356,"So we're only talking here about what, sentence 4 remands and this other vague implied remand that you say exists under the statute?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2935.356,2936.646,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2995.985,3004.691,"There are other statutes that have the equivalent of section 6 remands in them that specifically authorize the court to remand to the agency for the taking of further evidence, aren't there?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3004.691,3005.772,"Yes, there are."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3005.772,3012.086,And do you think an agency has authority to do that even apart from an explicit provision in the statute?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3016.169,3019.42,To go to the district court or the court of appeals and ask for a remand based--
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.42,3019.81,"No, no, no."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3027.256,3029.547,--It could send it back for the taking of additional evidence.
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.547,3031.377,"--They do that sometimes, even without explicit authority, don't they?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3031.377,3031.938,Yes.
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.88,3038.923,And you would treat that the same way you would treat a sentence 6 under the Social Security Act?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3038.923,3046.808,"If it was pursuant to a provision that explicitly required coming back to the court for further proceedings, yes, we would."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.808,3047.83,Suppose it was unclear--
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3048.929,3049.62,Or of the court's order.
1990.90-5538,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3050.792,3052.21,Suppose it were unclear.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3052.21,3059.877,"Well, we would urge in those other contexts as well that there should be a plain statement rule in terms of remands."
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.381,3192.434,"Mr. Sloan, can I ask you this question about the sequence in this case?"
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3204.191,3204.922,Correct.
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.922,3208.383,And then subsequently he got a check for his back award.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3216.259,3222.563,"Yes, there is, but we would not think that that keeps open the action on the merits."
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3248.821,3253.445,So the clock would start to run from the time that the appeals counsel announced that they agree the man is disabled?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3253.445,3258.137,"Well, it, in our view, Your Honor... that was the view that the court of appeals took."
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3258.137,3264.241,I don't mean to... the calculation of the time when the clock would start to run would have that as its initial reference point?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3264.241,3264.742,Right.
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.334,3284.814,Right.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3293.559,3298.885,"Well, it would certainly be appropriate to have regulations on that."
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.599,3304.889,I understand that.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3304.889,3309.181,"--But, were you referring specifically to a regulation directed to EAJA?"
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3309.181,3310.033,Yeah.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3322.929,3335.708,"Well, it would certainly be appropriate to have the administrative documents be as clear as possible on that so that everybody knows what the applicable rule is."
1990.90-5538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3345.425,3345.676,Right.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3352.02,3356.673,"That... and to the extent that it's not, administrative clarification would be appropriate."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3356.673,3372.861,"Mr. Sloan, lest silence be deemed consent, don't associate me with your suggestion that in a sentence 6 case the Secretary can avoid going back by simply saying something to the district court."
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3377.756,3383.372,"Your Honor, I was not saying at all that the mere fact that the Secretary says something means he won't come back."
1990.90-5538,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.762,3407.725,In the face of the statute which says that he has to come back with the... with a new order.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3409.207,3410.599,--Okay.
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.599,3415.692,--Are you... is the Government defending the Ninth Circuit decision--
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3415.692,3416.772,Yes.
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.694,3418.815,--and the reasoning?
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3418.815,3421.146,--We're defending the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
1990.90-5538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.672,3432.944,And it was not appealable.
1990.90-5538,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3432.944,3433.625,That's right.
1990.90-5538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.386,3439.339,"Thank you, Mr. Sloan."
1990.90-5538,2,18166,brian_wolfman,,3442.768,3444.461,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1990.90-5538,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3470.648,3474.682,"Yes, but it may be true that the U.S. Attorney's position has been different in different cities."
1990.90-5538,2,18166,brian_wolfman,,3478.293,3479.985,--That is not my experience.
1990.90-5538,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3503.92,3505.072,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfman."
