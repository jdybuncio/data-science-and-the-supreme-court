2010.09-907,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.539,"We'll hear argument first this term in Case 09-907, Ransom v. FIA Card Services."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,11.689,15.026,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,105.4,106.935,Why is that the crux of it?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,110.637,111.487,Yes.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,111.487,121.529,And were the -- was the commentary in the Collection Financial Standards in existence at the time when Congress enacted this provision?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,121.529,134.087,"There was a Collection Financial Analysis that was in place, and it was noted in 1998 as a prior version of the bill that ultimately wasn't passed."
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,134.087,139.789,And that explains what the IRS understands the local standards to mean; isn't that right?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,139.789,141.824,I would disagree with that.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,154.833,161.904,"Well, I understand that, but Congress decided to make reference to the local standards in this bankruptcy provision, didn't it?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,161.904,162.987,--Standards.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,162.987,163.606,Yes.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,163.606,164.489,It didn't go beyond that.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,164.489,173.462,"And this -- and at the time when it did that, there was official IRS commentary regarding the meaning of those standards, correct?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,173.462,175.83,For the IRS to use in collecting taxes.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,175.83,186.352,"And your argument is that Congress intended to adopt the standards promulgated by the IRS, but not the IRS's interpretation of the standards."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,186.352,188.737,"Correct, not their methodology or interpretation."
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.737,194.391,"Doesn't the chart say ""ownership costs""?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,194.391,196.243,Yes.
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.243,202.647,And you would read that to mean non-costs as well?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,217.491,223.228,Because we have to look at it as a standard aggregate.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.366,266.321,"Mr. Burke, isn't it the -- isn't it the case that, even on the other side's interpretation of it, it doesn't come down to actual costs anyway?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,275.26,277.212,"That's their position, or even $1."
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.212,281.683,"Even one payment of $1, you get the entire deduction."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,293.907,297.443,"Again, I would perhaps--"
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.443,298.793,"I'm trying to help you, Mr. Burke."
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,298.793,318.622,"Mr. Burke, before you respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that cost is no longer being incurred?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,318.622,322.408,--The cost has never been incurred.
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,323.926,342.888,"My question is: In the situation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not automatic that this $471 gets deducted because there could be proposed an amendment of the claim to reflect that that -- there is no longer any expense for ownership."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,342.888,346.791,"--In the situation where there is a dollar, of course, an amendment can be made."
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.793,361.385,"But it isn't -- it isn't automatic that because there's one payment, then forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the $471."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,361.385,362.318,--That's what the lower court said.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.318,363.401,Excuse me.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,369.805,373.193,Under the tax law you get a standard deduction.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.193,373.609,A standard--
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,373.609,374.326,No different than here.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.395,377.861,--Right.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,397.474,399.074,"No, that is not what I think is the law."
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,454.061,454.527,You do.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,476.89,477.926,Correct.
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.926,480.026,And it defines those as $471.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,480.026,480.544,Correct.
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.544,485.912,"And then on 3a, where it says what ownership costs are, it says"
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.149,522.165,"Yes, I was."
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,522.165,532.438,"And -- and how do you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear language which says what these standards refer to?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,532.438,535.79,Because the standards refer to the numbers.
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,537.059,543.228,"Yes, but it doesn't -- for example, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month and they cost you $48 extra."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,549.399,551.834,What -- what--
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,551.834,555.036,"I mean, ownership costs refers to lease and loan payments."
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.003,558.738,"What's the language we are dealing with, Mr. Burke?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,565.376,577.45,"--What the statute says is the applicable -- you shall get, mandatory, the applicable amounts specified based on where the debtor resides."
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.45,577.986,Wait.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,581.103,583.639,In the national local standards.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.639,586.055,"Read the text of the statute, would you, please, for me?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,597.744,605.033,"""The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amount specified under the national local standards. """
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.033,608.219,"""Amount specified under"" the standard."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,608.219,613.039,"Specific amount, ""applicable modified amount specified""."
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.039,617.325,"""Applicable amount specified"", not the ""amount specified if applicable""."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,617.325,621.193,"Correct, based on where a debtor resides."
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,637.088,642.142,"Look at the local standard, which is on page 8 of the appendix to your brief, right?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,649.629,650.446,--Yes.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,650.446,652.764,What if a person leases a car?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,654.95,661.37,"Yes, because they get the cost whether they owe on it or not."
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,661.37,666.84,"But they don't own the car, so how can they get ownership costs?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,666.84,668.792,There's a different definition.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,674.144,675.613,"Where do you get that, from the--"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,675.613,676.196,--From the--
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,676.196,679.148,--The Collection Financial Standards?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,679.148,686.135,--The Collection Financial Standards say you get the lease -- you get the deduction if you have a loan or a lease payment.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,686.135,690.289,Where do you get the definition that somebody who leases something owns it?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,690.289,691.523,I don't.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,692.825,694.908,Then how do they get ownership costs?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,694.908,696.277,Because you have possession of it.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,702.597,705.299,"If somebody rents an apartment, do they own the apartment?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,705.299,712.286,"Probably under ownership, their possession is some type of an ownership, maybe just possessory."
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.286,715.404,Is there something wrong with the IRS saying what they mean?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,722.508,723.108,The problem--
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,723.108,723.824,--That's what it says it means.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,728.378,731.08,"--No, for collection of taxes there is not."
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.006,751.558,Why not -- it says you are suppose to look at the costs; it's ownership costs.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,765.218,768.52,There is no reason to limit it.
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.917,791.702,I don't follow that.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,802.39,805.509,"--To collect taxes, that's how they defined it."
2010.09-907,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,830.744,832.66,"Mr. Burke, if we could stay with this."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,871.321,876.789,--Because to reach that you have to go into the Internal Revenue Manual.
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,987.391,1002.25,"Mr. Burke, the -- it's unusual to allow a deduction for the purpose of calculating disposable income although you don't have any expense."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1023.933,1030.604,--If the Court understands my view that Congress gave--
2010.09-907,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1030.604,1031.237,No.
2010.09-907,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1051.267,1058.171,"For example, Mr. Burke, what would happen if you didn't actually have any out-of-pocket medical costs?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1062.308,1068.379,"--I'm saying you get all the deductions, whether you owe on it or not."
2010.09-907,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1075.149,1077.985,Is that the general view of the courts?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1083.388,1085.59,--There is about 60 published cases.
2010.09-907,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.606,1090.125,"In other words, even on this point they are split?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1090.125,1095.696,--This is one line that they have looked at in the cases.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.481,1100.198,I don't understand what you are saying.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1106.052,1108.504,"--Yes, they're split about 50-50."
2010.09-907,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1108.504,1122.013,"Do they apply -- do the Courts apply the housing and utilities listed amount whether or not you pay for a house or not, whether or not you rent?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1122.013,1125.048,There's two published cases I'm aware of and both allowed it.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1142.777,1148.164,"Of course, once again, Mr. Burke, this is -- I don't know why you don't point this out."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1171.862,1172.562,That's correct.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.562,1173.412,So.
2010.09-907,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1173.412,1178.016,"My question, incidentally, about courts was not with reference to the car expense."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1201.048,1203.667,I apologize for not understanding it.
2010.09-907,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1211.671,1215.023,And they get it whether or not they incur that expense or not?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1215.023,1215.475,Correct.
2010.09-907,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1215.475,1222.895,"In other words, food, you don't have to say, well, he did spend this much money on food, so he gets the same deduction?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1222.895,1223.445,Correct.
2010.09-907,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1223.445,1226.414,"If he doesn't eat as much as somebody else he gets the same deduction, right?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1226.414,1226.831,Right.
2010.09-907,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1229.033,1238.905,"But, Mr. Burke, even you would say -- is this correct -- that if you don't own a car at all you can't claim the car costs?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1238.905,1240.591,Yes.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.591,1248.529,Is that -- is that by reason of the Internal Revenue Service--
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1248.529,1249.646,No.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.646,1252.914,--manual or is it by reason of the Bankruptcy Code itself?
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1252.914,1267.138,"It's by reason of the Bankruptcy Code that refers to the standards and the standards specifically say, you have one car, no cars and you get a public transportation, or two cars; pick the one."
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.138,1268.59,So it's in the chart--
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1268.59,1269.54,It's in the chart.
2010.09-907,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.54,1270.14,--that you claim -- okay.
2010.09-907,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1270.14,1275.91,What if you own a car but it's completely inoperable and it has no value.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1284.449,1288.503,"Based on a strict reading of the code, you get it."
2010.09-907,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.911,1327.878,"And would your answer be the same if the allowance was set, the decree was made, and the debtor then went out and bought the junker to put in his driveway just in order to get the 400-plus dollars a month, or would that be deemed an evasion of the law that could be addressed by the Bankruptcy Court?"
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1327.878,1330.83,"It can addressed by the Bankruptcy Court, and that's the beauty of the statute."
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.322,1348.059,What is -- we've got about half the courts in the country agreeing with you.
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1386.851,1387.567,--Because--
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1387.567,1392.071,"Now, the argument is, well, that's what they mean by it, so that's what applicable."
2010.09-907,0,18440,christopher_p_burke,,1411.282,1415.901,"--The means test is a form, and if you look at the form -- the means test is a form."
2010.09-907,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1415.901,1416.869,I've looked at the form.

2010.09-907,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1941.436,1952.16,"So what you would have the statute read is: The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amount specified, as a -- as a maximum."
2010.09-907,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1955.529,1968.853,"No, Your Honor, because the amount under the national standards as the national standards operate is the -- is an allowance, not an actual, and the amount under the local standards as they operate is the amount actually spent or the amount in the table, whichever is less."

2010.09-907,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.905,2851.905,It's not applicable.
2010.09-907,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2860.676,2869.43,I think that it would further Congress's purposes to say that you have to -- that you look to the actual costs that the debtor has.

2010.09-907,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3085.3,3090.086,"Well, certainly the Bankruptcy Court doesn't scrutinize, you know, what happens to that regard."
2010.09-907,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3131.496,3140.351,"Ms. Saharsky, could you explain to me the Government's position on when a debtor with loan and lease payments gets to deduct them under Romanette II?"
2010.09-907,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3151.64,3153.925,"It does not have that affect, Your Honor."
2010.09-907,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3201.056,3208.377,"But, in other words, the loan and lease payments don't count as debt for purposes of the notwithstanding clause, they count as expense amounts?"
2010.09-907,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3208.377,3212.614,"We say that those are expense amounts that are specified, they're not payments for debts."

2010.09-907,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.662,3316.348,As opposed to it would be $600 some if you didn't count the $471?
2010.09-907,3,18440,christopher_p_burke,,3316.348,3316.948,Correct.
2010.09-907,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3316.948,3326.871,"Even though the disposable income figure was $210, the debtor was willing -- the debtor proposed paying $500."
2010.09-907,3,18440,christopher_p_burke,,3344.083,3348.67,This is exactly why our view of the law works.

2010.09-907,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3481.055,3491.261,Do you think that the Bankruptcy Code provision freezes the national and local standards to some degree or completely as they existed at the time when the statute was enacted?
2010.09-907,3,18440,christopher_p_burke,,3491.261,3496.981,"At the time the debtor files, those numbers are frozen."
