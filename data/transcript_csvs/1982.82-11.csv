1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.858,We'll hear argument next in Mennonite Board of Missions versus Adams.
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,64.037,68.222,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,174.274,175.57,Does the record show why?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,175.57,181.412,"No, it does not, Justice Blackmun, as to why she did not pay the taxes."
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.298,283.557,"Mr. Cohen, is there any provision of Indiana law that assures that by inspecting the record of the mortgage, the place at which it has been recorded, whichever, a person would be able to apprise themselves of the present address of the mortgagee as well as the name of the mortgagee?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,283.557,289.305,The mortgage was filed in the county records in Goshen.
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.846,311.811,"You're advocating a principle of request, sending mailed notice to any mortgagee of records, I take it."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,322.182,334.334,"--Justice Rehnquist, if the mortgage was not recorded, I do not believe that the county auditor would be forced to search titles and give notice to anybody."
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.645,338.192,"No, but--"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,346.3,363.713,"That is a question that is not applicable to this case, but that would be something that would be a fact question that would possibly relieve the county auditor from sending notice... actual notice."
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,378.192,387.095,"Would he be entitled to treat the mortgage... the address shown on the mortgage as the last known address even if it turned out, in fact, to be the third last known address?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,387.095,396.857,"--Yes, I believe he would unless the county auditor knew that the mortgagor... or rather the mortgagee had actually moved."
1982.82-11,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.147,418.613,Does the record show the contents of the notice that was published in this case?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,418.613,420.535,"No, it does not, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-11,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,431.108,434.873,What is in... what is contained in that published form of notice?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,434.873,450.381,"--Under Indiana law, the statutes provide that the name of the owner of the property will be listed, an address, if possible, but it does not require a specific street address."
1982.82-11,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.348,457.566,And the mortgagee's name or not?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,457.566,468.483,--There is no present... there is no requirement under the Indiana law in effect at the time this case arose to send mailed notice at all to a mortgagee.
1982.82-11,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.389,473.295,"Yes, but I'm just asking about the published notice, what it contained."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,473.295,473.732,--Okay.
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,607.723,609.285,Just a question of procedure.
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,622.796,624.904,"He does, Justice Blackmun."
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,660.094,665.154,"Anyway, he'd have to go in and get his title cleared up?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,665.154,665.951,"--Yes, but--"
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,665.951,668.09,And this is when your people got the notice.
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,668.09,673.244,--That was the first time they actually learned that the property had been sold for taxes.
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,673.963,676.852,What does an ordinary bank mortgagee do in Indiana?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,676.852,684.645,"--Well, Justice Blackmun, I'm not really sure what an ordinary bank would do in Indiana."
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,708.793,710.541,But they went into the business in this case?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,710.541,712.744,"--Much to their chagrin, at this time."
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,715.4,734.968,"Part of the response to Justice Blackmun's question, indeed, that in many cases banks and insurance companies that have numerous mortgages that they are holding arrange... make arrangements to see that all of the legal publications are sent to them and checked by someone."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,739.811,751.119,"--I think notice by posting and publication to a bank or to the Mennonite Board of Missions, each, under Indiana law would be unconstitutional."
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,753.493,755.352,Even if the bank sees the notice?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,755.352,758.397,"--Not if the bank actually saw the notice, Your Honor, no."
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,765.16,783.856,"Well, this is not inherence, and part of the system of lending on secured loans with mortgages or trusts, that there's an obligation on the part of the holder of the mortgage to keep in touch with the situation."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,783.856,788.26,I think the Mennonite Board of Missions did exactly that in this case.
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.657,825.48,"There are no requirements for a bank or an insurance company to keep a close check on possible foreclosures or additional liens against their security, but they do it as a matter of prudence."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,825.48,844.019,"--They have, perhaps, the resources and the sophistication to do that, but the Mennonite Board of Missions as a charitable organization was not accustomed to doing something like that nor did the law require that they do that."
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.48,911.492,"So, it isn't simply a question of having to pay a penalty plus the amount the tax sale purchaser paid by the time your client had notice?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,911.492,912.46,That's correct.
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.392,925.845,How long was the redemption period?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,925.845,932.061,The redemption period is two years when the property is purchased by a private individual as in this case.
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.061,942.292,"You mean, that for two years this property had been sold for taxes and your client had a mortgage on it, but had no knowledge of the fact that it had been sold for taxes?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,942.292,943.901,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.664,951.742,And was in possession?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,951.742,953.724,And was in possession of the property.
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.0,986.618,"I think most mortgagees in the agreement between the mortgagor and the mortgagee have an agreement whereby the mortgagor has to pay taxes, and the mortgagee his some overseeing by virtue of an escrow fund, doesn't it?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,986.618,999.689,"As far as what type of sophisticated mortgage transaction there may be in the case you mentioned as far as escrowing the money, that is not what happened in this case."
1982.82-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.092,1016.574,Well do you think that's really the basis for a constitutional argument?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1024.352,1036.144,"--Under the facts of this case I do believe that's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because I think the focus of this Court really should be on what the state did, or really what the state failed to do."
1982.82-11,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.065,1046.374,May I ask... there was no notice before either the tax sale or the expiration of the redemption period.
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1052.029,1056.495,"Had there been mailed notice to the Mennonite Board of Missions, yes."
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1073.458,1075.13,Was that because of this litigation?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1075.13,1079.579,"I submit that that's in all likelihood true, Justice Blackmun."
1982.82-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.652,1100.525,How prevalent are the statutes requiring notice to mortgagees?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1100.525,1104.399,"Are you talking about nationwide, Justice White?"
1982.82-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.399,1104.836,Yes.
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1104.836,1112.504,There is a Yale Law Review article cited in the brief and it is a 1975 article.
1982.82-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.124,1126.889,How about the remaining case of states?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1126.889,1133.277,Of those 21 there... since that law review article--
1982.82-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.277,1137.197,"I know, but how about the other states besides the 21?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1137.197,1142.992,--Most states do provide for notice by mail to owners of property.
1982.82-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.992,1146.788,"Well, your inference is that all the other states besides the 21, correct?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1146.788,1149.13,I can't... I cannot affirmatively tell you that.
1982.82-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.238,1155.003,"Well, if not, the number would be more than 21."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1155.003,1161.156,"It may well be the remaining 29 do, Justice White, but I do not know for sure."
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1164.921,1170.918,"Mr. Cohen, I suppose it's totally irrelevant but was Mrs. Moore a member of the church?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1170.918,1178.618,"--No, she was not a member of the Mennonite Church, and this was an arms-length transaction between the parties."
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1199.531,1209.371,"In this recording of the mortgage deed, is an address given for the Mennonite Board of Missions to which notice could be sent?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1209.371,1210.074,--Okay.
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1220.335,1227.285,"In a small community, how would one go about finding out the... where to locate the Mennonite Board of Missions?"
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1227.285,1233.112,"I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, in Elkhart County, the Mennonite Board of Missions are well-known."
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1233.112,1236.048,Well I'm... that's why I pointedly did not pick Elkhart.
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1257.07,1262.459,I'm not sure I quite understand your question.
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.459,1264.849,How could you find out if you wanted... suppose you wanted to join the church?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1269.425,1271.486,"In Fairfax, Virginia?"
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1276.204,1286.589,"Well I'm... some people might be that much interested in it to make such a call, but a great many might not be."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1286.589,1309.175,"But, confining ourselves to the specific facts of this case, this Court has said that adequate notice under due process is notice reasonably calculated to inform interested persons of a pending action to provide them an opportunity to appear and assert their rights."
1982.82-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1352.001,1360.106,Doesn't the Mennonite Board obey the condition of the mortgage that you annually send us the receipt for your taxes?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1360.106,1362.809,They did not have anything like that.
1982.82-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.809,1364.073,"I say, couldn't they have done that."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1364.073,1372.602,"They could have, Justice Marshall, but again, I think what private individuals may do is not the focus of this case."
1982.82-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1378.241,1378.913,Why not?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1378.913,1383.692,--Because constitutionally I believe the focus should be on what the state did.
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1383.692,1394.673,"This country has gone for about almost two hundred years now with notice by publication in many areas, affecting important rights."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1401.091,1412.463,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that this is something that has been determined by this Court in Mullane... in the Mullane case and has been determined by--"
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1412.463,1414.461,"Yes, but not in this precise context."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1414.461,1416.507,--The--
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1416.507,1418.553,"If it had been, you wouldn't have to be here."
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1418.553,1421.193,"--That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1624.189,1627.282,Are all of those under the Federal Constitution or under state constitutions?
1982.82-11,0,44377,william_j_cohen,,1627.282,1640.697,--The... all of those cases interpreted this Court's rulings in Mullane and in Schroeder and in Walker and all talked about the Federal Constitution and not state constitutional questions.
1982.82-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1658.096,1664.516,Mr. Miller.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1664.516,1668.077,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.82-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1726.756,1730.629,"So, if we were in a title state it wouldn't make a difference?"
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1730.629,1730.801,The question wouldn't be any different?
1982.82-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1757.759,1761.664,"And yet the loss is just as great, whether it's non-ownership or--"
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1761.664,1762.414,"Well, let me--"
1982.82-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1762.414,1763.523,--or estate or a title one.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1763.523,1765.21,--Let me answer it this way.
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.278,1791.606,But you started out by saying it was a property right.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1791.606,1800.024,"--Well, my reading indicates that whether it is an interest in real estate or a ""property right"" as used in the Constitution wouldn't make any difference."
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.116,1806.631,But a property right isn't an interest in property?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1806.631,1807.285,It is.
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.285,1810.175,And it's owned by the mortgagee?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1818.204,1820.171,I don't think I understand the question.
1982.82-11,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1855.954,1869.37,--Do you think this Court's previous holdings give an indication that we would regard a mortgage interest as so insignificant as to not come within the kinds of interests that we have protected--
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1869.37,1869.933,"Oh, no."
1982.82-11,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.933,1871.417,--under a Mullane type doctrine?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1871.417,1874.057,"Anticipating the question, I believe it is."
1982.82-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.31,1914.806,I'm going to assume that Indiana has a lien law comparable to all other states so that a mechanic or a laborer who performs some services or furnishes materials could file a lien on the property.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1914.806,1915.321,Yes.
1982.82-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1915.321,1917.663,"Now that's certainly a property right, isn't it?"
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1917.663,1918.085,Yes.
1982.82-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.974,1926.317,But is it essentially an Indiana law the same as the mortgage lienor's... mortgagees lien rights?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,1928.098,1929.628,--Each has a lien.
1982.82-11,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2150.399,2160.365,"May I ask you, Mr. Miller, does the dissent in the New Jersey case, which I have not read, or maybe you have if an argument ready, what is the state interest in not giving notice?"
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2168.267,2169.564,Well--
1982.82-11,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2169.564,2170.236,--pay up?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2170.236,2172.922,--The answer to that is yes and no.
1982.82-11,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2302.338,2323.986,"Even in the case of mortgages, it occurs to me that, although of course 70 or 80 percent of the mortgages are held by big institutions, when interest rates get real high as they have been in the last few years, there are a lot of purchase money mortgages held by individuals on second mortgage interests and the like and I suppose that's the area in which there's the possibility of this sort of thing happening."
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2323.986,2326.203,"Yes, there is."
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.409,2611.058,"Wouldn't you think that most of the professional moneylenders, big institutions whom you say can take care... whom you say can take care of themselves, would take care of themselves in a way that there would never be an occasion to have a tax sale or send out any notice."
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2636.391,2641.296,"Well, I... can agree with that."
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.342,2644.435,I would suppose you have to--
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2644.435,2660.148,"Well, in part I do, because it's obviously true in part, but two answers: One, I think the question before the Court is, what's the constitutionally necessary minimum; and, two, in Mullane--"
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.148,2664.177,--In argument I would think you'd be making the same argument if they never published anything.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2664.177,2666.442,"--No, I think--"
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2666.442,2667.488,"No notice, no publication."
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2667.488,2668.02,--No--
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.02,2669.769,Mortgagees can take care of themselves.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2669.769,2673.158,"--No... no, because in--"
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.158,2678.062,"Well, you know that nonprofessionals aren't going to go look... go get any notice from publication."
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2678.062,2684.232,"--No, and I don't rest my argument on the fact that they would take care of themselves."
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.573,2690.479,"Not actual notice, just notice."
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2690.479,2691.26,--It was not actual.
1982.82-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2692.011,2695.929,Wasn't that published notice for the purpose of attracting a lot people to come in and bid?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2695.929,2697.132,--It's one of the reasons.
1982.82-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2697.132,2697.867,One?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2724.357,2725.06,Right.
1982.82-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2725.06,2726.464,But it serves a real purpose.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2726.464,2727.199,"It does, and I--"
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.199,2730.946,It doesn't serve the purpose of giving notice to the mortgagees.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2730.946,2744.113,"--Well it's not in the record, but that is not so... at least... in my experiences, is the banks always check and have people... or at savings and loans... they always check and have people to check those."
1982.82-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.706,2750.783,They want to know when the sale is so they can bid.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2750.783,2758.92,I submit that notice by publication is notice to the people in that county to protect themselves.
1982.82-11,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2758.92,2759.185,Okay.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2765.792,2774.554,"In a... where the post office name and address of the mortgagee is in the system yes, it would be."
1982.82-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2917.122,2919.059,Where is that in the Joint Appendix?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2919.059,2923.025,"--Page 45, where the mortgage of the Mennonite Board of Missions is set out."
1982.82-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2923.025,2929.461,I find that it appears to be some sort of a brief on page 45... is it this tan--
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2929.461,2931.164,"Yes, the tan Joint Appendix."
1982.82-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.164,2935.286,--Where is it now?
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2935.286,2936.599,Page 45.
1982.82-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2936.599,2941.253,I think your... this seems to be a section of arguments.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2944.315,2948.423,I have mortgage and--
1982.82-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2948.423,2955.965,--I think... at least some of us up here don't seem to have the same numbering or perhaps the same document.
1982.82-11,1,39929,robert_w_miller,,2955.965,2959.293,--I can only tell you that I got my Joint Appendix from the other counsel.
1982.82-11,2,44377,william_j_cohen,,3480.444,3482.661,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-11,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3482.661,3487.456,"Mr. Cohen, does the record show who prepared this mortgage?"
1982.82-11,2,44377,william_j_cohen,,3487.456,3489.378,"Yes, it does, Justice Powell."
1982.82-11,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3524.131,3526.113,"Well, but the county seat is in Goshen, isn't it?"
1982.82-11,2,44377,william_j_cohen,,3526.113,3527.004,"Yes, it is."
1982.82-11,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3528.535,3530.751,How is it from... and is the sheriff in Goshen?
1982.82-11,2,44377,william_j_cohen,,3530.751,3533.798,The sheriff has an office in Goshen and in Elkhart.
1982.82-11,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3541.436,3546.48,"What's the... what's the population of Goshen and of Elkhart, roughly?"
1982.82-11,2,44377,william_j_cohen,,3546.48,3551.963,"Elkhart's about 42 thousand, Goshen is about 15, 20 thousand."
1982.82-11,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3551.963,3553.369,Thank you.
1982.82-11,2,44377,william_j_cohen,,3558.929,3559.711,Yes.
1982.82-11,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3559.711,3564.066,Do you know whether that was continued after she defaulted on taxes?
1982.82-11,2,44377,william_j_cohen,,3564.066,3577.826,"It was my understanding that she continued to pay everything and unbeknownst to the Mennonite Board of Missions, she did not pay the taxes right after the period of time to redeem the property expired."
1982.82-11,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3682.081,3697.326,"Well it is hard to understand how that would have helped the board in this case with no address, and I don't think our cases have gone so far as to require county sheriffs to go out personally and look for locations."
1982.82-11,2,44377,william_j_cohen,,3697.326,3705.337,"Mullane says, Justice O'Connor, if the name is a matter of public knowledge or if easily ascertainable."
1982.82-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3705.337,3706.462,"Thank you, gentlemen."
