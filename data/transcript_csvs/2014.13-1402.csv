2014.13-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.555,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 13-1402, Kerry, Secretary of State, v. Fauzia Din. Mr. Kneedler."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.555,23.73,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly held that the power to exclude aliens is inherent in sovereignty and necessary to defending the nation against encroachments and dangers."
2014.13-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,52.23,58.63,Could I ask you a question? Assume the following hypothetical.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,81.11,84.26,At least two responses to that point.
2014.13-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,133.49,177.54,"I asked -- I have a real problem, which is that's what we were told after September 11th, and we have evidence that people were kept for months and months and months, and some were released after there was further probing by the courts, and it was determined that people had been erroneously identified. So I'm not challenging good faith, but I'm just questioning how someone caught up in an administrative nightmare -- you're suggesting that the wife has absolutely no interest in -- in -- in her marriage in not having the government arbitrarily keep her spouse out."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,177.54,184.34,"She obviously has an interest, but -- but she is affected only indirectly by the denial of the visa to her husband."
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,184.44,191.665,"Well, it -- it would seem to me that you're fighting the hypothetical if you're basically saying, well, that's not going to happen. Suppose it happened."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,202.12,216.035,"The -- it -- I think it's clear under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, which is one subset of the recognition of Congress' broad power over the exclusion of aliens, which includes conferring the power on executive officers."
2014.13-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.64,217.31,"But the consular, you have denied --"
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,217.31,228.34,"And then we can -- and then we get to the question of whether -- of whether or not the wife, in this case, has at least a minimum right to make sure that the identification is correct."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,229.7,236.71,There is no -- there is no right of judicial review because the consular -- the doctrine of consular nonreviewability applies equally to her.
2014.13-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,242.14,265.46,"Is there -- is there no -- is there no exception to the consular nonreviewability doctrine? That is, assuming people make mistakes, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, bureaucrats -- some consulates -- consuls have been known to have a bureaucratic mentality and some may act for improper reasons."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,278.71,284.84,That -- that is -- that is our position with respect to a consular officer having a bureaucratic point of view.
2014.13-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,296.64,310.03,"Now, it's your position that the government could basically say to a wife in the United States, you have no rights whatsoever to challenge the arbitrary -- or a statement by the government."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,316.525,318.68,Someone in the United States or --
2014.13-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,318.68,319.21,Yes.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,319.21,324.8,"In the United States, it would be different, although it would not confer rights on her but the -- but the husband --"
2014.13-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,324.8,336.825,"Ah, so you're saying in that situation marriage has -- gives her no rights to say, you're interfering with my marriage by arbitrarily keeping my husband."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,342.6,352.96,"Well, the husband would have -- what -- whatever -- whatever action the government took against the husband, if he was in the United States, he would have his own due process rights. This --"
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.96,361.67,"I suppose the wife would have standing to appeal a wrongful conviction of her husband, right?"
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,361.67,363.02,That is the point I was going to make.
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.86,371.58,"And in a regular criminal case, and he doesn't want to appeal, and she says, oh, I'm going to be deprived of my husband, so she has a right to appeal."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,372.6,373.64,It -- it's not the law.
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.41,389.86,I understand -- excuse me. I understand the O'Bannon case.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,420.17,423.475,We're not saying they didn't have standing to make a First Amendment claim.
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.19,444.63,You -- you -- you say that she has the -- the right to contest the denial of the visa.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,444.63,445.19,No.
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,462.89,471.03,"Well, you always have the right to come into court to -- to say that you think you have -- have a right to contest, and the court says you don't, and you throw it out."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,471.03,471.28,Right.
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.0,475.64,But that's not -- I don't think that's the way you can read Mandel.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,475.64,496.91,"Well, I think -- I think the predicate discussion of the First Amendment there was the government was arguing there's no -- there's no real First Amendment problem just on First Amendment terms because you could always hear the same information by reading a book or -- or the telephone or something like that, and the Court said the First Amendment interest -- looking at First Amendment interest doesn't disappear in -- in that situation."
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,496.91,504.73,Suppose I read the Mandel case to say that the professors have a right to contest the denial of the visa.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,520.93,521.68,First of all --
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.68,528.0,Then it -- then it seems to me that the wife here has the right to demand a reason.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,528.0,539.46,"First of all, Mandel involved the -- a decision on the waiver, not on -- not a decision by a consular officer abroad to deny a visa, which -- which is really right at the teeth of the consular --"
2014.13-1402,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,539.46,542.2,"I don't see why that doesn't cut the other way, Mr. Kneedler."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,578.015,602.685,"Well, I don't disagree -- we don't think there should be review in -- in either case. I think part of what might have been motivating the court in Mandel was that the discretionary denial of the waiver might have been based on the characteristics of the U.S. citizen seeking it. There can't be any claim like that here. This -- this -- the terrorism grounds go entirely to the -- for a visa denial -- go entirely to the characteristics of the alien abroad."
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,612.72,625.7,"So is it no matter what? Is that -- I mean, a woman is married -- an American woman is married to a foreign -- foreign person, asks for a visa."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,657.09,659.42,Our position is that there is no judicial review.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.42,683.14,"Are you saying -- I want a clear answer to my question because what I'm trying to do, obviously, is make the most far out case I can think of, and -- and I want to know if the Government of the United States thinks that if it is the policy even of the -- of the consulars of the United States that husbands and wives must live separately, there is no judicial review no matter what?"
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,683.14,683.7,Well --
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.7,685.585,Is that the position or is it not?
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,685.585,688.2,That is -- that would be our position.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,688.2,688.47,All right.
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.41,692.83,Let me give you an equally absurd hypothetical.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,693.12,694.6,"Oh, I don't know if mine is so absurd."
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.6,694.69,Wait.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.48,726.33,I'm not worried about that case.
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.33,726.59,What?
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.59,757.695,"I'm worried about that case where there is an American citizen who is married and that the decision of the consular official will prevent her no matter how ridiculous, and take all of Justice Scalia's points to make it ridiculous as you want, but the result of this is that an American citizen either must live separately from her spouse forever or must give up her right as an American to live in her native land."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,764.175,765.95,That is our position.
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.27,769.84,I think he knew that.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,769.84,770.65,No.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,772.05,775.14,If I may -- if I may add one point here.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.23,803.14,"Well, terrorist activities are defined in this statute to include such things as, let's say, you're in a -- a particular country where this could happen."
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.5,837.745,Enough for me.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,837.745,848.835,"Well, I'm just saying it isn't obvious to me that you can tell -- now deprive a person of even telling him what the reason is for saying he falls within this section."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,848.835,864.8,"Well, on that -- on that point, now, first Shaughnessy and Musai are controlling. In those situations, aliens who either reached our borders were -- were denied entry on the basis of confidential information that was deemed necessary for the security of the United States."
2014.13-1402,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,880.21,925.3,"Can I come back to -- can I come back to Justice Breyer's earlier hypothetical. Suppose there were a case where there is incontrovertible proof that the consular officer denied the visa for some incredible ground based on racism or belief that husbands and wives shouldn't live together. Suppose there's a -- a tape -- a video recording or audio recording of the consular officer saying this is what I believe, and this is what I do when I pass on these visas. Would there be no administrative avenue of relief if that information was submitted to the State Department? Would there be no opportunity to -- to get a correction of the visa denial in that way?"
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,925.3,926.12,Of course there would.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,939.455,944.345,How can you get that relief if you don't tell the person what the reason is?
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,944.345,947.0,It won't be denied.
2014.13-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,965.13,966.13,But that can't be.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,982.73,990.62,"Well, as Justice Alito -- I think we have to assume the regularity that the supervising consular officer would be asked."
2014.13-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.62,999.9,Can the person -- the relative who's claiming preferential status -- can she initiate such a review? She can't.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1001.45,1013.1,"She has no -- she has no -- there's no procedure that gives her entitlement, and properly so because it's not about her, it's about him. But she could certainly bring the information to the attention of the State Department."
2014.13-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1022.58,1035.13,"And was given -- given the same -- the -- her representative was given the same answer, citing the statute and saying we -- we don't disclose any particulars."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1035.13,1037.66,"Right, but that -- but that's the system Congress set up."
2014.13-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1056.785,1057.65,Mr. Kneedler --
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1057.65,1058.62,-- and reside.
2014.13-1402,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1058.62,1076.39,"If Mandel did control this case, what argument would you make -- or could you make an argument that you -- that you met the Mandel standard? And as I understood the Mandel standard, it wasn't that high."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1082.25,1083.3,Okay.
2014.13-1402,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1149.32,1158.14,"Well, do you have to -- I mean, what's the level of generality or specificity that you have to cite? Suppose they just said, well, you know, this was done under 1182."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1159.555,1162.765,"As a constitutional matter, we think it would be sufficient, yes."
2014.13-1402,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1163.97,1167.36,We did this under the INA. Is that facially legitimate?
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1167.36,1168.275,Yes.
2014.13-1402,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1171.32,1173.34,"So really, it's a reason that's not a reason at all."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1178.4,1182.525,But -- but here we have the specific paragraph dealing with terrorism.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.525,1187.225,It isn't -- this is -- this is actually a serious quote; I didn't mean it facetiously.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1279.675,1281.725,"I mean, that --"
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.725,1284.82,Does this fellow have a wife? Does this fellow have a wife or is this --
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1284.82,1285.35,Yes.
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.35,1288.24,"Oh, it's the wife that's -- that's making the claim."
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1288.24,1296.755,"I -- I -- I want to -- I want to make one thing very clear again with respect to exclusions under paragraph (b), it is not done by the consular officer alone."
2014.13-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1319.24,1345.475,"Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, could you give us an idea, before you conclude, about what has been the consequence of a decision? The Ninth Circuit in this Bustamante case -- that was 2008 -- what has happened in the Ninth Circuit between 2008 and 2014 with respect to these relative applications? How have they fared?"
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1345.475,1353.1,There -- there have been -- there have been a number that -- that have arisen. There's the Ibrahim case that was -- that -- that is cited in the papers.
2014.13-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.59,1398.71,"But in the cases that we have, you cited extending it to a child, but have any of them held that the government failed to show a facially legitimate bona fide reason?"
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1398.71,1410.4,"The Ibrahim case required the specification of a particular subsection based on Din, said that there had to be a particular subsection of (b). And again, I want to step -- I want to step back."
2014.13-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1429.955,1447.59,"Do you -- do you think that in the instance, suppose that Justice Breyer asked this particular subsection has to be cited, that if the consular were to cite that, this might give some indication as to our intelligence-gathering capability and the information that we have?"
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1447.59,1447.88,Absolutely.
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1463.15,1464.15,But why not? If there is --
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1464.15,1472.6,"Whatever -- whatever interests the wife has in this situation, they are derivative and indirect, even if this Court is going to credit them with some force here."
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1484.21,1484.68,Of course.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1505.24,1505.98,The case should --
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.98,1511.88,-- to review -- to review a matter where there is a national security interest at stake.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1511.88,1518.38,It is exceedingly rare for the government to be put in a position where it has to submit classified information to a court.
2014.13-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.46,1522.07,"Courts are very good at this stuff, aren't they?"
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1522.07,1523.0,"Well, as --"
2014.13-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1523.0,1527.915,At assessing the -- the level of danger to -- to operatives.
2014.13-1402,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1527.915,1559.415,"This Court has said that -- that they're not and -- and in situations -- in situations in the domestic context, it may be necessary to allow for some consideration of classified information because the person involved has due process rights and -- and can insist on some information. Here we're in a situation where the person directly affected, the person involved, an alien abroad, has no rights of his own to know what the basis for the government's action is. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."
2014.13-1402,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1559.415,1564.155,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Haddad."
