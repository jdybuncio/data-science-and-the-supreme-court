1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.392,"Number 40, California, Petitioner, versus Lyman E. Buzard."
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,32.509,36.662,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,67.648,72.809,"Well, and he didn't play them, there was residence state because there was no such fee required or --"
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,72.809,74.025,No.
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,104.676,106.364,"Well, that's not what I'm trying to get at."
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,115.804,117.167,This is so.
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,121.151,133.335,"But they want to get it because they say the State of Washington under its law even though the State of Washington could not get it since he wasn't driving the car inside Washington, is that it?"
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,133.335,135.1,That is correct.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,135.703,142.054,Had the -- had the captain taken out of the license in any state Ms. Maier?
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,142.054,142.749,Yes.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,144.848,145.161,Very well.
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,145.161,148.702,-- now you'll take out the license in Alabama.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,223.806,225.298,Then what he --
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,225.298,228.257,He discussed registration and the payment of the fees --
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,228.257,228.581,"Oh, yes."
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,228.581,237.77,"-- at the -- he did not, however, pay either the registration or license fee."
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,331.998,333.853,What's the amount involved here?
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,333.853,338.84,"The amount involved -- you mean the amount of the fine, Your Honor?This is a criminal statute."
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,338.84,341.161,"No, I wasn't thinking of the fine, maybe --"
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,341.161,343.006,"Oh, the basic licensing?"
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,343.006,343.84,Yes.
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,343.84,346.339,Would have been approximately $100.
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,346.339,348.711,$100.
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,348.711,356.206,There would have been initially about a dollar difference between the total fee in California and Washington.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,366.921,369.268,What trial was it Ms. Maier?
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,369.268,374.393,"It was an automobile '58, '59, suppose 1959."
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,374.393,381.02,Suppose that have been a Cadillac what would be -- what was the license fee had been?
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,381.02,387.997,It would have been depended 2% of the market value of the car.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,387.997,388.94,Market value.
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,388.94,389.116,Yes.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,389.116,389.504,And this is --
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,389.504,399.949,"But the California tax, Your Honor, has been characterized by the California Court, as a privilege tax."
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,440.327,443.908,The Supreme Court has -- has determined that --
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,443.908,444.451,That is (Voice Overlap).
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,444.451,445.626,-- in that way?
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,445.626,445.905,That is true.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,445.905,474.979,"Well, wasn't this tax -- wasn't this registration fee fixed in lieu -- in lieu of the property taxes in the counties (Voice Overlap) and don't they now return a certain amount of this -- of this fee to the counties in lieu of the counties letting any ad valorem tax?"
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,474.979,489.006,"Your Honor, it is fixed on value that it's a certain percentage of it is back for purposes of maintaining the roads throughout the state and also law enforcement too."
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,489.006,497.484,"Yes, but you do -- you do sub -- sub grant this money much of it to the counties, do you not?"
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,497.484,500.071,That is true (Voice Overlap) the population.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,500.071,504.796,And the counties do not have any personal property tax on automobiles at all?
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,505.019,505.374,No.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,507.025,508.71,Yes.
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,512.94,518.355,"Well, Your Honor it would be an ad valorem tax to the extent of basic value."
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,518.355,519.351,Like what?
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,519.351,526.096,To the extent its basic value but basically the tax is a privilege tax though it may be measured by the value.
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,531.042,556.885,"Well, I was there when the -- I was there when the counties levied an ad valorem tax on automobiles as personal property and they were very difficult for the counties to levy this tax that automobiles are moving all over, they couldn't catch them."
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,586.976,591.965,"I -- I don't believe you are, Your Honor."
1965.40,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,591.965,610.145,I was just wondering if this is really just a license tax or whether it is also an ad valorem tax like the Mississippi one where they have to pay the ad valorem tax in order to get the registration certificate.
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,610.145,619.684,"Well, we -- there is no question that they have to pay this tax in order to register the cost."
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,654.896,668.168,"That suggests Ms. Maier, in this, I take it for the purpose of instruction of the federal statute, the state label would not to be conclusive, would it?"
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,668.168,668.203,No --
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,668.203,668.946,But you call it -- you said --
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,668.946,669.064,-- that --
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,669.064,672.144,-- it's a privilege tax (Voice Overlap) but I gather for --
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,672.144,681.152,"Well, this -- Your Honor as I understand, this Court has the ultimate right to determine the nature of any tax regardless (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,681.152,697.293,"Well, I'm wondering for the purposes of the language in the federal statute (Voice Overlap) property taxes whether you were labeled privilege tax would conclude us on whether or not it's spelled within the federal statute would suppose there."
1965.40,0,21269,doris_h_maier,,697.293,703.415,"Well, under the exemption provision of the federal statute that is too big."
1965.40,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1175.248,1180.036,"Mr. Keister or Mr. Greer, I beg your pardon."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1180.036,1189.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1750.522,1752.969,"Mr. Greer, may I ask you a question from confusion."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1772.087,1779.693,"If Your Honor please, the Court is quite correct on -- I will -- I will resume that point."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1780.342,1784.243,"Well, (Voice Overlap) I don't find that in your brief, you didn't make that argument in your brief."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1784.243,1784.789,"No, I didn't."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1807.67,1809.499,"Well, I don't find -- I don't find it."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1809.499,1810.988,"It's a jurisdictional point, if Your Honor please."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1810.988,1818.756,But the California Supreme Court -- are we suppose to read that opinion as resting on -- that this was an improper prosecution under the Vehicle Code?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1818.756,1825.349,"No, if Your Honor please, the California Supreme Court said that the man was not guilty under Section 4000 of Vehicle Code."
1965.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1866.803,1868.355,He paid that fee?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1868.355,1874.515,"He tried to pay it, if the Court please, and was frustrated in paying it."
1965.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.144,2220.426,How much did you say?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2220.426,2222.341,That would be 2% tax for at least.
1965.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2222.341,2225.692,"Hundred dollars, 2% of hundred thousand?"
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2225.692,2227.017,Did I say hundred thousand?
1965.40,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2245.181,2248.202,"Mr. Greer, may ask."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2262.45,2265.227,Yes sir.
1965.40,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2265.227,2269.202,And you haven't brief that I take it.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2269.202,2274.427,I have to ask the Court to take judicial notice of the code structure in California.
1965.40,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2274.427,2283.778,Is that your only basis -- your only authority for that statement?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2283.778,2289.542,That the language under this code in Section 4000 of the Vehicle Code refers only to the Vehicle Code?
1965.40,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2289.542,2293.539,Yes.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2293.539,2311.077,"Well, I think the title of the Vehicle Code which I cited earlier which states that title of the statute and act to establish a Vehicle Code thereby consolidated in revising the law relating to vehicles and vehicular traffic."
1965.40,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2311.077,2325.868,"Well, I don't know perhaps undisputed, perhaps your point is undisputed but presently we don't have any authority call except for your oral argument, is that right?"
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2325.868,2369.171,"I think if the Court please that the -- that a substantial portion of what I'm now saying is not spelled out in the briefs here before filed and the reason that I have taken this position this morning is because I do think the point is jurisdictional -- serious constitutional problems Mr. Justice Fortas, if an inquiry could be made as to whether or not these taxes under the Revenue and Taxation Code could've been exacted under a Vehicle Code prosecution."
1965.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2391.041,2411.933,Is there any cross reference between the Vehicle Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code which says that the -- the so-called fee in -- in the Revenue Code shall be included in the motor vehicle license fee?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2411.933,2413.108,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1965.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2413.108,2414.931,There isn't any cross --
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2414.931,2430.275,"And let me say this, that I have -- I have for the last week or two, I have been going over those codes right assiduously and there is -- there is no statement such is this in the Vehicle Code."
1965.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2446.481,2448.797,I'm sure that is the practice.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2460.738,2471.032,It -- I think that if Your Honor please that it is the practice but we are here talking of course about a criminal prosecution.
1965.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2471.032,2471.532,Yes.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2472.446,2490.499,"And the State of California, the people of the state which initiated this prosecution chose to limit it to Section 4000 of the Vehicle Code and the Vehicle Code I vouch to Your Honor that I have searched it most carefully and that there is no cross reference."
1965.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2559.147,2571.094,Am I right in understanding that there's no mention to this point in your brief or in California's brief or in Government's amicus brief or in the opinion of the Supreme Court of California?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2571.094,2595.368,"Mr. Justice Stewart, the statutes are quoted on -- other than that, I would have to say that there is certainly no discussion and that I've -- I've talked to my colleagues about this say, if it weren't a point touching on jurisdiction, I -- I -- I wouldn't raise it."
1965.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.354,2632.794,"There's no mention of this point in the Supreme Court's opinion of California, isn't it?"
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2632.794,2634.991,Only to this extent.
1965.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2648.159,2653.152,"Well, through that because of the impact of the federal statute."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2653.152,2657.679,"When insofar as registration is concern, if Your Honor please, I reach it through the merits."
1965.40,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2683.616,2685.768,"Now, I'm now reading to the Court's opinion."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2701.629,2717.004,"Well, I think the point I was making Mr. Justice is they said it couldn't be convicted under Section 4000 as far as registration was concerned because the state had itself frustrated his attempt to register and the evidence on that is very conclusive."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2758.493,2760.551,Did he tendered $8?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2760.551,2763.486,He went to the -- there's no evidence Your Honor.
1965.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.172,2813.997,"Well, let's assume for the moment that they said to him, “Alright, you pay the $8.”"
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2834.56,2835.077,"Yes sir, but --"
1965.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.077,2836.745,When you say that issue wasn't here?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2836.745,2837.155,"No sir, that's not here."
1965.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2837.155,2839.01,Not even that issue.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2839.01,2848.285,I think the State of California have a much stronger case because we are not here contending that any servicemen should be out on the highways without registration.
1965.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.514,2861.392,"Yes, but why should we assume against it, why should we make reduction against the State of California in this case --"
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2861.392,2864.014,Because they wrongfully asked for a hundred dollars --
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2864.014,2867.49,I know but you never offered the $8 either.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2867.49,2870.518,"We went down there, if the Court please, and tried to register."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2870.518,2872.747,"Well, you tried to register without paying any money?"
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2872.747,2880.435,"No, if the Court please, the officer testified that he went down there and that he didn't have that much cash with him."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2880.435,2883.313,"Well, not a hundred dollars but they offered the $8."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2884.21,2885.129,The record --
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2885.129,2886.526,-- (Voice Overlap) $8 he would've tendered it.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2886.526,2890.225,"The record is silent on that point, if the Court please."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2894.87,2895.678,I agree.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2895.678,2895.977,And --
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2895.977,2899.854,(Voice Overlap) he might have offered the $8.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2899.854,2903.702,All -- the only answer I can give to Your Honors is the record is silent to it.
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2903.702,2914.292,But I gather what you're now suggesting is that this prosecution was on the premise that it could be sustained by proof of the failure of the 2% tax.
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2914.292,2914.946,Yes sir.
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2914.946,2920.227,And you say it can be sustained only by proof of the failure of the $8 required by the Vehicle Code?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2920.227,2921.12,Precisely.
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2921.12,2921.652,Is that it?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2921.652,2922.131,Yes sir.
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2922.131,2931.825,And you say that the reversal of the conviction of the Supreme Court of California was on the ground that the state's proof didn't add up to a violation of the Vehicle Code?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2931.825,2933.519,Exactly and the California Supreme --
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2933.519,2936.517,You can't find that -- anything in the California Supreme Court --
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2936.517,2954.72,"Well, it -- you will find this, if the Court please, you will find the statement that the -- the California Court held that that in fact, here's the language, “In fact --"
1965.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.72,2955.395,What page you are?
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2955.395,2959.322,That's on page 46 of the record.
1965.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.371,2982.817,"Well, I know that the Court went right on and said that California could not force him to register and to pay the fees and penalties, is that right, because of the federal statute?"
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2982.817,2984.798,"Well, they said this, “Contentions which looked to --"
1965.40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2984.798,2989.976,"Well, I would've thought they have rules that they couldn't even collect the $8."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2989.976,2991.097,"No, I don't think sir."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2998.134,3018.346,"Well, Mr. Greer I looked at the language page 46, defendant's refusal to make payment of the fees and penalties, this is the California Supreme Court opinion, I gather, are based on the contention in Section 4000 insofar as it require the payment of fees and penalties and those of the $8, were they not, correct?"
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,3018.346,3021.069,"No, there is no penalty on the $8, if the Court please."
1965.40,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3021.069,3032.999,"Well, all right, but it says that Section 4000 insofar as it require the payment of fees and penalty it was certainly the $8 did not apply to him because the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act."
1965.40,1,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,3044.023,3066.142,"I think this, I think the decision of the California Supreme Court, if the Court please, is a very liberal one and quite properly a very liberal one and I would be most happy for its decision to be affirmed on a proper case raising to those issues that comes with this Court and I think with attention."
1965.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3066.142,3069.495,Ms. Maier.
1965.40,2,21269,doris_h_maier,,3069.495,3074.129,If it please Your Honor.
1965.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3184.357,3188.509,"May I ask you, where Section 4000 is in the record?"
1965.40,2,21269,doris_h_maier,,3188.509,3199.063,Section 4000 is -- you can see in the petitioner's brief at page 6 thereof.
1965.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.851,3230.262,"So, what are we talking about, the $8 as a whole --"
1965.40,2,21269,doris_h_maier,,3230.262,3236.392,"We believe, Your Honor, we're talking about the entire amounts involved.(Voice Overlap)"
1965.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.392,3261.291,"Does it make any difference to you on the issue that you have briefed and argued that which is to whether only the $8 or the full amount is involved between the right of the California to put -- to put anything on a serviceman who have not registered in his home state, the issue is the same whether it's $8 or a hundred, isn't it?"
1965.40,2,21269,doris_h_maier,,3261.291,3282.987,"Well, I believe as far as the State of California would be concerned, it would be quite important as to the taxing features also that we consider the taxing features as far as the particular point which was I am familiar in the criminal statute of it."
1965.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.001,3296.777,But if the other -- the other part of it that you said which I was asking you whether this was a property tax.
1965.40,2,21269,doris_h_maier,,3301.688,3303.896,I do not believe it is.
1965.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3306.789,3318.381,"Well, I know but you would like us to say that the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act does not bar California from collecting both, you don't want us to stop this thing, it does in far California has been collecting $8."
1965.40,2,21269,doris_h_maier,,3318.381,3318.88,That's correct.
1965.40,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3318.88,3319.555,Isn't that right?
1965.40,2,21269,doris_h_maier,,3319.555,3320.202,That's correct.
1965.40,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.202,3326.536,And that's because there is something different about the other hundred dollars.
1965.40,2,21269,doris_h_maier,,3326.536,3331.658,Thank you.
