2005.04-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.361,We'll hear argument first today in Unitherm Food Systems versus Swift Eckrich.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,8.505,12.004,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.697,101.224,"Now, was there a Rule 59 motion made here after the verdict?"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,101.224,102.025,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.367,103.789,Right.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,103.789,104.6,--of damages.
2005.04-597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.6,115.383,"Had a Rule 59 motion been made, would it preserve a sufficiency of the evidence argument in connection with the motion for new trial?"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,115.383,118.662,"Not a sufficiency of the evidence argument, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,171.914,175.885,Do any of those circuits allow an exception for plain error?
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,175.885,177.639,--Several of them do--
2005.04-597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,177.639,178.13,Yeah.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,178.13,178.563,--Your Honor.
2005.04-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.599,233.066,"Just while I have you, I'm... just while I have you here... it's not--"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,233.066,233.94,--Yes.
2005.04-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,233.94,235.173,"--probably, directly relevant to this case."
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,271.3,272.946,Your--
2005.04-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,272.946,274.46,Three more months for the defense to--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,274.46,275.211,--Yes.
2005.04-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.837,320.448,--Yes.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,320.448,321.722,--has to try it all over again.
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.405,347.42,"On the issue that's before us now, I can understand why, if the, what we used to call, JNOV is not requested after the jury verdict, the appellate court could not then enter judgment... direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law."
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,376.778,378.282,"I would, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,391.493,392.014,But--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,392.014,392.726,--concluded.
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.726,396.488,"--you haven't asked for it, but the appellate court said,"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,434.052,445.645,"Your Honor, it's our position that you can never ask for... move for a new trial for... on the ground that the evidence is against... the weight--"
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.645,446.248,"No, I'm not--"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,446.248,446.778,--of the evidence--
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.778,452.716,"--talking about ""against the weight"", because a trial judge would rarely be... if it... if a trial judge said,"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,492.627,512.197,"--Well, Your Honor, I... my response to that is that these matters, pursuant to this Court's jurisprudence in Cone and Johnson and other cases, simply mandates that the trial court be asked to pass in the first instance on this issue of sufficiency of the evidence."
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,512.197,518.807,"But, it... but it was asked by the... by the pre verdict motion."
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,542.786,548.356,"Well, Your Honor, the... if I may, the standard of review is radically different."
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,561.133,565.828,"Well, that's... the new trial comes in, by the courts that have said this, only... they'd say,"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,582.495,588.684,"Well, that's certainly what the Tenth Circuit jurisprudence provides, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,590.43,590.53,Yes.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,590.53,614.714,"And we think that that's totally at odds with this Court's rule in Cone and Johnson, that it is out of step with the law in eight Federal Circuits, that it simply is illogical to say, someone who never asked for a new trial... Your Honor, if they had... if ConAgra had sought a new trial on sufficiency of the evidence in Federal Circuit, presumably, the Federal Circuit said,"
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.128,640.23,"Well, couldn't one regard a new trial as, sort of, subsumed under the request for judgment as a matter of law?"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,660.781,684.351,"--And, Your Honor, I... my response is simply that those are two very different motions and call for two very different standards of review, and it cannot, I respectfully submit, logically be administered, when there's been no request for a new trial."
2005.04-597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.726,697.631,Would you refresh my recollection?
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,706.516,710.578,"--There... Your Honor, they had moved for a new trial in those cases."
2005.04-597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.791,718.483,"But the judgment of this Court was simply reverse, wasn't it?"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,718.483,719.928,--It was reverse.
2005.04-597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.928,720.408,There were--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,720.408,721.261,Of the appellate court--
2005.04-597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.261,721.682,--Yes.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,721.682,722.535,--of the Eighth Circuit.
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,736.286,741.901,I don't understand your response to me about vastly different standards of review.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,750.169,755.685,"At the trial or the appellate level, either one--"
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,755.685,756.276,Yes.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,756.276,756.456,--Your Honor?
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,760.719,761.46,That's why--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,761.46,761.752,But--
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,761.752,762.253,--I'm suggesting--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,762.253,762.834,--but the--
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,762.834,764.671,--that one is kind of a lesser included.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,764.671,766.195,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,781.813,784.509,"They go to different things, don't they?"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,796.948,801.97,"They... very different grounds most... most commonly, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,812.033,812.523,Well--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,812.523,813.367,--but the Court can still--
2005.04-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,813.367,813.618,--this is a--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,813.618,814.219,--grant a new trial.
2005.04-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.219,814.51,--Right.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,821.561,825.503,"Well, not insufficient evidence, but the--"
2005.04-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,825.503,825.693,No.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,825.693,827.88,--the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.325,854.249,"And that determination of what was the weight of the evidence is typically left to the trial judge, rather than to the Court of Appeals."
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,855.502,855.976,"Well, you can--"
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.976,863.819,--somewhat novel for the Court of Appeals to be reviewing a trial judge on the basis of what it thought the weight of the evidence was.
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.218,877.681,That's--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,877.681,878.061,--I--
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.061,881.01,--I don't think any appellate court has claimed that authority.
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,933.607,963.509,"--Your Honor, I think it shows respect to the trial judge to require that the trial judge be required, in the first instance, to review this evidence that the trial judge saw, heard, and has the same opportunity, as this Court has observed in cases going back over a century, to see, just like the jurors saw, and provides a perspective on it that is available to the trial judge, alone."
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.509,963.559,Well--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,963.559,963.94,"Your Honors, if--"
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.94,964.24,--it seems--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,964.24,965.254,"--I may, I'd--"
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.254,970.469,"--it seems to me that if the Court of Appeals is going to grant a new trial, it must say one of two things."
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1002.074,1002.976,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1007.869,1007.94,But--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1007.94,1008.661,--in the first instance--
2005.04-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1008.661,1010.978,"--in fact, that's not what the Courts of Appeals have said."
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1056.254,1058.941,"--That's exactly what they said, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.86,1074.859,"I suppose they could make the same... if... I mean, if that follows, they should be able to do the same thing when there has been no motion made, neither before nor after, right?"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1080.908,1081.058,--That's--
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.058,1081.909,"""But""--"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1081.909,1082.462,--that's certainly--
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.462,1083.173,"--you know,"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1090.103,1093.204,"--I may have missed, Your Honor--"
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.204,1094.889,Where no motion has been made--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1094.889,1095.692,--Yes.
2005.04-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.692,1104.969,"--neither before the verdict nor after the verdict, does any appellate court say,"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1123.314,1133.977,"Your Honor, I know of no case where an appellate court would do such a thing when there's no motion of any kind that's ever been made contesting the--"
2005.04-597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.977,1137.256,"No, but the trial court could do that, pursuant to Rule 59(d), couldn't it?"
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1137.256,1139.213,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.213,1144.779,"I say, the trial court could have done that pursuant to Rule 59(d) without a motion being filed."
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1144.779,1146.684,"I quite agree, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.015,1148.238,Thank you--
2005.04-597,0,17413,burck_bailey,,1148.238,1149.229,May I reserve the rest of my time?
2005.04-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1149.229,1149.673,"--Thank you, Mr. Bailey."
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1161.027,1163.796,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.389,1202.894,What is the usual practice with regard to the pre verdict motions?
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1206.795,1208.019,--It often is.
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.78,1211.639,--and then renewed at the... at the end of all of the evidence?
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1211.639,1213.282,--I think that's a very typical practice.
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.282,1213.715,Yes.
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1213.715,1221.76,"It doesn't... it doesn't have to be made at the close of the plaintiff case, but it can be made at any time after the opposing party has had an adequate opportunity to be heard."
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.511,1225.279,But they're really different things to be reviewed at those two times.
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1237.528,1240.124,--It is requesting the same sort of--
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.124,1240.717,Of relief.
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1240.717,1245.279,"--relief, but it... different considerations would affect the trial judge's decision whether to grant the motion."
2005.04-597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.605,1407.903,"But, Mr. Stewart, just let me clear up one thing of confusion."
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1422.308,1423.65,--We don't believe that that's the case.
2005.04-597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.956,1497.884,"So, you're saying that if the judge wants to do what I... what I hypothesized, the judge should say to the losing party,"
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1500.09,1501.244,--That's correct.
2005.04-597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1532.546,1541.211,"Can you tell me, if we adopt your position, what should a trial court do if he, alternatively, would grant a new trial?"
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1556.642,1556.832,--He should.
2005.04-597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1581.005,1581.967,"--""Shall""."
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1582.84,1583.754,"--Yeah, ""shall""."
2005.04-597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.754,1584.324,"It says ""shall""."
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1584.925,1585.128,"So,"
2005.04-597,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1595.006,1597.674,It's a... it's a conditional ruling on the new trial motion.
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1597.674,1598.205,That's correct.
2005.04-597,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1598.205,1604.505,"Because if it were a ruling on the new trial motion, you would never get up to the Court of Appeals."
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1604.505,1605.186,That's correct.
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.498,1667.635,"Yes, well, I don't know that you have to read it that way."
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1694.023,1709.069,"I mean, conceivably you could have read the rule that way at the time of Johnson, but first we have this Court's decision in Johnson, which says the submission of a post verdict Rule 50(b) motion is an essential prerequisite even for the District Court to act on the motion."
2005.04-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.488,1738.306,What about the plain error question?
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1738.306,1747.775,"I think we would say, for some of the same reasons that Mr. Bailey has identified, that plain error review would be inappropriate, because in order to have plain error, there has to be error."
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.604,1768.615,I'm not sure--
2005.04-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1768.615,1768.745,Thank you Mr. Stewart.
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.745,1769.289,--I understood.
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1783.009,1783.389,That's correct.
2005.04-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.819,1784.049,Okay.
2005.04-597,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1784.049,1789.616,"--in Johnson, that the District Court expressly reserved its ruling, and the court, nevertheless, held renewal as essential."
2005.04-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1789.616,1791.603,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,1795.533,1800.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1860.899,1862.785,May I just stop you with that point?
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,1904.087,1921.62,"--Your Honor, in the Federal Circuit, each party had the... had the ability to put any part of the record, or the entire record, before the court, and, under the Federal Circuit's own rule, they were also entitled to go back to the District Court record, whether it was in the appendix or not."
2005.04-597,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1922.914,1923.587,"Well, but if they had been on--"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,1923.587,1923.848,--was--
2005.04-597,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1923.848,1931.621,"--if they had been on notice that insufficiency of the evidence was going to be an issue, they might have put more in the record about the sufficiency of the evidence."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,1931.621,1940.576,"--When the case was appealed to the Federal Circuit, Your Honor, insufficiency of the evidence was presented as an issue at that time."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.5,1947.176,"But under this Federal Circuit's own law, it could not be, because there had not been the post verdict motion."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,1947.176,1947.759,"--Well, that--"
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1947.759,1960.387,"The Federal Circuit is borrowing Tenth Circuit's law for this purpose, but the Tenth Circuit's law, as I understand it, has... is the position that was just presented to us by Mr. Stewart."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,1971.45,1976.976,"--Well, Your Honor, going to the Federal Circuit, of course, the meaning of Rule 50 was in dispute."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.901,1985.583,Isn't--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,1985.583,1986.044,--the court.
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1986.044,1988.111,--that the Federal Circuit's own rule?
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2006.997,2010.156,That is the Federal Circuit rule in patent infringement cases.
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.609,2014.819,Borrow--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2014.819,2015.55,--apply the rule of--
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.55,2015.77,--the Tenth Circuit rule.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2015.77,2016.845,--Yes.
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.845,2016.995,Yes.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2032.262,2033.143,Well--
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2033.143,2034.557,"""# what I put in the appendix. """
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2034.557,2042.101,"--certainly, they did have to deal with that, Your Honor, because one of the grounds for appeal was that there as no antitrust standing."
2005.04-597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.766,2067.036,"Yeah, but the... the antitrust standing issue is not the same as the relevant market issue that was decided, is it?"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2067.036,2074.558,"--No, it's not, but it certainly is the same with respect to antitrust injury, and the Federal Circuit found there was no evidence of antitrust injury."
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.61,2094.789,Or as much of the record as the other side wanted to produce.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2094.789,2098.481,"--Well, we have to assume they covered their bases, Your Honor, yes."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.31,2133.415,"I'm looking at the motion that you made, which was not in the first instance for a new trial; it was for a remittitur."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2164.068,2165.242,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.027,2178.53,A new trial on damages... that's all you asked for... not a new trial on liability.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2178.53,2179.213,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.664,2220.477,It--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2220.477,2220.877,--in the end--
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2220.877,2223.465,--it was... the new trial request had to do with liability--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2223.465,2224.176,--Yes.
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2224.176,2226.764,--whether it was for newly discovered evidence or something else.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2242.813,2248.159,"Well, of course, Your Honor, if there were no proof of damages, the whole antitrust claim would fail."
2005.04-597,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2265.783,2267.549,"Well, why... it's... why is that a lesser remedy?"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2291.059,2294.068,"--Well, certainly, Your Honor... let's take another example."
2005.04-597,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2310.699,2312.163,But the problem there is still the same.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2328.511,2344.639,"--Well, it seems to me that it is the principal point of the trilogy that when a motion is made for entry of judgment based on insufficiency of the evidence, that raises the question of whether there ought to be a new trial."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2352.614,2360.769,The principal point was that the Court of Appeals could not enter... direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law if a 50(b) motion had not been made.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2362.033,2362.513,That's--
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2362.513,2363.627,--invoke.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2363.627,2367.338,"--absolutely correct, Your Honor, the trilogy stands for that proposition."
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2401.801,2405.873,Had Rule 59 motions been made in those cases?
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2405.873,2414.368,"--It's not clear from the record, I don't believe, as to all of the cases, Your Honor, but certainly it is clear in the first case, the Cone case, that there was a motion--"
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2414.368,2414.528,Right.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2414.528,2417.977,"--for a new trial, but it was based on different grounds."
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.545,2422.041,"So far, you're halfway into your argument."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2451.388,2456.685,"When you say ""that"", Your Honor, you mean with respect to the... to the new trial or with respect--"
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.685,2458.452,"No, I... I mean, I thought... there are two parts to this."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2474.387,2474.899,--The--
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2474.899,2475.33,"They say,"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2485.018,2486.173,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2508.721,2512.653,"No, it doesn't say it... it is deemed to continue to be pending."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2515.121,2515.752,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2515.752,2516.985,Which is a very different issue.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2524.047,2524.98,"Oh, I agree, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2531.731,2533.667,"No, the issue is reserved."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2548.579,2553.515,"--That's certainly not the way I would read it, Your Honor, because in this case--"
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2553.515,2553.835,How about a--
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2553.835,2555.489,That's the way this Court has read it.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2557.174,2570.324,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, because if the Court... if the rule says that the Rule 50(a) motion can be granted; conversely, it can be denied."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2594.856,2598.439,"--Well, it can't... it can't be... it would be interlocutory at that stage."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2603.494,2607.034,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that would be a most peculiar rule."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2615.631,2627.967,"Yes, but you don't go up on appeal with a final judgment rule, a firm final judgment rule, as there is in the Federal system, from the denial or refusal to act on a 50(a) motion."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2627.967,2628.831,Well--
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2628.831,2629.813,The trial isn't over.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2634.328,2638.48,"--That's certainly correct, Your Honor, there can be no appeal without a final judgment."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2661.799,2669.082,"Well, there is, you know... I mean, this truly is a case where a page of history is worth much more than logic."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2737.146,2738.972,"Yes, that's all correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2760.325,2769.322,"But you don't get it out of that language, because that language is there for the specific purposes of allowing a judge, after their verdict, to enter judgment NOV."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2769.322,2771.379,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2843.284,2845.461,He doesn't enter judgment to trigger the 50(b) motion.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2850.254,2854.728,"--Well, Your Honor, the rule says that it can be made up to 10 days--"
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2854.728,2854.93,Right.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2854.93,2856.444,--after the entry of judgment.
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2870.354,2870.876,But I don't--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2870.876,2871.377,--on account of the defendant.
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2871.377,2886.966,"--I don't follow that, because you... you know, I'm sure, that it's almost routine that... yes, you have the 10 days, the extra 10 days, under the rules... but isn't it almost routine, at a trial, that the verdict loser will say,"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2915.74,2927.054,"Well, I think it's a common practice in those circuits which have indicated that a 50(b) motion is required to preserve all rights to appellate review."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2934.377,2950.296,"Well, it's not a question of what is required or what is permissive, but isn't it to the lawyer's advantage, to the client's advantage, to say to the judge, sooner rather than later,"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,2959.663,2970.397,"--Well, Your Honor, this case may be a little different from some, in that the precise issue that was presented to the Federal Circuit, the failure of proof, was something that was identified very early in the case."
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3021.88,3031.789,"Well, if... should we disagree with you, Mr. Schroeder, on that, you seem to fall back, at the end of the day, on a plain error notion."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3031.929,3032.33,--Well--
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3032.33,3032.65,--that right?
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3032.65,3035.789,"--there are several things that we would fall back on, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3042.821,3044.406,If we don't agree with you on the--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3044.406,3045.369,--On the meaning of--
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3045.369,3045.64,--need for a--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3045.64,3046.1,--the trilogy.
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3046.1,3046.763,--50(b) motion.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3046.763,3047.164,Okay.
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3053.132,3059.161,"Have we ever said that plain error would preserve this, in the civil context?"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3059.161,3060.012,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3061.418,3061.629,"No, I--"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3061.629,3061.919,--on that.
2005.04-597,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3061.919,3062.33,--haven't either.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3062.33,3065.008,It's... there's no precedent that--
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.008,3067.405,"But even if there were, how could this kind of error ever be plain?"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3067.405,3068.257,--Well--
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3068.257,3069.079,"I mean, ever."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3069.079,3069.981,"--Your Honor, I--"
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3069.981,3070.724,If there's no evidence at all.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3086.3,3092.97,"--Well, Your Honor, there was another claim in this case on which Unitherm did recover, which is not before this Court, which was a claim for--"
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.97,3093.833,That has nothing to do with my question.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3093.833,3094.013,--Sure.
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3094.013,3101.967,"You were saying that the mistake was that there was not sufficient evidence that there was injury of an antitrust kind, and that there was a market."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3110.131,3110.845,"Well, there's not--"
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3110.845,3114.344,"Obviously, there's injury, because a patent allows you to raise the price."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3124.145,3136.462,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, first of all, in determining plain error, it's necessary to put it in the context of this case, where that very issue had been raised repeatedly and had, in fact, been ruled on by the court in denying the summary judgment motion."
2005.04-597,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3152.248,3170.633,"What I'm worried about, to put all my cards on the table... if we were to say there is even a possibility of plain error in this case, the plain error exception in the rules would become a monster, wherein complex cases, people who hadn't made the proper motions would all be arguing plain error just as if they had."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3170.633,3175.979,"--Well, certainly the plain error argument is always, in a sense, available, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3186.071,3188.459,"It's an extreme case, because there's insufficient evidence?"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3188.459,3192.188,"It's an extreme case for a number of reasons, and that's certainly one of them."
2005.04-597,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.242,3193.402,"Well, it's--"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3193.402,3193.873,"--evidence, but--"
2005.04-597,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.873,3196.443,--not going to be plain error in every insufficient evidence case.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3196.443,3202.84,"--No, but in... this is a... an... a case in which the insufficiency of the evidence was extremely apparent."
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3203.985,3205.008,"All right, let's assume it's extremely apparent."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3256.872,3265.9,"--Well, Your Honor, certainly where the motion has been made and has, in fact, been briefed, and has been considered by the court, and where you have a situation in which--"
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3265.9,3267.785,"And we have said, ""Don't grant it""."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3267.785,3269.229,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3269.229,3270.795,"And we have said, ""Don't grant it""."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3270.795,3283.734,"Well, Your Honor, I guess we'd go back to the proposition that... I believe that the District Court could grant the 50(a) motion later; it did not have to wait for 50(b) motion."
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3287.055,3290.846,It could do that even after it had ruled upon it and had denied it?
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3290.846,3297.726,"--Well, certainly in situations where the Court simply enters judgment and doesn't deny the motion first, that would be true--"
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3297.726,3297.897,"Well, I--"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3297.897,3298.057,--would be true.
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3298.317,3298.477,--I--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3298.477,3298.898,--even here--
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3298.898,3304.294,"--I will... I will grant you that, were it not for our cases, textually, the argument you make is possible."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3308.67,3322.13,"--Well, Your Honor, I... when it comes to ""overruling a lot of law"", I think that the fundamental fact here is that, in the trilogy, the case was always sent back for a new trial."
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3327.355,3340.956,"Sent back to... for a new trial because the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial, or sent back to the trial court for that court to decide as a matter of that court's discretion, whether to order--"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3340.956,3341.417,--That's correct.
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3342.33,3342.47,--a new trial?
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3342.62,3342.931,--to the District--
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3342.931,3343.291,But it--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3343.291,3343.622,--Court.
2005.04-597,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3343.622,3348.928,"--it was not... but, here, you're asking us to affirm something that a Court of Appeals did."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3348.928,3355.127,"Well, the... the Court of Appeals ruled that the case should go back to the District Court."
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.234,3365.329,"I'm not even sure your argument is so strong on the text, frankly."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3393.142,3394.365,"Well, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3394.365,3395.089,"Why wouldn't it say,"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3402.64,3404.216,Well--
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3404.216,3404.807,"I mean, where--"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3404.807,3405.097,--I--
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3405.097,3412.811,"--and where does it get the power to do these things, in ruling on a motion previously reserved, if it's not set forth there?"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3412.811,3421.506,"--If you look at 50(a), Your Honor, it specifically says that the 50(a) motion can be granted."
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.483,3442.019,"No, I'm talking about the only remedy available after the motion has been reserved, after--"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3442.019,3443.111,Well--
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.111,3445.659,--the court has declined to rule on it once.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3445.659,3455.551,"--Well, if the motion is reserved, and the court has declined to rule on it, then the... it would seem to me that it follows that the court can grant that motion."
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3455.551,3456.604,And that's all.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3456.604,3461.407,"Well, it can also enter judgment, which constitutes another denial--"
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3461.407,3462.861,Can it order a new trial?
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3462.861,3463.414,--Yes.
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3465.029,3465.962,"Where does he get that power, under (a)?"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3465.962,3467.537,--It is a--
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3467.537,3467.707,Unless--
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3467.707,3470.114,--It is a lesser remedy--
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3470.114,3470.355,--Ah.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3470.355,3471.779,"--than the one requested, that was--"
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3471.779,3473.373,"Oh, well, then it shouldn't have been set forth in (b)."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3476.875,3481.277,"--Well, Rule 50(a) doesn't literally say that the motion can be denied."
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3523.353,3523.733,"Yeah, but the--"
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3523.733,3524.296,--instead of interjecting--
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3524.296,3526.591,--rule doesn't deem it to have been deferred.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3551.217,3553.573,"--Well, I would have stopped sooner, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3560.766,3576.181,"Well, that may be, but it's still the case that the rule does not deem the... this rule does not deem, in... terms, the ruling on the pre verdict motion to have been deferred."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3576.181,3582.05,"--Well, Your Honor, it is certainly a common practice that, while the--"
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3582.05,3584.135,I'm asking you about what this rule says.
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3585.699,3591.416,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that if ruling on that motion--"

2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3591.606,3592.036,--had been inferred--
2005.04-597,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3592.036,3593.601,"--want to answer the question, just say so."
2005.04-597,2,40450,robert_a_schroeder,,3593.601,3595.337,"--No, I'm... I'm very pleased to answer the question, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3611.907,3614.946,--Can a judge grant a new trial on a 50(a) motion?

2005.04-597,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3626.06,3628.979,Do you agree on the answer... with the answer to the last question I asked?
2005.04-597,3,17413,burck_bailey,,3632.607,3633.531,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-597,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3633.531,3634.284,I didn't.
2005.04-597,3,17413,burck_bailey,,3634.284,3643.03,"The result ConAgra contends for here, may it please the Court, leads to some really bad results."
