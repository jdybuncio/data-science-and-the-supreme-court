1958.53,0,38771,reeves_bowen,,298.784,309.773,"I don't think that the -- that the -- that there's any detail given about why he was needed for 15 rather than 10 or 20, or any other number."
1958.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,310.835,316.263,But it was specified that his presence in New York was required for 15 days.
1958.53,0,38771,reeves_bowen,,316.263,317.133,That -- that is right.
1958.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,317.133,322.145,That he -- that he was to be made available for a period of 15 days --
1958.53,0,38771,reeves_bowen,,322.145,323.061,That is right.
1958.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,323.061,324.692,-- for the purposes of this investigation which you spoke.
1958.53,0,38771,reeves_bowen,,324.692,327.5,That is -- that is correct.
1958.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,395.285,397.671,At a -- at a proceeding before --
1958.53,0,38771,reeves_bowen,,397.671,397.827,For a --
1958.53,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,397.827,401.872,-- one of the court judges with -- with -- and he was represented by counsel.
1958.53,0,38771,reeves_bowen,,401.872,402.568,"Oh, yes, sir."
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,2938.302,2944.182,Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices.
1958.53,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3294.835,3296.01,"May I ask you, Mr. --"
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3296.01,3297.471,"Yes, sir."
1958.53,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3297.471,3315.545,"Did you see any invalidity in a statute in Florida which was provided, without saying or might incarcerate a witness, proximately about construing (Inaudible) and it was material to an action pending in court?"
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3315.545,3325.276,"Mr. Justice Whittaker, I would be less than frank if I've said that your question has not given me considerable concern before I came here."
1958.53,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3407.458,3413.486,"Even including the ancillary of a reservation, or federal ancillary."
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3413.486,3415.265,"That is correct, sir."
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3478.177,3484.148,What is the source of the power of the Federal Government without a treaty to see fit?
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3489.734,3493.855,"If Your Honor please, my reading of the authorities gives me this answer."
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3523.789,3530.511,(Voice Overlap) because that involve a relation with foreign nation and that's outside of the scope of States.
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3530.511,3531.089,"That's correct, sir."
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3531.089,3541.332,That relation of State to State is within the framework of the union and not outside and not an aptitude of power -- of sovereignty vis-à-vis the rest of the country.
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3541.332,3542.136,"Well, that is correct."
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3542.136,3543.632,(Voice Overlap)
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3543.632,3545.379,I -- I agree with Your Honor.
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3584.128,3598.77,I've put it to you but that question could not have been decided by this Court because there is a provision in the Federal Constitution so we don't know what the part of a statement of -- in vis-à-vis the other States if there had not been the federal -- of constitutional privileges.
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3598.77,3607.701,"Well, I think that Your Honor may be correct in that respect and here's my only reply to you if I may give it to you, sir."
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3692.904,3694.681,May I say to (Inaudible) within --
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3694.681,3694.729,Yes.
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3694.729,3702.039,-- that prior to the Constitution the States really were self-contained separate properties?
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3702.039,3702.538,"Yes, sir."
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3705.836,3711.127,The confederation is -- is a very different thing from the union of -- a more perfect union.
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3711.127,3711.759,That's correct.
1958.53,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3711.759,3712.86,"We can agree on that, can't we?"
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3712.86,3715.299,"Oh, most certainly, we agree wholeheartedly."
1958.53,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3972.421,3976.825,But why do you it's no valid process assuming your other points have no merit?
1958.53,1,34310,l_j_cushman,,3983.434,3999.925,"But I respectfully suggest, Your Honor that under the rule in Pennoyer against Neff and under the rule in every case of which I'm acquainted and -- and maybe to some that I'm not acquainted with, the power and the process of the State cannot run beyond its border."
1958.53,2,38771,reeves_bowen,,6409.032,6410.37,"Yes, sir."
1958.53,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6414.724,6415.482,I beg your pardon?
1958.53,2,38771,reeves_bowen,,6415.482,6431.153,I said I don't think this case is moot because if this Court -- Court of the State of Florida has swung in the balance the question of whether it can collect that bond or not.
