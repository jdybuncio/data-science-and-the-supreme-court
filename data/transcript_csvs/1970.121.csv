1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.083,"We will hear arguments Number 121, Mayberry against Pennsylvania, is the counsel ready?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,33.23,33.518,I’ll try.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,33.518,35.978,Before we recess.
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,35.978,39.853,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,172.184,183.738,"Now, clarify for me if you will Mr. Reitz the relationship of these sentences collectively to the sentence on the substantive charge."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,183.738,193.655,He then proceeded Mr. Chief Justice to sentence on a substantive charge and he gave a sentence for prison breach of 10 years which was the maximum.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.44,202.822,"Now, is that consecutive?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,202.822,205.059,That was also consecutive.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,313.651,323.464,Would say that their conduct was as aggravated as it was with respect to this petitioner?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,323.464,329.161,"In some instances, Your Honor, the conduct I would think would be substantially worse."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,379.711,389.15,"I take it, if you would agree that these were very aggravated episodes of the conduct and utterance, would you not?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,389.15,418.143,"Oh, they would be conduct Your Honor, which from any attorney, I think, would have been thought of as very aggravated in the instance of a layman defending himself, not an educated layman defending himself in a very serious Court with the kind of background from which he comes and the life which he has led, I’m not -- I don’t think I would have put the label aggravated on the verbal contents."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.143,423.618,"Even after repeated, you wouldn’t concede this was aggravated?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,423.618,447.717,"The warnings were repeated Your Honor, but the incidents for example, late in the trial, one of the two-year sentences is imposed for the defendant more or less expostulating an anger after having been prevented from developing a line of questioning that he was not arguing with fools."
1970.121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.706,469.154,"You would concede, I suppose that the conduct of the defendant throughout this trial was fully outrageous, would you not?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,469.154,471.994,It is conduct which we certainly had not condoned.
1970.121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.994,480.97,"I don’t mean every moment of the trial but only -- but that it was continually and quite outrageous, would you?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,482.905,485.907,I would not use the word “outrageous” Your Honor to describe --
1970.121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,485.907,494.389,"When he called the judge “a stumbling dog”, he called him a “son of a bitch”, he called him -- those are the two, that I remember from reading the briefs."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,496.897,497.845,He did indeed.
1970.121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.845,499.136,On Court.
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,499.136,500.994,He had some rather exotic like a --
1970.121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,500.994,504.0,Some very foul language but the --
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,504.0,512.335,I think the level of outrage that one develops in this kind of a case defends a good deal on what one finds the level of expectation from the speaker.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,512.335,522.736,"I think we’ll suspend here, Mr. Reitz."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,522.736,524.212,May it please the Court.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,624.431,631.84,But was it basically any different from the procedural due process that he had in the trial of the substantive charges?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,631.84,634.308,"Oh, indeed Your Honor."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,643.013,646.029,But what he had done about counsel in the substantive case?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,646.029,648.756,"In the substantive case, he had waived counsel."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,649.86,652.647,"Although from that, is that he rejected affirmatively permanently, didn’t he?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,652.647,654.435,He had indeed.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,700.817,704.981,May I ask this Professor Reitz.
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,714.651,717.694,MI think they go together Your Honor.
1970.121,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,843.754,846.939,Is the full record in the Court?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,846.939,847.831,It is indeed Your Honor.
1970.121,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,855.568,857.863,"It’s a long, long trial."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,857.863,867.784,"It was a trial that lasted for 22 trial days for the last day being entirely sentencing, so it is a very long trial."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,905.551,909.346,Wouldn’t that have been somewhat ceremonial here?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,909.346,930.847,"It might indeed had been ceremonial because of the obviously overwrought state of the trial judge with an impartial tribunal, I am not convinced that a fairly substantial argument could not have been made in mitigation of the severity of the conduct."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,930.847,932.462,Of the conduct or the sentence?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,932.462,933.434,Of the conduct.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,933.434,935.835,How could you mitigate the conduct?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,941.895,956.952,"As you study the record Your Honor, I don’t think one would need to approach justification in order to find there were indeed issues of provocation or explanation that might in some way have tempered the fury."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1014.264,1029.285,Suppose that meant that the trial judge simply was taking position that there was no evidence that could bear by way of litigation or explanation of his conduct during the course of the trial.
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1046.92,1047.329,"Yes, sir."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1048.534,1050.544,Yes.
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1065.96,1073.831,"No Your Honor, I have not the slightest doubt that there is an enormous problem here with the severity of the sanction."
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1093.633,1100.206,"Mr. Reitz, suppose we were to agree with this, that you will not-- about position, what we can do about it?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1100.206,1103.434,That’s the major difficulty with the point Your Honor.
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1137.193,1137.805,What would the --
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1137.805,1140.915,"We have many statutory ceilings, none over six months."
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1140.915,1148.519,What would the constitutional provision be to which we've relied?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1148.519,1155.078,"The constitutional provision on which we rely in the brief Your Honor, is the Eighth Amendment, prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment."
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1155.078,1159.71,That’s the only one you think that would be applicable.
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1162.167,1164.009,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1164.938,1165.409,I suppose --
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1165.409,1179.36,One might try to make a substantive due process argument but I don’t think that gives us any greater precision as to the limitations that one could impose through the Constitution on state trial judges.
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1179.5,1184.072,"Well, certainly at least we can do what we did in the Yates, in this case, can’t we?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1184.072,1185.328,Quite right.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1220.33,1236.065,"We decided you were right on the constitutional argument, but what could be the mechanism to deal with it, undertake to deal it with ourselves or to remand it for reconsideration in a calmer atmosphere?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1236.065,1237.92,I think Your Honor.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1273.312,1285.568,"Well, aren’t state courts capable of applying the federal constitutional provision or provisions that you rely on."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1300.205,1322.778,"There’s great virtue to that in some instances and many of the scholars of federal jurisdiction urged that in the ultimate, the only basic safeguard for all constitutional rights are state courts that all federal courts jurisdiction is subject to statutory limitation by Congress."
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1346.383,1359.221,"May I ask Mr. Reitz, does the Pennsylvania Supreme Court have a power comparable to our so-called supervisory power which I guess is what we used in the Yates case?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1365.3,1373.453,"The Pennsylvania courts take a very narrow review, a narrow position on their appellate review sentences generally."
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1385.55,1408.047,Do I correctly infer from Justice Jones’ treatment of the questions as whether the sentences constitute cruel and unusual punishment that that’s the only way this was put to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that they did constitute cruel and unusual punishment?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1408.047,1410.532,"That argument was put, that was not the sole argument put --"
1970.121,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1410.532,1418.302,"Well, I notice the opinion doesn’t seem to address itself to any other basis for the challenge to the sentence."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1422.199,1433.163,"In the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, all of the arguments there before this Court were raised in one fashion or another, Mr. Mayberry there represented himself."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1445.682,1464.474,"Well, Professor Reitz, didn’t Justice O’Brien assume in his separate opinion that there was something in the nature of supervisory power that imposed the duty on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to examine the sentence for the contempt?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1464.474,1468.304,Justice O’Brien relies on a cruel and unusual punishment argument.
1970.121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.329,1512.489,What's your view in the offenses towards this Court?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1512.489,1538.843,I think an argument can be built on the basis of existing data that a maximum of six months is a customary standard that is now so well entrenched by statute and case law that it is the outside limit for a sentence in a contempt case absent a statute permitting a longer one.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.765,1552.585,"If the judge had made all these sentences concurrent one with another, there were 11, weren’t they?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1552.585,1553.335,There were 11.
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.335,1555.669,"If it made him concurrent, would you be here?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1555.669,1556.342,"Yes indeed, Your Honor."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.511,1559.107,"It is two years on each, was it?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1559.107,1581.054,"Two years on each and that is still twice as long as the Yates case which was one year, 11 times concurrently and that is still in my judgment an enormously over broad sentence for the kind of contempt that this record contains."
1970.121,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1601.645,1633.317,"Suppose they had instead of sentencing him for contempt put the charge against him on the legislative enactment which provided that a person who had appeared before the Court in a serious manner as this man here had attempted to stop it, he committed a crime, and tried him, indicted, tried him before a jury, given him a lawyer, given him all the protection that could be afforded."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1642.754,1652.112,If the same sentence were imposed as a result of that and the statute provided for a crime of obstructing justice --
1970.121,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1652.112,1653.588,That’s right.
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1653.588,1655.522,"I would not make the argument, Your Honor."
1970.121,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1657.86,1663.964,"Well, that really is the basis of the complaint, isn’t it, not the cruel and unusual punishment section?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1663.964,1664.223,"Well, Your Honor."
1970.121,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1678.272,1678.909,"Yes, perhaps --"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1678.909,1684.436,"They were insolent, they were discourteous but they were not in any way blocking the advance of the trial."
1970.121,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1684.436,1689.292,"It is treated as contempt, all is just treated as any other crime."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1721.745,1732.805,"If you may Your Honor, I take a very different view if we have a legislature, having faced the question and establishing a statutory parameter to the permissible sentences."
1970.121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1740.258,1745.674,"Well, I suppose, the legislative judgment is to put no limit on it."
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1763.569,1766.195,"Well, Your Honor that statute was passed in 1836."
1970.121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1766.195,1767.197,Whenever it was passed?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1767.197,1779.209,It has not been reviewed since I think all of the statutes in which they do appear statutory maxima have been of more recent vintage in that.
1970.121,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1796.867,1833.094,"What you’re doing is talking about a case with a same judge as a witness to it who is assaulted by, who is guilt (Inaudible), tries the case, is not a separate crime where he is put before another judge where the jury disappears, given a lawyer and given all the protections of due process of law as I understand, what I understand, due process to the one which is a trial in courtroom on unbiased judge in an unbiased jury?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1833.094,1835.996,"I could not agree with you more Your Honor, the requirements --"
1970.121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.996,1859.871,"On the other hand, Mr. Reitz, may I suggest, if in this summary procedure, the conclusion of this trial judge for all of this contemptuous behavior had summarily sentenced the fellow for three days in jail, would you find that objectionable or violation of any constitutional right?"
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1859.871,1861.378,"No, Your Honor, I would not."
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.943,1884.377,Where do you draw the line?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1887.609,1888.79,"Well, I suggested in the --"
1970.121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.79,1889.835,Within the 22 years?
1970.121,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,1889.835,1900.62,"I've suggested in the brief that a place to stop is the place this Court stopped in the Bloom case, in regard to the right to jury trial."
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2206.538,2210.115,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.515,2595.134,"There were two co-defendants, were there Miss Los?"
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2595.134,2596.214,"Yes, they were Your Honor."
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2596.214,2598.021,And were they cited for you?
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2598.212,2599.254,"Yes, there were."
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2611.158,2613.949,"And they were both found guilty of criminal contempt, were they?"
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2613.949,2614.948,"All three of them were, Your Honor."
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2615.206,2618.159,And then what happened to their cases in the Pennsylvania Court?
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2618.159,2620.082,They did not take the cases on appeal.
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2620.082,2620.999,The co-defendants.
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2620.999,2621.549,That is true.
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.549,2623.836,What sort of sentences did they get?
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2623.836,2630.286,They got one to two year sentences precisely as Mayberry had. Only they were not cited for contempt as many times.
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2634.539,2636.918,"So, they got 6 to 12 and 7 to 14 respectively?"
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2636.918,2637.817,I believe that is true.
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.173,2639.599,And no appeal?
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2639.599,2641.957,I do not believe that there was an appeal taken.
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2643.106,2650.487,"Is this very grounded picture you’ve given us, is that what one gets on the record or were you at the trial, Miss Los?"
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2650.487,2650.831,No.
1970.121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2665.85,2667.239,This is in Pittsburgh?
1970.121,1,19423,carol_mary_los,,2667.239,2667.891,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.215,2724.05,There were penitentiary inmates in the back of the courtroom and the judge couldn’t put them out?
