1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.378,"We will hear the arguments next in No. 72-212, United States against Donovan."
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,12.493,15.879,"Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court."
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.73,335.938,As to the inventory notice?
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,335.938,339.757,"As to the inventory notice, that is right."
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,503.136,505.543,And this never did go to trial that it because of District Court (Voice Overlap).
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,505.543,509.329,"Not as to these respondents, they were served."
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,632.478,635.902,"Mr. Frey, in Kahn, Mrs. Kahn?s phone was not being monitored."
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,635.902,636.985,Oh! Yes it was.
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.985,638.203,It was Mr. Kahn?s phone.
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,642.42,646.918,"Well, actually she was at home but the point of our position is that?"
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,646.918,648.416,The daughter too as I remember.
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,648.416,658.617,"Well, that is right and what we are saying is the naming obligation extends to people who are users of the telephone that is being intercepted in the case of a telephone interception."
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,658.617,659.775,(Inaudible) users at the telephones.
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,659.775,661.063,"Certainly, the Kahn family?"
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,661.063,663.096,"No, no I mean in the case we get before us."
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,663.096,664.299,"No, they were not."
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,667.698,672.593,"But they were communicating over the phone being monitored, just as Mrs. Kahn was."
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,672.593,674.302,"Well, yes but the difference."
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,674.302,676.184,Is it the difference on which instruments you use it.
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,676.184,679.504,The difference is on which end of the phone that is when?
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,679.504,681.302,Was there is a statute (Inaudible).
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,681.302,689.817,"I think it does, yes and I intend to get to that."
1976.75-212,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,689.817,699.067,"Just to make one more point clear, Mr. Kahn was away from, no matter whatever it was, the phone was and Mrs. Kahn was one who was home but he was not in the place where..."
1976.75-212,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,699.067,705.125,But it was the phone at the family that is these phones were the phones of the Kahn family.
1976.75-212,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1635.269,1642.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2714.381,2717.722,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1976.75-212,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.926,2743.524,"Could I ask at the outset, suppose there is an application to tap or intercept conversations of Jones phone, over Jones?s phone and there is probable cause to believe Jones is engaged in the some conspiracy."
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2778.005,2780.021,That is exactly our position Mr. Justice White.
1976.75-212,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.021,2789.495,"And I just make sure here, Smith?s conversation, the unknown person, is against any indictment in a criminal case against him."
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2789.495,2796.424,"Assuming no probable cause existed and they did not anticipate the interception of his conversations, that exactly our position, Sir."
1976.75-212,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2796.424,2807.515,"And there does not seem to be any argument about that in the cases, that the conversation is between the target and Smith are admissible against them both."
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2807.515,2837.964,"I believe that is correct, Your Honor and Your Honor, I might say that there is no question, but that the government had probable cause that these three respondents were in fact engaging in this type of activity that was under investigation and that their conversations would in fact be intercepted and they had this knowledge prior to the application of December 26, 1972 when the government applied for an extension of the original wiretap."
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.071,2895.836,Would you please tell me why a known criminal is entitled to more protection than an unknown criminal?
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2895.836,2918.808,"Mr. Justice Marshall, one might say that when the government is seeking a course of search and seizure which is this is, they were searching and seizing the conversations of Buzzacco, Donovan, and Robbins and they have probable cause to believe that these men will be intercepted and they are violating the law, they have such an obligation of at least naming them by way of statute and by way of?"
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2918.808,2922.303,And that would go to man who is calling from Paris?
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2922.303,2925.285,If they have the probable cause to believe that he would be calling.
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2925.285,2927.818,Or king of Africa?
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2927.818,2930.167,If they sought to bring him within the process of laws of United States.
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2930.167,2931.637,Any place in the world?
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2931.637,2932.703,I believe so sir.
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.703,2934.884,If he is a known criminal?
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2934.884,2937.495,If they have probable cause to believe that he was engaging in this activity.
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2937.495,2943.316,The best way to get the protection of our government is to be known as a criminal.
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2943.316,2944.516,Quite the contrary sir.
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.917,2979.766,"Do you mean that anybody that writes a letter to the government and says I am a bookmaker, he then is protected from then on."
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2979.766,2980.697,Quite the contrary sir.
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2991.349,2997.725,"But if you send that letter and they do not name you and they intercept your message, you go free."
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,2997.725,2999.582,So long as that they?
1976.75-212,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.582,3001.647,So long as you send the letter.
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,3001.647,3012.54,"Well, Your Honor, I think it would have to be somewhat more descriptive then I am a bookmaker."
1976.75-212,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3012.54,3025.728,"You are correctly saying that the test is whether at the time the government had probable cause to believe there was a particular person who is not named, was involved in the criminal activity."
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,3025.728,3027.194,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-212,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3027.194,3034.201,"Whether he was a well-known or totally unknown person before that, it would make no difference, probable cause is the key, is that right?"
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,3034.201,3035.704,That is correct sir.
1976.75-212,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.248,3039.014,At that time!
1976.75-212,2,19769,carmen_a_policy,,3039.014,3050.613,"At that time, at the time that they were seeking the application to be approved was in fact probably engaging in this type of activity and his conversation would be intercepted."
1976.75-212,3,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3405.346,3407.381,I do not have anything further.
1976.75-212,4,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3407.381,3414.08,I have a couple.
