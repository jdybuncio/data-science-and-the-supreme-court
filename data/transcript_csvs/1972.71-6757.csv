1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.779,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-6757, Fontaine against the United States."
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,60.932,61.751,Mr. Chief Justice --
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,61.751,66.466,"We’re running, as you know, a little over and we’ll hope that you will move right along with your argument."
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,66.466,68.402,"I’ll do my best, Your Honor."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,520.424,525.949,Don’t you think that cleared up whatever ambiguity troubled you about the first fact?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,525.949,532.221,"I think not, Your Honor because all the Court does is ask the defendant, do you understand that and the rights you have there under?"
1972.71-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.136,801.138,Isn’t that a fair intimation of the judge’s comment you have got to know so?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,801.138,812.277,"I think it would probably be fair to say, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that something would depend on how -- what kind of tone of voice the trial judge said, “You got to know so.”"
1972.71-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.312,842.525,But the whole proceeding statement of the Court was addressed to the availability of counsel and not to the plea of guilty.
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,849.466,862.727,"That’s really true Mr. Justice, but it’s never made clear that powerfully that by entitled to be represented by an attorney, the Court meant, an attorney right here now, at this guilty plea."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,979.348,986.375,"Mr. Umin, are the matters on the bottom half of page five and six irrelevant to the points you’re making now?"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,986.375,986.976,"Yes, they are."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,986.976,989.465,HIs detailed description of the crime?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,989.465,999.51,I would submit Your Honor that that the description of the crime is entirely relevant to the question of waiver of counsel but I would also quarrel with the suggestion that it was a detailed description of the crime.
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,999.51,1000.773,You said it’s entirely irrelevant?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1000.773,1004.121,"Yes, for the question of whether a man knows whether you have got a lawyer or not."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1004.121,1011.103,Does it have any bearing on the question of his own evaluation of his need for a lawyer?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1011.103,1012.891,"I think not, Your Honor."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1034.352,1037.244,"But by his own statement, he’s done all of these things."
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1040.326,1045.888,"He never specifically says he had a gun and indeed he doesn’t really give a narrative of any kind, Your Honor."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1071.968,1072.279,It only goes [Voice Overlap].
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1072.279,1080.819,"Though it’s the kind of acknowledgment, I might add, that you would expect from someone who was coerced, it's the response to fairly abstract questions about a bank robbery."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1080.819,1087.063,"What’s abstract about the question “And by the use of a gun, a pistol, right?”"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1092.304,1093.744,I don’t see that question here Your Honor but did you --
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1093.744,1099.618,"[Voice Overlap] way down, “And by the use of a gun.”"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1099.618,1104.095,"Oh, quite right and by the use of the gun pistol, right."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1105.58,1116.303,"Then he repeated that by going from the abstract, if you want to describe it that way to the concrete, he said, “What did you do on October 8?”"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1133.283,1153.938,"One of the things this plea proceeding does not include and which I believe is in response to your question also is that federal crime requires that it'd be a federal bank and for that purpose although it may have been used but I don’t mean, perhaps I should recede to some extent from the notion that the statement of what you did on a given day is wholly irrelevant to your need for a counsel."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1153.938,1159.072,Do you question whether -- do you now question whether it was or was not a federal bank?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1159.072,1163.343,"I don’t question it, Your Honor, but I have no idea whether it was or wasn’t a federal bank."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1164.743,1167.433,Are you sure that it’s not a federal--
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1167.433,1168.943,"Federally insured bank, right."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1217.182,1226.269,I suppose your observations would also relate to his response when he explained why he was tendering a guilty plea on this next page.
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1234.39,1242.632,"Indeed, it would, Your Honor because that language suggests that the defendant may have confused a plea of guilty with a plea for mercy."
1972.71-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1275.416,1280.541,Is there anything in the record of what the US attorney told him?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1280.541,1284.474,Only the abstract statements at the beginning but even if we had --
1972.71-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.474,1290.633,"Obviously, they had been together and they had been discussing it because they already had two waivers signed, right?"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1290.633,1292.776,At least the US attorney had been with him.
1972.71-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1305.527,1309.032,This declares probably one-sided plea bargaining?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1309.032,1313.324,"One-sided plea bargaining, if any plea bargaining at all."
1972.71-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.587,1320.709,"There’s not been a record on it, just assumptions that a plea can make?"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1320.709,1321.904,"Just assumptions, pardon me?"
1972.71-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1321.904,1328.709,There is nothing in the record that the US Attorney discussed this case outside of the Court with the petitioner?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1328.709,1329.815,None in terms of plea bargain.
1972.71-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.227,1409.181,"You say that after he was arrested, was he is taken before by commissioner or--?"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1409.181,1412.88,He alleges that he was not Your Honor and the United States Attorney never denied it.
1972.71-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.195,1422.496,But he was government's bound over?
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1422.496,1423.51,I don’t know what happened.
1972.71-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.758,1446.709,Information (Inaudible)
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1446.709,1451.284,"Ultimately, yes, an information substituted for a grand jury indictment."
1972.71-6757,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.962,1471.087,"And the record does show that during part of that period, he was in the hospital?"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1471.087,1471.846,Yes.
1972.71-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.693,1847.961,"Mr. Umin, was the District Judge that heard, the Judge Kathlan (ph) who wrote the opinion in habeas corpus, was he the sentencing judge?"
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1847.961,1853.528,"Yes, he was, Your Honor."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1867.561,1873.263,"Doesn’t the statute require that if he’s available, they have the same judge."
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1873.263,1874.347,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.461,1876.422,Then maybe it’s just the practice.
1972.71-6757,0,42193,steven_m_umin,,1876.422,1890.399,I think it frequently is. Finally the Government argues that the files and records of this case conclusively show in effect that the petitioner was a liar and they alleged that it took them 18 months to file a petition under 2255.
1972.71-6757,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.121,2044.079,"Thank you, Mr. Umin."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2056.407,2060.61,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.459,2153.691,Is there anything in the record indicating whether he was taken before the commissioner?
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2153.691,2155.731,"No, there is not and I would suggest that we --"
1972.71-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.731,2160.169,When do you have to waive a --
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2160.169,2160.365,When do you have to --
1972.71-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.365,2164.714,You have to go and say you to waive it in open court.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2164.714,2166.757,"Well, he did waive it in open court here."
1972.71-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.871,2170.822,I know that was before his arraignment.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2170.822,2183.448,"Well, the arraignment, the guilty plea hearing is called the arraignment in the record."
1972.71-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.448,2185.362,"Well, I understand that."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2185.362,2189.676,"And that’s the point when he waived it, and we submit that it is a --"
1972.71-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.676,2192.936,"Well, but it wasn't waived before that?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2192.936,2199.361,"Well, there is some ambiguity at least in my mind as to when he signed this waiver."
1972.71-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.947,2221.306,"Well, normally if defendant would have been taken before a commissioner where he would have been advised of the charges against him and also advised that he could apply for counsel at that time?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2221.306,2233.287,"Well, I would suggest that the -- it appears from the record that he was arrested by Michigan -- Detroit Police and it may not have been until sometime after he was in custody."
1972.71-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.672,2256.741,The federal charge.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2256.741,2260.127,Under federal charge.
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2260.127,2265.128,How long was he with the US Attorney?
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2265.128,2285.819,"Well, what we had is simply what Mr. Umin read to you at the beginning of the guilty plea hearing where he says he has been given a copy of the information, he acknowledges that he understands it and knows what the maximum penalty is and it says, “He informs me that he wants to waive counsel.”"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2285.819,2303.853,"Do I gather from that that if that period of time and nobody knows how long it was, this man was in the presence of the US Attorney and nobody else and the only legal advice he was getting was from the US Attorney, am I right?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2303.853,2306.918,"At the beginning, you mean, immediately prior to the proceedings --"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.918,2310.216,"Do you know how long it was before, you don’t!"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2310.216,2310.635,"No, we don’t."
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2310.635,2312.456,I don’t either.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2322.031,2322.662,That’s right.
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.638,2339.576,He just did not waive these two things he signed?
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2339.576,2341.389,There’s no indication that he --
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.389,2344.373,"Well, you know he didn’t."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2344.373,2345.965,"But, he said he --"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.965,2349.26,"Well, he didn’t have the blanks, did he?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2349.26,2351.775,The US Attorney obviously provided the blanks --
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.775,2352.096,That’s right.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2352.096,2353.678,-- and gave him the opportunity --
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.678,2354.341,And that was his [Voice Overlap].
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2354.341,2355.18,-- to waive counsel.
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2362.367,2368.333,"Well, you don’t, you don’t think as to the kind of the legal (Voice Overlap)."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2368.333,2373.437,"Well, I’m not [Attempt to Laughter] no and we don’t contend that this amounts to a counsel."
1972.71-6757,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2373.437,2386.252,But his claim is that and was never been proven one way or the other because there hasn’t been any hearing is that he was getting a good deal of advise to use euphemism from the policemen in the --
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2386.252,2389.945,"Well, that -- and that is what I’d like to come to now."
1972.71-6757,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2390.54,2393.624,Along with brutality and coercion?
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2393.624,2428.549,"We suggest and it’s our basic position that where this is substantial period of time between the alleged acts of coercion and the guilty plea that then unless there are some very specific objective, allegations of objective facts as to why those acts of coercion taint the plea that in that situation it’s reasonable to expect the defendant to answer truthfully to the Court’s questions at the guilty plea hearing as to whether there were any threats or promises."
1972.71-6757,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.256,2679.915,"Well, I have forgotten, was this a pro se petition at that stage?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2679.915,2681.034,Yes.
1972.71-6757,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2681.034,2686.217,"Well then, that would – I have to say that it wouldn’t be very crucial, wouldn't it?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2686.217,2687.472,"Well, if the --"
1972.71-6757,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.472,2693.674,Haven’t we treated the pro se petition as merely the mechanism to get the man into the courtroom?
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2693.674,2704.998,"Well, there still is a requirement that the petition set forth facts which if true would entitle him to relief and there’s a requirement that it be set forth with some specificity."
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.891,2827.089,"Is that taken into consideration at all, the point I’ve been trying to -- we don’t know anything that happened to that man from the time he was picked up by the State until he walked in with the US Attorney."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2827.089,2829.115,"Well, we know he was in the hospital."
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2829.115,2829.965,A part of the time.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2829.965,2834.424,We know he was in custody.
1972.71-6757,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.328,2845.017,"But the record, however contains very serious allegations as to what happened during that [Voice Overlap]."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2845.017,2846.5,It contains very serious allegations.
1972.71-6757,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2846.5,2850.806,"And absolutely no answer to them, no denial of them?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2850.806,2857.908,Yes but we suggest that it’s -- that the allegations are defective in one critical point.
1972.71-6757,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2889.459,2901.504,"I understood your brief to say to concede that if what he alleges is true then of course his plea with coerced, but you simply say they’re incredible, the allegation is incredible?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2901.504,2902.536,"No, I’m not saying."
1972.71-6757,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2909.145,2909.54,True.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2909.54,2910.921,"Correct, whether they are true."
1972.71-6757,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2910.921,2912.206,Certainly if they --
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2912.206,2928.07,"But we also say that that where you are specifically asked in open court at a time and place removed from the acts of coercion, you’re specifically asked by a judge in a Rule 11 hearing, “Were there any acts of coercion?"
1972.71-6757,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2930.388,2953.329,"Well, you are saying therefore that his allegations are incredible, not true, but I thought that you had concede it and certainly I’m surprised that if you didn’t that if what he said happened to him and if in fact, everything he said in the courtroom was coerced because of police brutality, I would have thought that you would concede it that that made the so called a [Voice Overlap]."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2953.329,2962.287,"Well, we don’t concede that and I would suggest that a reading of our brief shows that we do make the two arguments."
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2980.22,2982.438,"Now, does he know what a threat or a promise is?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2997.268,2999.269,"Well, that’s correct but the whole purpose of Rule 11 --"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.269,3006.042,"Well, there shouldn’t somebody be there to hold his hand?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3006.042,3013.33,"Well, we’re not suggesting that that would not be a better procedure, that if someone was there and that he obviously isn’t --"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.33,3018.98,"Well, this Court, I understand has said that plea bargaining is alright."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3030.411,3030.765,"Well, he did --"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3030.765,3037.75,There’s no question the US Attorney talked to him and I don’t know what the US Attorney told him?
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3037.75,3043.744,"Well, all I can say is that the -- he did and I will come to this point in a moment."
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3052.782,3055.903,Did he sign a waiver of counsel with the US Attorney?
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3055.903,3056.701,Did he sign one?
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3056.701,3058.499,Yes.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3058.499,3060.808,"Well, he signed a waiver of counsel and I think the record indicates --"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.808,3064.274,"So, he waived it before he got to the judge, is that right?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3064.274,3068.033,That’s right and the judge referred to that fact --
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3068.033,3072.339,"Well, I mean, is a waiver outside of the Court a good waiver?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3072.339,3073.922,"Well, it’s not even clear it’s outside of the Court."
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3077.286,3084.139,As I understood the US Attorney walked in with him and said I have these in my hand.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3084.139,3085.713,"Well, there is no indication he walked in."
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3095.193,3105.902,"Well, if he waived all his rights in his one-sided advice from the US Attorney, then he is bound by it?"
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3105.902,3109.073,"Well, not when -- we believe that the judge then went on --"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3109.073,3112.159,But did the Court say you could disregard that?
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3112.159,3113.54,"Well, I think that is --"
1972.71-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.54,3115.267,Understood.
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3115.267,3122.612,"Yes, we believe the record-- the fair inference from the record is that that he was offering counsel at the present time."
1972.71-6757,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3131.035,3155.904,"Doesn’t your -- don’t you have to bear the burden here now of meeting the statutory standard which I think is in terms that unless on the face of the record, it conclusively appears then you have to bear the burden of showing that this transcript of this interrogation under Rule 11 conclusively shows that none of these things could be true."
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3158.601,3163.367,Well we know the statutory standard is --
1972.71-6757,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3163.367,3167.622,How else can the District Judge avoid the hearing unless he makes the finding as --
1972.71-6757,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3167.622,3171.429,"Well, our basic contention, it’s a two-fold contention."
1972.71-6757,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3483.958,3484.648,Thank you gentlemen.
