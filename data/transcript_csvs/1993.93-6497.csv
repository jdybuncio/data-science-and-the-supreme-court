1993.93-6497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.075,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-6497, Frank McFarland v. James A. Collins."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,65.645,74.517,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.489,107.707,"When did he ask that, counsel?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,107.707,110.955,"--He made the request on October 22nd, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.955,121.264,That was how long after the petition for certiorari had been denied from his original conviction?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,121.264,125.95,"It was denied June 6th, so it was approximately 4 months, 4-1/2 months."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.95,131.338,Why did it take that long to worry about the counsel problem?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,131.338,137.414,"Well, I'm sure that Mr. McFarland worried about the counsel problem the entire period of time, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.414,140.741,Did the Texas Resource Center worry about it?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,140.741,143.083,"Yes, sir, we worried a great deal about it."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.083,148.924,"And what was it, 5 days before his execution you came in with this motion?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,148.924,149.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.668,170.166,"And you didn't see the problem arising until 5 days before the execution, having already gotten one extension of the execution, right?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,170.166,175.586,"Your Honor, we did see the problem arising, and we were worried about the problem."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,181.615,183.784,How many lawyers do you have at the Texas Resource Center?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,183.784,190.064,"--At this time, Your Honor, we have 18, and there are 376 people on death row."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.545,202.465,But this was a man who had been scheduled to be executed in mid-September.
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,212.633,215.586,"No, Your Honor, we did not wait until 5 days before."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.186,237.623,It was not.
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,237.623,238.264,No.
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.264,240.902,There were so many easy ways to avoid it.
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,245.167,257.63,"The Texas Resource Center, or the lawyers at the Texas Resource Center consider the recruitment of counsel for people on death row to be an enormous and important responsibility."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.785,268.891,"Counsel, I am circuit justice for the Fifth Circuit, as you know, and the Texas Resource Center comes in at the last minute regularly."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,268.891,283.901,"--Your Honor, we do come in at the last minute if the last minute is... if you're talking about shortly before an execution date, but we try to come in earlier."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.357,354.528,Eighteen lawyers and you?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,354.528,359.339,"--I can't remember if some of those lawyers... one or two has come on since then, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.443,377.411,"Ms. Welch, don't waste anymore of your argument time on this."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,390.529,391.373,"I understand, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.373,391.669,Try harder.
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,391.669,411.302,Respondent took the position in the court below that the court did not have jurisdiction over this matter because Frank McFarland had not yet filed a legally sufficient habeas petition.
1993.93-6497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.292,448.194,"Ms. Welch, you said that the petitioner here had not filed... that the reason for the court's denial was he had not filed a legally sufficient habeas petition."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,450.505,450.896,No.
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,472.339,474.558,Did he ask for a stay at the same time?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,474.558,490.209,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, he asked for a stay in order to have a lawyer appointed, and so that that lawyer could do what was necessary to file the petition that was needed under the State's position to invoke the court's jurisdiction."
1993.93-6497,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,490.209,502.718,"Just to clarify, when the district court did finally obtain counsel for McFarland... I think that was on the very eve of execution... then counsel did file a pleading entitled, petition for writ of habeas corpus, did he not?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,502.718,505.155,"That's not... I mean, the court did not obtain counsel."
1993.93-6497,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,527.287,531.347,"But he then did file a petition, did he not?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,531.347,531.565,He did.
1993.93-6497,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,534.768,540.08,"And the district court xx denied the stay based upon the merits of an incomplete petition, right?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,540.08,540.75,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,540.75,543.609,And a divided panel then issued the stay.
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,543.609,559.353,"Well, this Court issued a stay at the same time on the petition for certiorari from the lower... from the district court and the Fifth Circuit's denial of the appointment of counsel and stay motion in the first proceeding."
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.784,618.095,"It isn't clear that the State agrees, is it?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,618.095,623.67,"--You're right, Justice O'Connor, it's not agreed that they concede it."
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,632.247,644.068,"In any event, you take the position that 848 does allow the appointment of counsel by the court prior to the filing of a petition for habeas?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,644.068,645.475,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.703,675.509,"It does have language of, in any post conviction proceeding under 2254 or 2255 the appointment can be made, but you think that doesn't limit it to--"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,675.509,680.46,"--No, and in paragraph... I can't find it."
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,706.215,715.899,"--And the district court in the Fifth Circuit in this case, what is the position, now, on that point, the appointment of counsel?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,715.899,728.971,"They did not... the Fifth Circuit did not specifically address the right to counsel, but the district court specifically refused to appoint counsel, apparently relying upon the jurisdictional bar that respondents urge."
1993.93-6497,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,728.971,753.946,"Would it be simpler to take the position that a proceeding does require the filing of a petition, but that in order to give effect to the statutory counsel guarantee, it would be an abuse of discretion to act on the pro forma petition before the appointed lawyer has had time to investigate and to amend, if the lawyer sees fit?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,753.946,782.153,"I think that that would just... yes, Justice Souter, I think that would certainly address the problem that Frank McFarland was faced with and that is being presented to the Court, but only if it is clear to the inmate that an insufficient petition does not invoke the court's jurisdiction and insofar as it requires the Barefoot standard to be met."
1993.93-6497,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,782.153,782.481,That's right.
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,798.444,820.794,"Yes, Justice Souter, but in addition to that, I think it is important to note that Barefoot paid a lot of attention to the fact that in that case he had had competent counsel throughout the proceedings, and to some extent both the Fifth Circuit and this Court relied upon that in approving the standards that have since become the--"
1993.93-6497,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,820.794,821.621,"No, I realize that."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,861.762,863.901,"--I absolutely agree with you, Justice Souter."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.703,890.203,What jurisdiction?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,926.095,938.918,"--Yes, Your Honor, but Congress also recognized that in order for a death row inmate to articulate an error sufficiently to benefit from habeas corpus review, a lawyer is necessary."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.918,943.025,"To help him prosecute his claim of error, but he has to have a claim of error."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,952.334,971.701,"Your Honor, I do think that that is what Congress said, that a lawyer is required in order to assist a death row inmate in identifying those claims which must be reviewed by habeas corpus in order to provide an effective remedy for people who are sentenced to death in violation of the Constitution."
1993.93-6497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,971.701,993.411,"Well, of course, the further question is the authority to issue a stay, and turning your attention to Justice Souter's suggestion that a skeletal petition be filed, is that consistent with Rule 4 of the habeas rules, which requires that a petition be dismissed unless it appears on its face that there's a probability of relief?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,993.411,1006.203,"I think that it could conflict with Rule 4 if Rule 4 is construed as an absolute, automatic bar to proceeding, but that is not what Rule 4 is, nor what it was intended."
1993.93-6497,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1020.322,1032.037,"So if it plainly appears from the facts of the petition that he's not entitled to relief, nevertheless it would be an abuse of discretion to dismiss it in a death case."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1032.037,1043.828,"Your Honor, I think that it would be an abuse of discretion to determine from that pleading whether or not someone is clearly entitled, or clearly not entitled."
1993.93-6497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1043.828,1050.42,Or would you say that you could not determine from the pleading whether or not he is clearly entitled?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1050.42,1051.311,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1059.135,1072.114,"And would this apply in... just in death cases, because that's the only time in which counsel are appointed under the statute, or would you extend this rule to any habeas petition in Federal courts?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1072.114,1072.333,--No.
1993.93-6497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.755,1078.065,The Federal court is sort of a filing cabinet until the petition is fleshed out?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1078.065,1078.767,"--No, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1092.403,1099.26,"Yes, but you're interpreting Rule 4 saying it's an abuse of discretion to dismiss until counsel has been obtained."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1099.26,1105.289,--But that is because of the intent expressed by Congress in 848.
1993.93-6497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1127.201,1147.896,"Is it essentially your argument that 848 contemplates that there will be a lawyer-drawn petition, and not that there will be a petition... that the petition will be drawn pro se by the prisoner, so that it is 848 that would inform everything else and would take precedence over any rule?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1165.138,1165.685,Yes.
1993.93-6497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1165.685,1177.977,"But that's... you're reading 848 to say, not only are you entitled to counsel in a capital proceeding, but you are entitled to counsel to draw your habeas petition."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1177.977,1179.18,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.617,1181.023,Why do you do that?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1192.284,1224.334,"--Yes, but if you take into account the need for a lawyer, and the difference between the right to a lawyer, the discretionary right to a lawyer under 3006A and that mandatory right to a lawyer under 848, it makes no sense to create a situation where a pro se habeas petitioner would go into court, ask for a lawyer, be executed because his petition was inadequate, regardless of whether or not he had any claims that a lawyer could have presented and obtained relief on."
1993.93-6497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.599,1243.092,"Ms. Welch, your opponents say that the Pennsylvania case, or our case of Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections v. U.S. Marshall's, militates against your contention that the All Writs Act is available to you."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1244.466,1251.135,That case involved issuing of... is it issuing of subpoenas?
1993.93-6497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.744,1253.697,"Subpoenas ad testificandum, yes."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1253.697,1253.947,--Right.
1993.93-6497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1263.131,1266.646,Isn't there a specific statute dealing with stays--
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1266.646,1275.407,"--There is a specific statute dealing with stays, and if you interpret it as we do, it gives the court jurisdiction when a request for counsel is filed."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.367,1315.344,"--Well, you know, if you're reading things into section 848 simply because fairness or logic requires it, why do you have to read into it that a stay of execution would be available?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1340.318,1347.442,"Your Honor, the question before this Court is whether or not the Court has jurisdiction to stay an execution--"
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.442,1347.69,To stay.
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1347.69,1355.86,--when it's necessary in order to appoint counsel and protect its habeas review over claims that are then presented in a counsel petition.
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.86,1384.457,"And what I'm suggesting is that your necessity argument that 848 must operate even before a meritorious habeas petition has been filed, that argument only carries you to the point where you have to allow them to file it within a reasonable time before a stay of execution is necessary, but not 5 days before, that requires Federal courts to stay the process of State justice."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1384.457,1392.063,"I don't agree with you, Justice Scalia, and I don't think that it's necessary to read the stay provisions into 848."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.008,1426.424,"But its jurisdiction comes from 848, and if 848 only guarantees that you get counsel if you apply in a timely fashion and not when you decide 5 days before your execution that there may be something wrong, although you can't really state anything wrong."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1426.424,1428.627,Your Honor--
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.627,1433.094,"We have to go back to 848, it seems to me, whether you use the All Writs Act or not."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1433.094,1453.959,"--There may be circumstances where a death row inmate so abuses the process and so toys with the court and so ignores available processes that it would not be an abuse of discretion to deny a stay or to deny counsel, but those issues are not before this Court."
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1453.959,1463.55,"Well, Ms. Welch, when is the earliest time in this case that you think 848 would have allowed the appointment of counsel?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1463.55,1470.953,"It's... because of the uncertainty about the provisions, Your Honor, it is really difficult for me to say."
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1474.763,1482.589,Can you look back and say there is some time after which this request could have been made?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1482.589,1494.475,"--After the State court refused to appoint counsel, or after this, and also refused to allow additional time for other measures to be taken that might have provided counsel."
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1494.475,1494.725,When was that?
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1494.725,1502.065,"That was October 22nd, when the Court of Criminal Appeals denied our request to order the State court to appoint counsel."
1993.93-6497,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1502.065,1507.859,"And you say no, it would not have been possible to have asked for counsel before that date under 848?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1507.859,1517.7,"Well, that was the position that we had taken that we should pursue all available State remedies for counsel."
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.7,1520.293,"Excuse me, you didn't ask the court to appoint counsel until October 22nd."
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1522.917,1523.667,No.
1993.93-6497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.929,1574.864,"Well, whatever the reason for not asking may have been, the fact is that you did not ask for State appointment of counsel until October 22nd, isn't that right?"
1993.93-6497,0,36865,mandy_welch,,1574.864,1575.004,That is... no.
1993.93-6497,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.246,1598.401,"Very well, Ms. Welch."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1600.167,1606.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1993.93-6497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1659.736,1665.092,"Ms. Griffey, what is your position now on this section 848?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1679.587,1682.539,No. 848(q)(4)(B)--
1993.93-6497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1682.539,1684.991,You think it is not open to that interpretation?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1684.991,1686.944,--I think it is not open to that interpretation.
1993.93-6497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.944,1692.753,"Some of the amici supporting your views in the case take a different view, do they not?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1692.753,1693.284,One did.
1993.93-6497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1693.284,1693.815,Yes.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1693.815,1701.36,The amicus of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation took the position that counsel could be appointed beforehand.
1993.93-6497,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1702.421,1718.431,"Of course, normally, you would expect if the habeas petition were going to be prepared properly that some advance preparation might be required by counsel and possibly investigators."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1718.431,1721.617,--That is not what Congress provided for.
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.136,1777.625,"Do you think that if the petitioner, prisoner himself, files the habeas petition and then requests counsel, that it is within the discretion of the Court to dismiss the habeas petition based on a review of just what the prisoner has put, or does a court properly exercise its discretion by refusing to dismiss the petition until the attorney has looked at it?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1777.625,1782.311,I think that is entirely within the court's discretion.
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.185,1791.745,"You do not think it would be an abuse of discretion for the court to dismiss the writ, thereby ending the proceeding?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1791.745,1810.144,"--I think if there is a petition before the court that raises constitutional basis for relief, then under 848(q), that petitioner is entitled to the appointment of counsel, but he may not be entitled to the appointment of... to the stay of execution unless he raises a substantial showing of the denial of a Federal right upon which relief might be granted."
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1810.144,1814.062,"Oh, but you even say that before you can get counsel the petition has to have some merit."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1814.062,1825.31,"Under Rules 2 and Rules 3 and 2242, yes, it does, otherwise the district clerk of the court is entitled to not file that petition."
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1825.31,1828.058,So the critical document is the filing of the initial petition?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1828.058,1829.761,"Or application, yes."
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.761,1835.415,And Congress you think intended our... an interpretation that the critical document be filed without counsel?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1835.415,1839.491,That is what Congress wrote.
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1839.491,1853.297,"Ms. Griffey, is there any ambiguity at all... what sense does it make to attribute to Congress the purpose of having an inadequate petition filed?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1875.321,1884.925,"I think you have to judge what Congress intended by the language that is in that statute, and it refers to a post conviction proceeding under 2254."
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1903.355,1923.254,"Is it your position that this statute is plain on its face, that the statute requires the pro se petitioner, himself, to file the pleading, the essential pleading that is going to govern the case, and does not give him a right to counsel for that pleading?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1923.254,1926.971,Not with respect to the filing of the initial pleading.
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1937.919,1940.216,Is the request for counsel a part of the proceeding?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1940.216,1941.543,No.
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1943.152,1946.119,The request for counsel is not a part of the proceeding?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1946.119,1949.181,--If it comes after the filing of an--
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1949.181,1951.336,"If it comes after, it is a part of the proceeding?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1951.336,1959.785,"--It is incidental to the proceeding, such as a hearing would be, or any of the other rules pertaining to Federal habeas review that--"
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.785,1962.706,"If it's incidental to the proceeding, then it's part of the proceeding?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,1987.337,2001.019,"--If Congress intended to do that, they did not do that, and it is a well-established rule of statutory construction that the court will not provide what Congress intended to do but presumably by one theory or another omitted by inadvertence."
1993.93-6497,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.019,2022.604,"But isn't it equally incumbent on us to construe our procedural rules in such a way that it does not turn congressional statutes into dead letters, and if we continue to construe the procedural requirements as it seems to me you are asking us to do, then 848 was a waste of everyone's time."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2059.792,2074.099,The only way that 848(q) is turned into procedural farce by... under that scenario would be if the petitioner waits until the last minute to file whatever it is--
1993.93-6497,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2074.099,2074.317,No.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2128.748,2131.512,--There is no abuse of discretion there.
1993.93-6497,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2131.512,2133.762,"Okay, then 848 is a farce."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2133.762,2144.539,"848(q) could... the protection that would be given to a defendant under those circumstances would be, needless to say, if they came in at the last minute--"
1993.93-6497,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2144.539,2144.93,No.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2189.194,2190.209,"--Yes, I am saying that."
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2212.871,2217.744,"Is it right that this Gosch case, that applies without regard to the time of the petition?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2238.939,2254.542,"Yes, that can happen, but underlying all this concern is the assumption that Federal habeas review is somehow indispensable to the State's valid imposition of a death sentence, and it simply is not."
1993.93-6497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.352,2274.237,"You're saying it's perfectly rational for the Federal Government to say, where you've come forward with a good claim, we'll give you counsel to help you, but where there's no good claim, we do not provide counsel to engender a claim."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2292.339,2294.76,I don't remember exactly how it was delineated there.
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.735,2334.12,"The practice they described, as I understand it they would file a perfunctory petition which recited one claim that had been raised on direct appeal, knowing that there might be more there, but then routinely there was no opposition to a stay, as long as there was a claim stated that had been--"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2334.12,2334.822,--That's correct.
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.822,2337.258,--But that all changed after the Gosch case.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2337.258,2342.443,That changed... that was not the procedure that was followed in Gosch.
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2357.673,2376.585,"But wasn't... McFarland's situation was that if Gosch was going to apply in his case, and he filed just this rudimentary petition, he was at grave risk of having it thrown out, because it would not have been a well-pleaded complaint, and then not being able to come with a counseled petition?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2376.585,2377.976,--That--
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2377.976,2381.974,Wasn't he... that was a real risk for him.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2381.974,2398.812,"--That was his risk in Federal court, but underlying McFarland's claims here is the assumption that somehow the procedure fell down in the first instance in the Texas courts because Texas does not routinely and regularly with a uniform procedure provide for the appointment of counsel."
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2398.812,2399.984,That had to do with the timing of it.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2440.031,2454.946,"Habeas jurisdiction is conditioned upon there being errors of constitutional dimension identified, and the factual support for those set forth in an application, and Congress has not changed its delineation of a Federal habeas proceeding."
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2456.274,2459.367,"Discovered by the prisoner himself, if he has no lawyer."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2459.367,2467.425,--There are several underlying assumptions here that need to be addressed.
1993.93-6497,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2501.505,2508.424,May I ask you this question: aren't you making an argument for unreasonable delay as opposed to an argument about jurisdiction?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2528.292,2547.082,"You're correct, it doesn't, and the equitable concerns seem to have come in in this case, although they should not come in, in terms of analyzing whether jurisdiction should be found in this case, and in fact this case is strictly controlled by 2251."
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.082,2551.267,I don't want to... am I interrupting your answer?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2551.267,2551.767,No.
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.767,2556.796,There's one question that runs through my mind in these cases when we talk about the delay.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2585.3,2590.72,That period of delay is not at all unusual.
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.72,2591.876,In Texas.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2591.876,2593.875,It can vary anywhere from 2 years to 8 years.
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2593.875,2597.515,But then why is there such a sudden emergency after 4 or 5 years?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2605.385,2610.025,"Well, it was not just a matter of 2 or 3 weeks to get a lawyer."
1993.93-6497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.32,2636.014,"Well, I must say that that's... it's hard to expect Federal judges or any judges to get excited about staying a Texas execution when Texas itself diddles around for 3 or 4 years before trying the individual and I think you should bear that in mind."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2638.779,2655.179,"Texas is well aware of that fact, and in fact in the 1993 legislative session tried to amend our habeas procedure to provide for the regular and routine appointment, to provide for filing deadlines that would not necessity setting execution dates to compel State litigation to go--"
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2655.179,2658.241,Wasn't the real delay here much before that?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2677.31,2695.569,"--In this particular case, I can't speak to specifics, but I do know that it frequently takes a year to get the record on appeal compiled, that the direct appeal may raise 20, 25 claims, so that the briefing on each side goes way outside the normal statutorily prescribed limits for filing the briefs on each side."
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2697.101,2714.765,"It just seems extraordinary that you are complaining about the few months that lapsed here and said that that was no occasion for a stay, and yet in the State's own process it took over 3 years to get from the conviction to the affirmance on appeal."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2714.765,2721.434,--It has been my experience in watching a number of capital cases go through that.
1993.93-6497,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2773.444,2777.255,"You mean, it was defeated... it was pending in the legislature?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2777.255,2780.191,"It got through the Texas House, and did not get passed in the Texas Senate."
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2781.831,2795.046,It may be that the defeat had nothing to do with giving the defendant adequate opportunity to get counsel.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2799.371,2801.871,There could have been.
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.053,2820.456,Do you know what the... what do the capital defendants' lawyers get paid in Texas for representing defendants in the State system?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2820.456,2822.222,At trial?
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2822.222,2822.518,Yes.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2822.518,2826.11,I'm afraid I do not know the answer to that question.
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.11,2826.532,"They are paid by the State, though."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2826.532,2827.016,"Yes, they are."
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.016,2831.89,They are.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2831.89,2837.745,"As the Court recognized, the issue before the Court is properly one of jurisdiction, not of the equitable concerns here."
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2860.081,2878.418,"Let me ask another question about your... assuming we don't have any deadline or time problems, and a petitioner just wants to get a lawyer and he files a perfunctory petition that is dismissed as really saying nothing, and then later he gets a letter and he comes in for the second time, would it be your position that that second petition was an abuse of the writ?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2878.418,2879.324,Yes.
1993.93-6497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2879.324,2880.027,It would.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2880.027,2901.253,The understanding that a habeas application is commenced by the filing of an application or petition raising constitutional bases for relief is consistent with the Court's conclusion in Barefoot v. Estelle that a stay can only be entered if there is a substantial showing of the denial of a Federal right upon which relief might be granted.
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2953.763,2967.133,"May I just understand that your essential position is that what must be done, and what cannot be avoided, is in the first instance the petitioner himself file an adequate petition, uncounseled?"
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2967.133,2968.618,--That is correct.
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2968.618,2969.711,That's what has to happen.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,2986.484,2993.873,The critical point of my argument is that he's not entitled to a stay while he finds counsel.
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2997.199,3007.867,"Yes, but that... but the constitutional basis would be coming in with an adequate complaint, and he can't get counsel for that, and he's not entitled to counsel, you say, until he has that well-pleaded complaint on his own."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3014.676,3020.424,I disagree only that I believe that he can file an adequate complaint without the assistance of counsel.
1993.93-6497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.424,3023.017,"Well, and you don't insist that he come in on his own."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3056.815,3066.312,"If I understand your question correctly, yes, and in fact in this case Tarrant County District Attorney's Office said, file a petition of any sort."
1993.93-6497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.633,3091.458,"So Congress can be relying on State-provided free legal services to get the foot in the door, and once the foot is in the door, the Federal funding will take over."
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3096.893,3099.47,The State habeas actions?
1993.93-6497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.47,3099.673,Yes.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3099.673,3102.532,In some... they have the authority to.
1993.93-6497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3104.968,3105.889,And they didn't in this case.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3105.889,3106.279,No.
1993.93-6497,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3106.279,3113.558,I take it there's no State agency or defense agency that maintains a list of lawyers who are willing to file well-pleaded complaints for free.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3113.558,3119.118,There is no... there is no State agency that maintains that list.
1993.93-6497,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3128.052,3132.816,Are there enough of them to represent all of these people to get their well-pleaded complaints in?
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3132.816,3136.878,I do not know the size of their staff.
1993.93-6497,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3136.878,3138.189,You don't know how many there are.
1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3138.189,3139.611,No.

1993.93-6497,1,35863,margaret_p_griffey,,3146.919,3148.434,That is correct.
1993.93-6497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3149.309,3149.965,--did it on his own.
