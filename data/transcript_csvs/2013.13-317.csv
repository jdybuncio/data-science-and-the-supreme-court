2013.13-317,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.504,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 13-317, Halliburton Company v. The Erica P. John Fund."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,8.804,12.339,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-317,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.653,84.035,"I believe that in Basic, Justice Blackmun said that there is this economic theory, but also the motivation for the Exchange Act and probability and common sense would lead to this presumption -- this rebuttable presumption."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,92.541,111.102,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the court in Basic recognized that Section 18(a) was the proper analog, but then it immediately turned to its own notions of public policy and the best way to further congressional policy, instead of asking what sort of reliance does Section 18(a) require."
2013.13-317,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.102,117.773,"Where is that, that it says that 18(a) is the proper--"
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,117.773,119.125,I believe--
2013.13-317,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.125,119.625,--reference?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,119.625,122.31,"--I believe it's on page 245 where the court says,"
2013.13-317,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,142.824,153.531,"Mr. Streett, that argument, of course, is just an argument that Basic was wrong in -- in -- in not focusing on -- on Section 18, and that's contestable."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,188.871,193.006,We're saying both that it was wrong when decided and that certain things have changed.
2013.13-317,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,241.754,242.272,What is your third?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,242.272,243.256,--Pardon?
2013.13-317,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,243.256,244.006,You said three.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,244.506,245.124,Yes.
2013.13-317,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,279.462,285.533,So -- so you are not relying anymore on the notion that the efficient markets hypothesis has been undermined.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,308.881,313.602,"Cited at that general -- general level, we don't disagree with it."
2013.13-317,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,328.545,330.378,"Well, but we don't have that kind of binary approach."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,358.814,387.584,"It's -- it's binary in the sense that the principal driver of class certification is whether the market is efficient in a yes-or-no binary sense, and that's why we have raised our second position, which is if the Court were inclined to keep the presumption in some sense, it should at least place the burden on the plaintiff to establish that the misrepresentation actually distorted the market price, or to give defendants the full right of rebuttal at the class certification stage to establish the price was not impacted."
2013.13-317,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,387.584,391.385,Do we know how often defendants have been successful in rebutting the presumption?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,391.385,394.17,It is -- it is virtually impossible.
2013.13-317,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,425.207,425.773,Could I ask you--
2013.13-317,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,425.773,429.825,Isn't the -- isn't the -- it's not a question of is it rebuttable.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,457.725,471.818,"And we are not aware of a single instance in which this Court allowed a presumption to be invoked for the very purpose of one stage of litigation, but held that the defendant's right to rebut must be delayed to a later stage."
2013.13-317,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,481.943,494.017,"--I -- I understand your friend on the other side to acknowledge that the efficient market theory is not perfect, that there are situations in which events are not reflected in the market price."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,524.287,526.388,We don't think the Court needs to do that.
2013.13-317,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,534.142,548.318,"No, your submission is that we should jettison the Basic test because economists now believe that the efficient market theory is not sufficient -- sufficiently accurate or true to support it."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,553.289,562.328,"--Of course, our principal submission is that no economic theory should supplant what Congress enacted in Section 18(a) in the most analogous cause of action."
2013.13-317,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,594.366,602.803,"In a class action, how do you prove loss causation without proving price impact?"
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,622.3,626.92,--A class under fraud in the market theory could not do that.
2013.13-317,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,635.443,636.876,"Well, that makes no sense."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,636.876,637.993,"--Well, let me--"
2013.13-317,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,637.993,648.767,"Because if they relied on their statement, then that's -- they have to prove loss causation in the same way that the class does."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,659.474,668.414,--A plaintiff within the class could still establish loss causation without price impact in the same way that a plaintiff in the class could establish loss.
2013.13-317,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,668.414,668.73,How?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,668.73,669.497,By--
2013.13-317,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,669.497,672.716,With the same misstatement at issue?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,672.716,678.72,--By purchasing in reliance on that misstatement at a price that was not on the New York Stock Exchange.
2013.13-317,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,678.72,682.924,Then how is such a plaintiff's claim typical of the class?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,723.582,737.841,"I'm relying on a case where the misrepresentation was made in a way that's typical to the class, but individual class members purchased off of the exchange and therefore they purchased at a different price, perhaps, than what was on the exchange."
2013.13-317,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.649,760.69,"Can you -- can -- to take a totally different case, just thinking of the announcement of the opinion I had, is a contract case."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,828.584,836.088,Because market efficiency and publicity are also common issues that this Court required to be considered at the class certification stage.
2013.13-317,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,841.409,843.078,"Now, we've required them to be considered because--"
2013.13-317,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.078,854.469,"It's certainly not the rule -- it's certainly not the rule that every -- every issue that is common has -- has to be decided at the preliminary -- or I'm sorry, must be left to the merits."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,864.857,866.109,That's absolutely correct.
2013.13-317,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,874.799,880.869,"--Mr. Streett, there's a -- there's a real difference with respect to those issues and I think that this was really what Amgen said."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,922.027,927.598,"Well, that same argument could have been made against market efficiency or publicity."
2013.13-317,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,931.968,947.327,"I think that the -- that the difference is that even if you don't have market efficiency and so you lose the ability to bring the -- a claim with the fraud on the market presumption, you might still have an individual reliance claim."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,947.327,947.927,Yes.
2013.13-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,988.835,989.337,Finish your sentence.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,989.904,994.906,--Cannot be what this Court intended in Basic when it created a rebuttable presumption.
2013.13-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,994.906,1006.114,"--Would you address briefly the position taken by the law professors, I call it the midway position, that says there should be an event study."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1034.883,1035.783,Yes.
2013.13-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1070.973,1076.977,Am -- am I correct -- and this would be more of a question for your friend representing the Respondent.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1092.136,1092.569,Yes.
2013.13-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1093.921,1098.99,"And so then the question would be since you're going to have it anyway, why not have it at the class certification stage."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1098.99,1099.323,Yes.
2013.13-317,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1110.698,1113.064,I don't see how this is a midpoint.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1137.931,1139.715,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-317,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1139.715,1144.252,So why bother with Basic at all if we're going to do what you're suggesting--
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1144.252,1145.219,We agree--
2013.13-317,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1145.219,1152.525,--turn the -- turn the class certification into a full-blown merits hearing on whether loss causation has been proven?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1152.525,1153.958,--It is not loss causation.
2013.13-317,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1183.16,1203.558,"Can you tell me, based on your experience, compare the -- the cost, the extent of time, the difficulty of showing under Basic the efficient -- that there is an efficient market, and compare and contrast that with undertaking an event study."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1206.593,1207.993,"No, Your Honor."
2013.13-317,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1237.295,1241.266,"Well, how hard is it to show that the New York Stock Exchange is an efficient market?"
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1241.266,1245.218,"--Well, the courts look at several factors."
2013.13-317,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1250.789,1258.794,So I would think the event study they are talking about would be a lot more difficult and laborious to demonstrate than market efficiency in a typical case.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1258.794,1272.552,"--Well, just to take this case for an example, the plaintiff's expert used an event study of all of the unexpected corporate news throughout the entire class period to prove market efficiency because courts have said that's one important factor to show market efficiency."
2013.13-317,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1279.891,1297.352,"What happens if the -- if the plaintiffs say, Your Honor, I have 5,000 people here, all of whom bought the stock on the New York Stock Exchange between March 15 and April 15, and as far as people who had other kinds of reliance, we'll bring a separate case about them later."
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1327.289,1328.422,Yes--
2013.13-317,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.422,1329.907,Why go into the event study?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1330.374,1337.996,"--Because even in a generically efficient market in a binary sense, misrepresentations may not distort the market price."
2013.13-317,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.746,1339.496,Of course that's true.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1367.096,1374.669,--For precisely the same reasons that common issues of market efficiency and publicity are essential at the class certification stage.
2013.13-317,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.669,1381.339,How many -- how many of these cases -- what percentage of these cases continue once there has been class certification?
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1382.806,1383.525,Very few.
2013.13-317,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.075,1385.475,Very few.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1388.16,1389.112,--Yes.
2013.13-317,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.464,1394.547,I see that and I understand that.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1411.608,1425.368,"Because if market efficiency and publicity were not considered at the class certification stage, then the plaintiff would just have to plead an efficient market and would immediately go, you know, to collect $200 and pass go and get right to class certification."
2013.13-317,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1445.698,1448.983,Can I ask you a question about these event studies to which you referred.
2013.13-317,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1464.66,1468.212,Event studies are very effective at making that sort of determination.
2013.13-317,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1526.05,1526.767,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1531.452,1534.989,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-317,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1597.078,1603.232,"What do you make of Section -- what do you make of Section 203 of the PSLRA, which says that"
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1611.837,1622.212,"Well, Your Honor, what this Court said in Amgen afterwards is that what the -- what Congress did was it did ratify the private cause of action."
2013.13-317,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.866,1631.051,Did we refer to Section 203--
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1631.051,1631.751,You did not.
2013.13-317,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.751,1633.503,--in connection with that dictum?
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1633.503,1635.786,"I do not -- I do not believe that you did, Your Honor."
2013.13-317,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.786,1639.49,"I think maybe we didn't know about it, as the parties here seemingly did not know about it."
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1641.523,1665.055,"But whether or not you conclude that that was ratified or not, Your Honor, I think what -- what you must conclude is that when Congress acted both with respect to the PSLRA and even more so with respect to SLUSA, it acted on the assumption that they were legislating on the backdrop of the fraud-on-the-market theory."
2013.13-317,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.292,1671.592,Of course.
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1701.361,1704.813,"I think, obviously, the Court will decide."
2013.13-317,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1725.659,1736.282,"Mr. Boies, I don't know that I fully understood your point in your brief as to why proving price impact was so difficult."
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1745.973,1747.14,Sure.
2013.13-317,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1747.14,1758.881,"And the question I asked your adversary: If we believe price impact is necessary, why keep Basic if we're going to put it in a class certification?"
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1758.881,1761.166,Let me answer in the context of this particular case.
2013.13-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1815.484,1824.506,But why couldn't that same showing be made under the law professors' theory of an event study at the certification stage?
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1824.506,1830.06,"You could, Your Honor, and with respect to December 7th, I think that would not be so difficult."
2013.13-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1850.723,1852.742,For each one of -- of--
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1852.742,1854.944,--For each -- for each day--
2013.13-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1854.944,1856.277,"--Oh, each day."
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1856.277,1861.265,--you've got to look at what the confounding factors are and you have to try to separate them.
2013.13-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.523,1963.245,"But even if Basic did not rely on economic theory, and there is a dispute on that -- I think the opinion is not quite clear on that one way or the other -- if later economic theories show that the market doesn't react in the way Basic assumed it automatically did, then certainly Congress would not wish to foreclose the Court from considering that new evidence if it was a strong, clear and convincing, et cetera."
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,1963.245,1967.548,"Well, first, Your Honor, I'd say three things about that."
2013.13-317,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1994.099,2012.677,"But, Mr. Boies, to say that false representation affects the market price is quit different from saying that it affects the market price almost immediately, and it's hard to see how the Basic theory can be sustained unless it does affect the market price almost immediately in what Basic described as an efficient market."
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,2026.42,2036.543,I think -- I think Your Honor is right that if there is lag time in a particular market somebody who has purchased immediately after the misrepresentation would not be entitled to recover.
2013.13-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2095.231,2104.937,But the Petitioners say that this has produced a whole new genre of investors that are quite different from the fellow that's sitting at home reading the Wall Street Journal.
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,2104.937,2105.856,But all of those--
2013.13-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.856,2108.808,And your theory doesn't seem to take that into account.
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,2108.808,2113.21,"--It does, Your Honor, because all of those people rely on the integrity of the market."
2013.13-317,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2175.7,2182.37,"Well, you're saying that the events -- that the law professors' event study theory is flawed, then?"
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,2182.37,2182.82,No.
2013.13-317,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2204.72,2206.386,I didn't understand what you just said.

2013.13-317,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.063,2402.38,Right.
2013.13-317,1,20629,david_boies,,2402.38,2407.967,You could have summary judgment at the class certification stage.

2013.13-317,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2994.16,3004.799,Could you explain how the requirement that Basic imposed of proving publicity at the certification stage is consistent with the Court's theory in Amgen?
2013.13-317,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3004.799,3030.267,"I think the -- the theory in Amgen is that in order to decide whether something has to be proved at the class certification stage, you ask first, is it susceptible of common proof; and second, if the class is certified and the -- the statement or the fact is ultimately disproved down the road, is the effect going to be that the class splinters or that all plaintiffs lose in common?"
2013.13-317,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3059.702,3066.54,Do you think that's a realistic -- that is something that's likely to happen in other than extremely rare cases?

2013.13-317,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3194.572,3202.744,"Well, let me take the first part first, because I think in part it illustrates an important aspect of this case that tends to get lost."

2013.13-317,3,56133,aaron_m_streett,,3593.529,3601.352,--It -- it would be most consistent with Rule 23 to place that burden on the plaintiff because it's the plaintiff's duty to show that common issues of reliance predominate.
