1986.85-1656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.887,"We will hear argument next in No. 85-1656, James A. Lynaugh, Interim Director, Texas Department of Corrections, versus Gregory Allen Petty."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,78.922,90.278,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a statutory habeas corpus case brought by a Texas prisoner serving a 50-year sentence for aggravated robbery."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.099,318.436,"General Palmer, what it really boils down to, isn't it, that you want to be able to argue effectively that there is an abuse of the writ because even it they had just not taken this disposition, he could still have filed a second habeas petition, but you would have claimed it would be an abuse of the writ if he had?"
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,318.436,319.701,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,319.701,327.197,But why can't you still argue on remand to the District Court that there is an abuse of the writ here because he should have raised these things the first time around?
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,327.197,329.431,We could argue that.
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.406,373.055,Then should we really construe what the Court of Appeals has done as in effect holding that given the particular history of this case we don't think it would be an abuse of the writ for him now to raise these issues so let's just have him raise them in this case instead of filing a new proceeding?
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,373.055,378.054,"No, Your Honor, the abuse issue was never raised by either party."
1986.85-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.936,452.336,Why couldn't you argue in the Court of Appeals that allowing this amendment would be an abuse of the writ?
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,464.567,467.941,"Well, the Court of Appeals recognized that there had been no exhaustion."
1986.85-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.201,477.248,How about abuse?
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,478.685,479.591,No.
1986.85-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.089,493.68,"I know, but they might, have remanded and said we have to consider abuse of the writ before the amendment."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,493.68,496.852,"They might have done that, Your Honor but that is not the case before the Court."
1986.85-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.852,499.256,"Well, you didn't ask them to."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,499.256,501.567,"No, that is true."
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.474,503.443,I don't understand.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,507.441,508.393,The fact that Petty--
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.393,509.378,--Not saying something?
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,513.345,527.622,"--The abuse doctrine goes to whether the petitioner was aware of the claim at the time he filed his federal application and failed to raise that claim, and then in the second federal petition raised the claim--"
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.622,528.966,He has to have raised the claim.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,534.667,536.011,--That is correct.
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.011,536.853,How could there have been an abuse of the writ?
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,547.303,548.316,"Your Honor, we are not here arguing--"
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.316,549.676,"I am trying to help you, General."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,549.676,553.643,--We are not arguing that this is or is not an abuse of the writ.
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.173,558.673,Is there any basis on which it could nave been an abuse of the writ?
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,558.673,574.152,"--Well, we cited the Court to Woodard v. Hutchins, in which the Court opined or stated that a claim like this, an insanity claim surely was known to the petitioner, and failure to bring it would obviously constitute an abuse of the writ."
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.262,618.933,"Abuse of the writ does not consist in withholding a claim, does it?"
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,630.757,631.757,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.757,633.053,Isn't that what abuse of the writ consists of?
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,638.365,641.724,He never made the claim when he filed his writ in the District Court.
1986.85-1656,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.724,647.128,And simply failing to make a claim when you file a writ is not conceivably abuse of a writ.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,647.128,649.112,I agree with that.
1986.85-1656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.806,678.834,"And then if he had raised... filed another petition making the claim which the Court of Appeals actually considered on this one, then you could have argued abuse of the writ."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,678.834,679.865,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,845.456,850.017,May I go back to the facts for just a second.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,865.262,865.794,that is correct.
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.794,871.012,And on appeal the counsel became aware of this alleged shortcoming of counsel.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,875.916,879.884,"Well, Your Honor, it was not appointed counsel for Petty on appeal who raised this."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.551,892.565,"Oh, I see, so that Petty himself raised the failure to investigate the insanity."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,894.05,895.236,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.236,895.845,I see.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,895.845,900.141,"Now, of course, the matter was also included in the brief filed by counsel in the Court of Appeals."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.141,908.403,So what your view is that they should have just affirmed and then let him take his chances on tiling a second habeas petition making these allegations.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,908.403,915.713,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and I am aware of no authority which allows for the disposition made by the Court of Appeals."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,919.868,930.052,"Well, I suppose, though, if he had just... if they just affirmed and he filed the second petition the District Court would have had to dismiss it because it hadn't been exhausted."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,931.957,939.486,"Well, if it had been affirmed he would have had to go back to state court and exhaust his remedies before he would be entitled to file a second petition."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.033,943.001,"But they are going to dismiss this one anyway, and he has to go back to state court."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,945.236,956.67,"Well, the big difference, the significant, difference is, given the way the Fifth Circuit handled the case, Petty is allowed to amend to raise this claim."
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.06,958.654,Right.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,958.654,961.466,Therefore the amended petition will be dismissed for failure to exhaust.
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.466,961.95,Right.
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,961.95,964.466,That dismissal will be without prejudice.
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.725,989.22,"Well, there would be no adjudication on the merits of the defective assistance of counsel based on the failure to investigate insanity then."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,989.22,991.439,--There would have been no adjudication on the merits of any of the claims.
1986.85-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.608,999.201,"Oh, I see."
1986.85-1656,0,19818,charles_a_palmer,,999.201,1008.494,"And once the exhaustion issue is raised after the remand, the dismissal for failure to exhaust will not be on the merits, it will be without prejudice."
1986.85-1656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1112.986,1114.829,"Thank you, Mr. Palmer."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1117.436,1135.601,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, from Petty's perspective what this case is really about is the ability of the Circuit Judges to administer their dockets with flexibility and common sense."
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.027,1211.383,Was it agreed... did the Fifth Circuit opine on the question of whether that claim had been exhausted?
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1211.383,1232.189,"The Fifth Circuit stated in its opinion that that claim probably had not been exhausted, and that is why instead of reversing for an evidentiary hearing it reversed for amendment so that the state could respond and pursue its exhaustion defense if it chose to."
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1232.189,1235.702,And you agree that the claim had not been exhausted?
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1245.369,1247.634,At this point I don't challenge that issue.
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1263.816,1270.703,--But what you are defending here is the Fifth Circuit's treatment of this amended claim on appeal.
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1270.703,1278.232,What we are defending is the Fifth Circuit's power to handle its docket in the way that it considered appropriate under the circumstances of the case.
1986.85-1656,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1278.232,1290.961,"Counsel, let's assume for the moment that you prevail up here and you go back and have a trial in the District Court and lose again."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1314.546,1320.528,I don't know that there is anything in the language of the opinion that addresses that issue directly.
1986.85-1656,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1320.528,1340.38,"But... well, take a look at F2 in your petition, amended petition for cert. It is a printed document."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1344.69,1346.174,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1346.174,1364.73,"I agree with you xxx say whether or not you can come back repetitively, but I think the rationale of its opinion makes it perfectly clear that the court thinks you can come back whenever a claim is presented at the Fifth Circuit level that had not been presented below."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1364.73,1382.631,"I think, though, it is the exercise... it is the particular circumstances of this claim that caused the Fifth Circuit to exercise its discretion in this case, and I do think that the Fifth Circuit is limited in the exercise of that flexibility and discretion."
1986.85-1656,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1382.631,1385.489,So you think it is a a matter of discretion for the Court of Appeals?
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1385.489,1386.706,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.706,1416.835,"Mr. Breihan, why isn't it the case that when a matter rises to significantly enough injustice that it would be a proper exercise of the Court of Appeals' discretion to allow the matter to be raised anew it would not also be significant enough to avoid the contention of abuse of the writ if the matter were raised in the normal fashion?"
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1449.369,1455.695,I am not certain that I understand Your Honor's question.
1986.85-1656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.695,1462.348,"You agree that the Court of Appeals can't do this sort of thing routinely, that it is--"
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1462.348,1463.082,I would agree.
1986.85-1656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.082,1466.644,--To allow the new issue to be raised there has to be some extraordinary circumstance.
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1466.644,1467.519,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.984,1517.296,I understand all that.
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1535.915,1538.679,"Well, I think that... I think that is true."
1986.85-1656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1538.679,1552.439,"--So that therefore we really don't have to permit this kind of a procedure, which you acknowledge has its dangers, in order to preserve the rights of defendants to be defended against patent injustice."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1552.439,1570.917,"My response, Your Honor, is that the actions of the Fifth Circuit under the extreme circumstances of this case was to expediate the... expediate justice, to send it back to the District Court for amendment so that the Court could get right to its business of considering this new claim."
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.281,1597.311,What was extreme?
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1608.526,1621.209,"--First of all, under the circumstances, the petition that Mr. Petty filed had alleged the fact of a lack of a pretrial investigation."
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.95,1647.823,"Well, is that something that almost never happens in other habeas cases?"
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1647.823,1651.259,"I suppose that happens often enough, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.259,1653.773,So that doesn't make this case extreme.
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1653.773,1665.987,What makes this case a special case to the Fifth Circuit is that Mr. Petty came forward with the issue of prejudice on appeal.
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.75,1681.811,But do you have reason to think that doesn't happen fairly often in habeas cases?
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1690.808,1711.096,It is a... this is... in the interest of handling pro se litigation I believe it is simply an act of discretion.
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.096,1713.721,But isn't a lot of habeas litigation pro se?
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1713.721,1714.579,Certainly.
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.579,1731.73,"So it seems to me none of the factors that you have mentioned just now tell us that this case is any different from hundreds of others that may be going through the Court of Appeals, so therefore if the Court of Appeals were to follow the Fifth Circuit's decision here this would become a common practice."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1731.73,1743.021,"It may become a common practice, but I do not think that that would mean that it would become a... it would be common for the Fifth Circuit to handle the case in this way."
1986.85-1656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.021,1757.203,"Wouldn't it be a logical common practice, especially for a capital defendant who has been condemned to death, to raise his defenses in exactly this way?"
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1773.823,1791.052,"Well, to me, Your Honor, the key issue is simply the fact that in this case the Fifth Circuit has sent it back... sent it back so that this can be the one and only petition that Mr. Petty files."
1986.85-1656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.052,1792.441,"Well, why will it be the one and only?"
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1792.441,1794.784,"Well, because it--"
1986.85-1656,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.784,1798.939,He can file a petition after this one even if the lower court denies this.
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1800.391,1810.294,"--He could file another one, but not on these claims, absent being challenged by the abuse of writ doctrine from the state."
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.294,1821.757,"The thing that troubles me a little bit about this case is that this... apparently this really isn't a new claim, the fact that the lawyer didn't investigate the insanity defense."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1832.003,1832.191,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1881.019,1893.156,"Am I correct that in this case the magistrate did not go into the facts other than those set forth in the habeas petition, and apparently he also knew that the lawyer had represented the same defendant in some other matters, I guess?"
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1893.156,1901.559,The magistrate addressed... the magistrate first concluded that Petty's pleading was insufficient.
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.559,1901.809,Right.
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1901.809,1908.198,Then reviewed the record to determine such things as the fact that his counsel had conducted a voir dire examination--
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.198,1909.073,Right.
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,1909.073,1913.68,"--cross examined witnesses, and conducted a closing argument."
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2018.28,2025.761,May I ask you one other question?
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2026.386,2026.964,--Yes.
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.964,2035.227,"--In the District Court when the magistrate reached his conclusions and wrote out his report, that, I take it, is sent to the prisoner so he had a copy of that."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2035.227,2036.007,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.007,2054.172,"So that at least it would have been... presumably in most cases if the pleading is a little... doesn't go into the facts enough he at least theoretically could have responded back at the District Court level and said you have overlooked these facts, the ones he calls to the attention of the Court of Appeals, and then it could have been processed in the District Court."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2055.639,2062.513,"As a pro se petitioner he is limited in his ability, of course, to understand whatever he has been told by the--"
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.513,2063.076,"Right, I understand."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2073.261,2074.386,--I suppose.
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.386,2084.396,"And said that you have these additional facts that support the ineffective assistance claim, and I don't think there would have been any... dismissal with prejudice would have foreclosed that at that time."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2090.331,2091.081,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2091.081,2100.297,"Mr. Breihan, do you think perhaps some change in the habeas form application in the District Courts might solve this problem?"
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2100.297,2112.168,"Well, I think there is some... that issue is presented to the extent that Mr. Petty is a pro se petitioner and has followed the form pleading when he stated his case in summary fashion."
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.901,2217.421,"Is it not also true that the magistrate's disposition is not the traditional ruling on the legal insufficiency of the pleading, because it is kind of a mixture of his having looked at the record and satisfying himself, which would be good practice for the magistrate, that there was... there appeared to be effective assistance, so his dismissal was kind of a mixture of insufficiency on the face and not a full hearing, but yet enough of a look at the facts to come to that conclusion."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2217.421,2234.429,"His dismissal was based on the record that was in front of him, but I repeat that the record in front of him doesn't include anything that reveals the extent of pretrial investigation other than by inference."
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.429,2237.584,"Of course it wouldn't show that, but he did have a transcript of the trial proceeding, I assume."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2237.584,2238.022,"Yes, he did."
1986.85-1656,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.022,2239.225,Because he talked about the voir dire.
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2239.225,2260.078,"And so to a certain extent issues that were raised, inferential inferences can be raised based on the fact that Mr. Petty... Mr. Petty's counsel was familiar with some facts, though that does not go to the advice given Mr. Petty during the course of the pretrial preparation."
1986.85-1656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.361,2375.124,"Well, what if the Court of Appeals has said no amendment, you didn't raise it, no amendment?"
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2375.124,2376.951,I would say--
1986.85-1656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.951,2379.279,Is that an abuse of discretion or error?
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2379.279,2381.621,"--No, I would not think that would be an abuse of discretion."
1986.85-1656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.621,2388.165,"So it could have said you have to file a new lawsuit or something, new petition."
1986.85-1656,1,29205,john_r_breihan,,2388.165,2391.212,It could have.
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2409.612,2414.158,"If the Court has no further questions, I have no further argument."
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.949,2436.198,"May I ask you this before you sit down, General?"
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2456.91,2459.875,Dismiss for failure to exhaust.
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.875,2464.156,Dismiss just that part of the claim but not the whole--
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2464.156,2468.124,"No, the entire petition would have had to be dismissed."
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.124,2470.997,--Because there was an unexhausted claim.
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2479.292,2488.069,"Right, and as is pointed out in the Fifth Circuit's opinion at F5 this new factual allegation is treated as a new claim."
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.069,2507.219,"I see, so that had he done this in the District Court he would then have... there would have been a dismissal for failure to exhaust and... and that is exactly what is going to happen under the Court of Appeals disposition but you object to that because you cannot now argue abuse of the writ, but could you have argued abuse of the writ if it happened in the District?"
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2507.219,2507.798,"No, we couldn't."
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.621,2523.135,It wasn't quite not plea a case because the magistrate did look at the record.
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2524.572,2525.104,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.182,2528.635,"Oh, pardon me."
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2529.025,2533.4,The state convicting court said you allege only annotations and general statements.
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.549,2550.704,"Well, but the magistrate didn't dismiss it without at least looking at the transcript."
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2550.704,2555.843,"No, Your Honor, he reviewed the entire transcript in light of what Petty had pled."
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.843,2556.702,Right.
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2556.702,2563.7,"It wasn't until the appellate level that Petty raised these matters, but he certainly had ample opportunity to do so."
1986.85-1656,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2563.7,2565.575,Thank you.
1986.85-1656,2,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2565.575,2566.263,Thank you.
1986.85-1656,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2566.263,2567.605,"Thank you, Mr. Palmer."
