1968.791,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.406,"Number 791, Ronald L. Crane versus Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway Company."
1968.791,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,35.85,41.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.791,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.059,391.168,I suppose that's the usual rule of Iowa law?
1968.791,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,391.168,393.465,"No sir, as a matter of fact that's the minority rule, most states --"
1968.791,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.465,395.119,Not -- of Iowa law.
1968.791,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,395.119,396.34,"Oh, I'm sorry I misunderstood you."
1968.791,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,396.34,397.08,Yes.
1968.791,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,397.08,398.961,"It is a rule under Iowa law, yes sir."
1968.791,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,398.961,401.82,Yes.
1968.791,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,401.82,416.985,"Now the jury decided for the railroad and denied all recovery to Crane, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed with two justices dissenting, although it recognized that recent opinions of this Court put the matter in some doubt."
1968.791,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,491.458,493.806,"Mr. Prettyman, -- Mr.-- may I interrupt just for a moment?"
1968.791,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,510.556,510.686,No sir we didn't.
1968.791,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,510.686,518.441,"-- should apply or that no matter how great the plaintiff's negligence, he's -- there was still absolute liability on the part of the defendant, it was the latter, wasn't it?"
1968.791,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,518.441,526.146,"Yes, diminution of damages under comparative negligence would come into play only in a case under FELA only and not --"
1968.791,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,526.146,526.327,"Not the Safety Appliance Act, yes."
1968.791,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,526.327,529.434,-- involving the violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.
1968.791,1,44416,william_m_dallas,,1513.215,1519.705,Mr. Justice.
1968.791,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2145.158,2150.393,"But they did -- didn't the trial court give the instruction with respect to burden of proof, (Voice Overlap)?"
1968.791,1,44416,william_m_dallas,,2150.393,2158.702,"That's right Your Honor, that's in accordance with the Iowa law and the Iowa Supreme Court said that was a correct statement of the Iowa law in contributory negligence."
1968.791,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2158.702,2176.601,And your position is that action brought under the Safety Appliance Act does not carry with it an overriding of the state statute -- of state rule as to contributory negligence?
1968.791,1,44416,william_m_dallas,,2176.601,2178.015,"That's right, that's right."
1968.791,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2212.107,2214.873,I think you mean action was brought under the Federal Employer's Liability Act?
1968.791,1,44416,william_m_dallas,,2214.873,2215.779,"That's right, excuse me."
1968.791,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2215.779,2216.55,You used the wrong statute.
1968.791,1,44416,william_m_dallas,,2216.55,2225.706,"That's right, I -- excuse me for correcting my misapplication of the word."
1968.791,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2286.289,2298.695,"We'll recess now, Mister."
1968.791,1,44416,william_m_dallas,,2307.242,2319.708,Before the luncheon I had mentioned these previous cases that had been decided by this Court in the construction which this Court had given to the Federal Safety Appliance Act.
1968.791,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.538,2368.752,(Inaudible) Federal Safety Appliance Act?
1968.791,1,44416,william_m_dallas,,2368.752,2377.233,"Federal Safety Appliance Act, excuse me Your Honor, I'm -- if it wasn't for you gentlemen keeping me in line here, I had to be making some serious"
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3370.52,3374.491,"Mr. Justice White, you put finger exactly on the point here."
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.097,3399.261,Just bringing it to federal court without --
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3399.261,3400.205,That is the point.
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.205,3400.897,-- (Inaudible)
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3400.897,3409.064,What Mr. Dallas is really arguing about is whether there is a federal cause of action and I think myself that that is questionable.
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.53,3412.454,There's a cause of action under federal law.
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3412.454,3428.388,There is clearly a cause of action under federal law which can be brought in the state courts and even Schlemmer said that it is a federal question whether a particular defense could be asserted when -- under the Federal Safety Appliance Act.
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3428.388,3430.136,(Inaudible)
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3430.136,3431.407,Exactly.
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.888,3457.728,"Well, it has said -- it has said before (Inaudible) --"
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3457.728,3458.875,I'm sorry sir?
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.875,3463.009,It really has said before what -- it already answered that question before.
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3463.009,3464.939,"It has, that's my feeling."
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3466.619,3469.395,"Yes, so it's answered against you."
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3469.395,3471.309,"No sir, no sir."
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.481,3473.67,You don't think we have to overrule any cases?
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3473.67,3476.906,"Well, unless with a possible exception of Schlemmer."
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.296,3499.136,"The court has already construed the Safety Appliance Act as not, as not preventing or as not eliminating contributory negligence as a defense."
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3499.136,3500.029,I don't --
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.029,3501.553,It has already done that.
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3501.553,3504.349,"In Schlemmer, if you interpret it that way, it did."
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3510.407,3517.452,Has there been any attempts to amend the Safety Appliance Act if you eliminate contributory negligence?
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3517.452,3522.9,No and I think the reason is and this is the point I wanted to make was that I think this doctrine is dead anyway.
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3544.992,3554.544,"Yes, but you haven't got any cases where contributory negligence was offered as a defense and the defense has been stricken in the name of the Safety Appliance Act?"
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3554.544,3557.699,I can give you a case Your Honor where assumption of risk --
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.699,3565.564,"I'm not -- didn't -- I hadn't asked about that, because it's assumption of risk, it was eliminated by the Safety Appliance Act."
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3565.564,3568.969,Yes but only -- it would seem as to railroad employees.
1968.791,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.969,3576.072,"Well anyway, you haven't any cases on contributory negligence where the defense was stricken in the name of Safety Appliance Act?"
1968.791,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3576.072,3579.631,"Yes, my -- it's my position that it was in Shields."
