2014.14-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.6,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-15, Armstrong v. The Exceptional Child Center."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,11.685,16.445,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.14-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.43,83.85,"Could you tell me, if this is unlike those other cases where we've invoked the Supremacy Clause, what's the basis for those cases?"
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,83.85,101.34,"--The -- the basis for those cases is that there, there would have been a Federal law that allowed plaintiff's conduct, and then State law that interfered with that conduct that it was allowed by Federal law, and thus, the Supremacy Clause resolved the -- the conflict and provided--"
2014.14-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,101.34,103.595,I'm not sure I understand your answer.
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,103.595,103.92,--Okay.
2014.14-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,103.92,114.87,"That's the claim here, that there's a Federal law that is contrary to the State law, and I don't know why you can't look at this as an enforcement action."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,146.13,148.525,"I have two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.14-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,193.64,198.47,"Well, they could, and then you would come in and say, you violated Federal and State regulation."
2014.14-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.97,200.27,You wouldn't pay it.
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,200.27,202.19,"That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,208.97,215.43,"Yes, but what if they just asked the -- the patient herself to -- to pay a supplemental rate?"
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,219.865,224.79,"And that would be balance billing, which is also not allowed under State or Federal law."
2014.14-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,224.79,225.82,"Yes, it's not allowed."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,230.445,247.68,"And their defense would not be -- they wouldn't have a valid defense that our rates are too low in violation of the Medicaid Act, because they don't have a right to a specific rate or a process or anything else under Section (30)(A), and so they couldn't raise if we -- if, under that situation, we were to go after them for violating the rule."
2014.14-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,247.68,249.115,That would be a merits question.
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,258.335,261.79,And -- and that -- that might go to the -- to the merits there.
2014.14-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.86,286.235,We have an appendix to the red brief that cites some 57 cases.
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,300.765,301.89,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,338.265,339.76,Could -- can you do this?
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,404.52,405.38,They can't do that.
2014.14-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,405.38,405.715,Why not?
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,405.715,408.715,Because they don't have a right under Section 30(A).
2014.14-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,408.715,411.55,"No, I'm not saying we don't to write under 30(A)."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,471.98,475.385,"Well, let -- let me try to respond to your question, Justice Breyer."
2014.14-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,484.64,484.82,"Yes, yes."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,484.82,486.04,--under this Federal statute.
2014.14-15,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,486.04,486.25,Yes.
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,486.25,491.94,And that looks to me an awful lot like the claims that you -- that the Court entertained in Gonzaga and those kinds of things.
2014.14-15,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,547.3,561.015,"Well, did it go, Mr. Withroe -- and this is true of some significant parts of your brief, you might have an argument on the merits that there shouldn't be preemption here, that the nature of 30(A) is that the Federal law doesn't preempt the State law."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,572.97,573.31,Sure.
2014.14-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,599.35,599.625,--I'm sorry.
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,611.5,612.93,Not necessarily.
2014.14-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,664.18,677.43,"But why doesn't that -- I mean, I thought that the rate that the providers can bill is the rate that CMS approves."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,691.095,695.665,--Let me correct one aspect of the reference to the 2006 rates.
2014.14-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.22,730.405,And there has been -- has been no approval of the 2009 rate then?
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,730.405,732.325,Of the 2000 which rate?
2014.14-15,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.325,749.23,"The -- the recommended rate for 2009, the -- the rate that Idaho itself said was the appropriate rate, that CMS -- CMS did not pass on that."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,749.23,751.0,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,752.07,753.2,"I'm -- I'm sorry, what's correct?"
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,757.425,759.67,--That there's been no approval of the particular rates.
2014.14-15,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,783.24,788.99,"Well, I still don't understand why, as Justice Kagan pointed, that isn't just an argument on merit."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,849.189,864.24,"If the Federal government is wrong, then the time to raise that challenge would be in an APA action to challenge the approval of the State plan as arbitrary and capricious or in violation of law."
2014.14-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,864.24,866.355,Do they have that right?
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,866.355,873.695,"Providers, yes, as long as they meet the -- the zone of interest test, which I understand is a very low barrier, and they might -- they may as well do that."
2014.14-15,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,889.525,894.58,That's a somewhat ineffective remedy.
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,925.32,928.74,--They -- they have a number of opportunities available to them.
2014.14-15,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.58,968.715,I assume they could go to the Federal agency as well and -- and petition for a new rulemaking.
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,968.715,969.56,--Absolutely.
2014.14-15,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.56,979.87,"And if that rulemaking is denied, they could appeal on the basis that that final agency action is arbitrary or capricious in light of inflation."
2014.14-15,0,56139,carl_j_withroe,,979.87,981.51,"And that's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,985.805,986.47,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,994.81,996.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1013.82,1016.11,"Mr. Kneedler, you can and I won't interrupt."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1023.66,1024.49,"Oh, yes, absolutely."
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1100.42,1103.3,--I don't understand why that is.
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1108.745,1111.61,For -- for the reason that I said.
2014.14-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1125.98,1128.33,We're not absent the Medicaid program.
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1158.51,1159.925,"--No, I think it's quite different."
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1191.63,1193.17,That still goes to the merits.
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1193.17,1195.21,"--No, it does -- it does not."
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1207.53,1213.19,But this is forgiving the essence of the Supremacy Clause question.
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1259.455,1263.72,--What -- what Congress has set up is a -- is a program that is essentially contractual.
2014.14-15,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1281.28,1288.45,What effect would private suits like this have on HHS's ability to do its job?
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1291.225,1307.215,"I think there's a substantial potential to interfere or at least complicate, where there is an individual right under the Act, like if an individual beneficiary has a right to get particular benefits under the statute, and courts have held there are 1983 rights."
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1311.48,1311.75,What do you do--
2014.14-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1311.75,1316.835,"Judging from the -- the names on the brief, I take it that HHS does not agree with that statement."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1316.835,1318.965,Those are -- those were former officials.
2014.14-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1319.73,1321.22,Judging from the names on your brief--
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1321.22,1321.68,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2014.14-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1321.68,1326.59,"--or the absence of names on your brief, I take it that HHS does not agree with that statement."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1326.59,1333.25,"Well, in -- in some ways I suppose private -- private suits could bring attention to -- to what is going on."
2014.14-15,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1343.08,1344.25,I mean--
2014.14-15,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1344.25,1352.715,--I suppose -- I suppose HHS may be interested in having these provider rates raised so that they get a bigger chunk of the Federal budget.
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1383.39,1383.78,--No.
2014.14-15,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.47,1428.64,"If CSM thinks that that standard in (30)(A) isn't satisfied that they're not paying enough to enlist sufficient providers to provide the service, could CMS -- we're told in the briefs they can cut off funds."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1442.055,1458.36,"It may be, although I think such a suit would -- would be best brought after the -- the secretary has gone through the administrative process, so that there -- so what would be enforced would be the secretary's judgment about whether the rates are sufficient, not asking a court to decide it in the first instance."
2014.14-15,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1458.36,1467.37,"So you -- you agree that -- that CMS has never blessed this 2009 rate, the rate."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1467.37,1471.52,"I mean, it -- it approved the procedures, but not the rate in particular."
2014.14-15,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1472.29,1475.28,"Just to follow up, it never approves the rate in particular, right?"
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1475.28,1475.805,--No.
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1480.87,1496.535,"--Let's assume that I were to accept the former HHS officials' position that these private causes of action are highly important, given the limited resources of the agency."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1501.7,1508.35,Primary jurisdiction kicks only in -- kicks in only when a court first has -- first has jurisdiction.
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1515.17,1519.54,"Well, I'm not sure what -- “ jurisdiction ”, what that means."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1519.54,1523.16,"--Well, you have to be in court in order for primary jurisdiction to be triggered."
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1523.53,1524.95,"Well, this is a Federal law."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1532.04,1533.065,"Right, but--"
2014.14-15,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1533.065,1536.52,But we keep going back to how is jurisdiction missing.
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1536.52,1539.3,--Because there is no right to get into court.
2014.14-15,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1566.58,1582.975,"I'm thinking -- I'm thinking about your -- your -- your distinction between preemption suits we've had in the past and this, which is based on the Spending Clause and there you said there's a -- there's a right to proceed or right to life or liberty or property."
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1595.89,1596.76,"No, but -- but the business--"
2014.14-15,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1596.76,1599.14,--So that would -- that would -- that would fit your--
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1599.14,1600.01,--Absolutely.
2014.14-15,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.35,1616.47,--Why isn't -- why isn't the business of -- of medical -- providing medical services involved here?
2014.14-15,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1616.47,1620.04,Because the State is not regulating the business of providing medical care.
2014.14-15,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1627.73,1631.92,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1636.34,1639.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.14-15,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.46,1692.9,I'm sorry.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1718.76,1720.325,"They didn't apply it, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1720.325,1728.025,"That's -- that's your whole claim, right, is that they didn't -- the State didn't apply the methodology that the State developed and that CMS approved."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1732.2,1732.29,Right.
2014.14-15,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1732.29,1738.655,"--thing that is inconsistent with your position -- and the Department, for that matter, is consistent with your decision."
2014.14-15,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1750.22,1750.685,Approved.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1788.415,1794.18,"Because, Your Honor, there is no set of rules that would have allowed my clients to raise precisely that issue."
2014.14-15,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.3,1817.08,"There's no set of rules that allows the doctor to say -- in other words, it's not the State that pays the doctor?"
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1817.995,1827.89,"The State pays the doctor; but there is no set of rules that provides a method for a doctor to say, you've paid me the -- you've paid me the rate that the regulations require, but that rate was too low."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1829.325,1835.11,"If there were a set of rules to that effect, would you still have an action under the Supremacy Clause, or not?"
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1835.11,1841.05,--The equitable action we pursued here requires as an element that there be no remedy at law.
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1843.98,1854.825,"So -- but what you're saying is if the -- you cannot rely on the Supremacy Clause to enforce the action in that case because there are particular rules that give you an avenue of relief, right?"
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1854.825,1855.89,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.89,1856.23,Okay.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1868.14,1888.65,"In this particular respect, we are similar to those private cause of action cases in that where there's a method to review, neither -- equity no longer applies the right of action, and it answers the question that the Chief Justice raised in Douglas, which is: How can we conclude that something preempts if Congress says it doesn't?"
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1888.65,1889.48,It's a good question.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1889.48,1890.725,In that case where--
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.06,1910.27,When Congress has been silent.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1922.225,1928.55,"--In that case, we would have to evaluate that language to see what -- what it actually accomplished in context."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1944.38,1948.05,What if it -- what if it means that Congress doesn't want to review a private right of action?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,1974.62,1981.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, Congress has done that in many circumstances where it creates an express administrative process."
2014.14-15,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1994.05,2017.454,"And if you say that Congress can cut off -- that it can prevent a suit like yours, if it says that expressly, I don't know why it doesn't follow that Congress can also do that if it is clearly -- if we can clearly infer from the statute that Congress didn't want that, where do you get -- where does this express statement rule come from?"
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2017.454,2033.05,"Express statement may be overstating it, Your Honor; but the Court has decided in other cases that where Congress wishes to, you know, buck the existing law, so to speak, where it wishes there not to be a 1983 cause of action, for instance, you've required them to speak clearly."
2014.14-15,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2045.38,2046.83,How about 1983?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2050.51,2052.245,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.485,2065.37,"When you say it's clear -- it's clear to exclude a 1983 claim, but it's not clear to exclude the claim that you're bringing--"
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2065.37,2066.39,The decision--
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.39,2067.08,--why is that?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2067.08,2071.98,"--The decision, Your Honor, in Gonzaga v. Doe would require clearer rights-creating language."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2076.47,2079.51,Isn't there a difference in the remedies of the two actions?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2079.51,2080.65,"Absolutely, there is."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2080.65,2089.87,"I mean, you know, when we're talking about a private right of action, we're talking about damages, we're talking about restitution, we're talking about all sorts of things."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2095.555,2097.46,"That -- that is it, Justice."
2014.14-15,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.98,2110.02,Let me try once more.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2197.475,2210.82,"Your Honor, I believe that you're correct, that at that point the district court could, and perhaps should, say, wait a minute, you're saying 80, the agency's saying 60, let's ask CMS."
2014.14-15,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.76,2251.825,"There used to be a fairly well established doctrine at the Civil Aeronautics Board, of blessed memory, and the -- the -- they'd sometimes get briefs, sometimes they'd send the parties over."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2261.61,2261.94,All right.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2276.43,2277.115,--No--
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2277.115,2279.95,--What exactly are you saying?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2285.795,2295.195,"--The State went to the Federal Government and it said: Looking forward, when we spend Federal dollars we will do it by applying this method."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2295.195,2296.105,Right.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2296.105,2300.055,"And CMS said: Great, we like that method and it's approved."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2330.91,2331.29,So you're saying--
2014.14-15,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2331.29,2335.92,Can I ask you this question to understand how far your argument goes?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2372.879,2379.605,"In -- in that case, Your Honor, I think their injury is not caused by the State law."
2014.14-15,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2389.93,2391.72,But you're saying there wouldn't be Article III standing.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2398.76,2404.275,"--Assuming those elements are present, then, yes, there's a right of action to bring the preemption claim."
2014.14-15,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2432.19,2432.78,What about if--
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2432.78,2433.56,If you have--
2014.14-15,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2433.56,2442.265,--In this case -- in this case there is a puzzle based on the district court's determination.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2477.725,2484.035,--30(A) has long been understood to impose both procedural and substantive requirements.
2014.14-15,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2512.84,2525.515,"But if you look at this and say, well, the service was efficient, it was economical, quality care, and it enlisted enough providers."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2525.515,2533.55,"--Your Honor, we stipulated that it enlisted enough providers and we stipulated that the -- that the Respondents had been providing quality care."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2538.46,2545.275,--Could I -- but that's really irrelevant -- it's not relevant to -- to your argument.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2582.575,2584.83,"You are correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2588.95,2589.26,Absolutely.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2589.26,2594.245,"Because when the State has received approval but doesn't implement, there is no other remedy."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2594.245,2598.155,--What -- there are dozens of different types of providers under the Act.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2628.685,2636.77,"The agency, in this case CMS, is always entitled to deference and a fairly high degree of deference on issue such as this."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2649.52,2651.65,"That's in each -- in each particular case, right?"
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2670.375,2682.62,"Since at least 1969 this Court has allowed cases very similar to this, if not identical to this, but very similar to this, to be brought to the Court, and that was the date of Rosado v. Wyman."
2014.14-15,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.77,2702.09,"That's not the problem, the problem -- that's -- I mean, that underlying this is what's bothering me, that you have a very strong case, in your view, that there is a number, the number is produced by CMS methodology, they just didn't follow it."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2743.99,2751.21,"I think the problem is solved, Justice Breyer, by primary jurisdiction is one method, but also by existing notions of deference."
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.205,2754.25,Excuse me.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2757.27,2758.15,"--No, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.175,2760.02,Well--
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2760.02,2765.04,"The agency spoke and said this was the method to, to calculate these rates and the--"
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2765.04,2771.865,--But you don't want us to send it back to the Federal agency so they can tell us whether you're right or wrong about the number?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2771.865,2773.97,"--The agency has spoken on this issue, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.435,2776.92,They approved the methodology.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2794.78,2796.0,What--
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.0,2796.655,Which is it?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2796.655,2801.31,--The decision whether to seek the agency's input lies in the first instance with the district court.
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.31,2801.75,I see.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2803.42,2807.87,"I believe the -- if there was a need for that, the State should have asked for it."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2807.87,2808.47,Mr. Piotrowski--
2014.14-15,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2808.47,2812.39,"It seems to me if I understand your claim, it's that CMS has already spoken."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2818.335,2819.78,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2820.1,2821.67,So they're not going to send it back for you.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2826.9,2829.06,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.06,2831.235,HHS has not said $80.
2014.14-15,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2841.105,2841.51,"No, you think--"
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.51,2845.965,--under primary jurisdiction but you didn't ask for that and you still don't ask for it.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2845.965,2847.28,"Your Honor, we didn't choose the number."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2858.75,2859.83,--That's the problem.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2897.535,2899.41,"That is not what happened here, that's right."
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2899.41,2899.56,All right.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2899.56,2899.87,That's correct.
2014.14-15,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2899.87,2912.205,"So maybe there's something wrong with the injunction, but all you were seeking was compliance with Federal law, follow the methods and procedures that CMS approved."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2912.205,2913.77,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2916.3,2935.495,"Well, if that's correct, then it's -- again, as Justice Breyer pointed out, there's no way to allow you to seek that relief under an implied right of action under the Supremacy Clause without opening the courthouse door to everybody who says the Federal law was not followed, whether it was in going from 80 to 60 or improving the methodology or whatever."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2935.495,2938.22,"That is -- yes, Your Honor, that's right."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2943.51,2944.48,"Well, so it doesn't matter."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2953.02,2956.49,--The -- it depends on what each State does.
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.805,2984.185,"If I understand your position, it is that the Federal Government could create a system in which it's for the Federal agency to decide whether the State has complied or not."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2990.135,2991.78,"Yes and yes, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.78,2995.11,And you say it cannot do so impliedly.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,2995.11,3000.81,The -- whether it could do so impliedly is a -- truly a decision for a different case.
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.56,3030.605,I think they're -- they're asserting that under our standard there -- there is no private right of action unless it is created by the Congress and we do not have implied rights of action.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3048.345,3051.94,The implied right of action cases address a different problem.
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3071.75,3082.95,"That may well be, but it seems to me it's -- I am able to say that -- that when Congress wants the scheme that you desire, it creates a private cause of action."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3091.73,3098.1,"That outcome we believe is inconsistent with the history, the history of the drafting of the Supremacy Clause."
2014.14-15,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3110.61,3120.655,"If the plaintiffs in Sandoval and Gonzaga, for example, had brought a suit like yours, would they have stated a claim?"
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3120.655,3122.84,"Yes, they would have."
2014.14-15,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3122.84,3125.1,So they just missed -- they just missed the boat.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3131.185,3131.42,And--
2014.14-15,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3131.42,3144.62,So the Court spent a lot of time determining whether there's an action -- whether there's a claim under 1983 or whether there's an implied cause of action at all was clear and has been for a long time under the Supremacy Clause itself?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3144.62,3146.19,"--Nothing was missed at all, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3160.02,3160.63,--Could I--
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3160.63,3170.06,"In the 1983 claims, the remedies were much more wide open, and even in the implied right of action cases, we certainly have a damages remedy at the least and retrospective relief."
2014.14-15,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3170.06,3175.76,"--Mr. Piotrowski, could I go back to Justice Breyer's question and just if you will tell me if you agree with this."
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3202.465,3203.09,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3203.09,3206.13,So that leaves I think two kinds of cases.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3261.489,3272.69,"The vast majority of these cases will founder on the shoals of preemption, because there simply won't be a preemptive effect for the conduct that is challenged, whether it be a deference or some other tool."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3272.69,3274.745,Are those merits determinations?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3274.745,3277.485,"They are primarily merits determinations, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3312.63,3328.6,"Do you agree -- do you agree that -- with your brother that -- that C -- CMS could have gotten this injunctive -- could have gone into court and said, they told us this is their method, they didn't follow it, court enjoin them from not following the method?"
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3328.6,3331.5,"--Yes, I believe CMS could also bring such a case."
2014.14-15,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3332.74,3341.115,You're saying it's clearly right under the law because of CMS that we should get $80.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3366.475,3367.69,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3367.69,3369.68,Can CMS go into court as you say?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3377.82,3382.01,CMS certainly has the right to bring any right of action that my clients have the right to bring.
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3382.01,3382.48,Is that right?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3392.02,3394.615,CMS has not done what I suggest.
2014.14-15,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3396.17,3398.145,It's had that power but never used it.
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3398.145,3399.69,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2014.14-15,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3399.69,3410.96,Does CMS routinely -- and do Federal agencies that have this Draconian power -- do they in fact -- are there in fact fund cutoffs?
2014.14-15,2,56140,james_m_piotrowski,,3428.175,3433.585,"It is a nuclear option, Your Honor, and one that the agency has never used so far as we know."
2014.14-15,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3438.8,3440.05,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.14-15,3,56139,carl_j_withroe,,3444.94,3449.33,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.14-15,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3492.04,3503.765,"Sorry, Mr. Withroe, but I just -- when you say that, I mean, my understanding of the district court's opinion was that it was specifically -- it wasn't sort of doing this on its own in deciding what would be efficient by its lights."
2014.14-15,3,56139,carl_j_withroe,,3521.75,3528.585,--We did not ever say that these rates were necessary to bring us to compliance with Section (30)(A).
2014.14-15,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3543.08,3551.16,"So are you agreeing with him that you didn't follow the procedures and methods set out in (30)(A), that you went about it your own way?"
2014.14-15,3,56139,carl_j_withroe,,3551.16,3553.12,"--No, I don't agree with that."
2014.14-15,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3629.94,3635.95,"Let me -- let me go back to -- forget your position, take my hypothetical."
2014.14-15,3,56139,carl_j_withroe,,3646.94,3647.33,No--
2014.14-15,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3647.33,3657.48,"--and say, moving forward, follow the procedures and set a rate consistent with the methods and procedures that you obligated yourself to do."
2014.14-15,3,56139,carl_j_withroe,,3657.48,3660.25,"--No, they would not have a right of action, we would have the same result."
2014.14-15,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3683.42,3684.575,"Thank you, counsel."
