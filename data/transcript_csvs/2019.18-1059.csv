2019.18-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.4,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1059, Kelly versus United States. Mr. Roth."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,6.4,17.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Once again, the government is trying to use the open-ended federal fraud statutes to enforce honest government at the state and local levels."
2019.18-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,128.16,137.36,"You've said that if the resources were diverted to private use, then the prosecution would be okay."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,143.96,149.04,"Your Honor, I'm trying to distinguish the use of the property from the motive for the decision."
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,217.8,245.4,"So, Mr. Roth, on -- on that theory, would it or would it not make a difference if the defendants here, rather than doing everything that they did for a political reason, if they had done it to make their commutes easier or their families' commutes easier, so it wasn't anything about politics, it was their own personal interests, but they did exactly the same things, is that covered or is not -- is that not covered on your theory?"
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,245.4,248.48,"That, on -- on my theory, that is certainly not property fraud."
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,252.0,261.68,"So you're not making just a distinction between private uses and public uses? You know, private purposes and -- and public purposes, maybe?"
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,261.68,264.76,I'm certainly not making a distinction between the type of purpose.
2019.18-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,291.6,295.0,That's a hard -- can be a hard line to draw.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,307.76,308.88,"Your Honor, if it would --"
2019.18-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,308.88,322.0,"He has got a -- a -- you know, a development or something, he's building a hotel in -- in Fort Lee, and he wants the traffic redirected there or directed away from, whichever, because he thinks it will increase business at his hotel."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,322.0,327.64,"Your Honor, if the Court were to -- to consider that as a kickback, then that would be honest services fraud."
2019.18-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,357.92,361.64,What we're doing here is interpreting a statute.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,380.08,401.12,"So, Your Honor is correct, the relevant word is ""property"" and the second relevant word is ""obtain."" And this Court in Cleveland explained that when the government is making sovereign decisions in its capacity as sovereign, implicating its regulatory interests, that is not property within the meaning that Congress had when it enacted --"
2019.18-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,401.12,403.8,Was there a loss of money in -- in Cleveland?
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,403.8,407.32,"Well, there wasn't -- it's not clear if there was lost property."
2019.18-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,428.8,440.68,"But still, how does it fit in the statute? Is it that there isn't -- property isn't obtained when it is simply wasted? Is it that -- does it -- is it a gloss on the word ""defraud""?"
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,440.68,443.04,"I -- I think it's two steps, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,475.6,494.88,"So in the case of sending city snowplows to -- to -- to clear your own house first or sending city maintenance people to paint your own house, if you're a public official, I was under the impression that you thought that that would be a crime. Is that right?"
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,494.88,500.0,"If -- if the -- if you're sending the public employees to do private work, yes, absolutely."
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,509.92,510.68,So even though --
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,510.68,511.16,"-- that, though --"
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,511.16,523.12,"-- both are diversions of city resources or state resources, whatever it is, it's just one is regulatory and one is not because one involves personal benefit?"
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,523.12,523.84,Personal use.
2019.18-1059,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,544.36,550.36,"Is your theory that the word ""obtain"" is what does the work in response to Justice Kagan's hypothetical?"
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,550.36,552.44,"I think it's ""obtaining property"" together."
2019.18-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,607.52,623.88,"I can understand the distinction between a regulatory decision and the deprivation of property when the regulation -- when the regulatory decision doesn't cause a loss of property, but when the regulatory decision cause a loss of property, I -- I find it more difficult to see the distinction."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,623.88,624.52,"Well, Your Honor --"
2019.18-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,624.52,625.48,Explain it to me.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,625.48,640.68,"Your Honor, I think that every regulatory decision is going to have some consequences for public employee -- employee time, for example, which is the species of property that the government has invoked. But in this case -- let's take this case, just as an example."
2019.18-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,664.4,664.52,Right.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,678.48,704.2,"I think the Court would say the statute prohibits schemes to obtain property when you are using deceit to influence a regulatory decision, to change a regulatory decision, that is not obtaining property, and, in the corollary, that's important, is the costs of implementing a regulatory decision don't change the result."
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,704.2,709.16,"I think I'll try mine once more too, Mr. Roth."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,723.52,724.8,Because it's not the job --
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,724.8,724.96,I mean --
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,724.96,725.44,-- of government --
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,725.44,726.12,-- it benefits me --
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,726.12,727.2,"Right, but --"
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,727.2,734.92,"-- but, you know, I -- I get to send, whether it's painting or snowplows, you know, you -- you -- you go plow my street first."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,734.92,735.24,Right.
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,735.24,736.64,Why isn't that an allocation --
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,736.64,737.0,"So, so --"
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,737.0,737.88,-- of city resources?
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,737.88,741.96,Let me try to clarify because I think I may be -- I may have led to some confusion.
2019.18-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,798.64,803.36,"And that difference is, just to go back to Justice Alito's question, where in the statute?"
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,803.36,808.04,The difference is in the scheme to obtain property.
2019.18-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,827.92,836.24,"I'm sorry, I thought the scheme was to make life difficult for Fort Lee."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,857.04,866.12,"Your Honor, the difference is that here the alleged purpose, the alleged motive was what Your Honor said, right, to increase traffic --"
2019.18-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,866.12,867.4,That was the scheme.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,867.4,867.56,Yeah.
2019.18-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,887.6,915.08,"My -- my problem is, it's -- I don't think -- I can see a headline that would say it's okay for officials to use government public money in a way that is plainly unauthorized, not just in its motives but it's in end use, and an official can and should not be -- should never be liable for that."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,919.04,921.2,Your -- Your --
2019.18-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,921.2,923.16,-- for their private ends.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,923.16,923.48,-- Honor -- right.
2019.18-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,924.32,944.72,"Not mixed motive, which is the interesting question here with the traffic study and whether you have enough -- whether they have enough evidence that there wasn't a traffic study, but you're saying when it was -- and what the government has said, you're not authorized to do it, there's a question about that."
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,944.72,945.92,Yeah.
2019.18-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,945.92,949.24,And you didn't have even a mixed motive.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,952.24,963.68,"So, Your Honor, I'll let Mr. Levy speak a little bit more at length about unauthorized because actually the government's theory throughout the case was that he did have the authority and that he abused his power by making the decision."
2019.18-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,963.68,965.2,A much more difficult question.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,965.2,965.36,Yeah.
2019.18-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,965.36,965.72,Yes.
2019.18-1059,0,63217,jacob_m_roth,,965.72,969.72,But what I will say is I'm not trying to suggest that this is okay.
2019.18-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.16,1051.28,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Levy."
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1051.28,1066.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A public official who is acting politically and not for personal gain does not commit fraud by lying about his reason for an official decision if the decision was generally within his authority."
2019.18-1059,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1189.12,1196.8,The -- the arrangement is always that the -- there's a New York representative who's the executive director and the New Jersey representative who's the deputy; is that right?
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1196.8,1200.56,That was at the time the -- the arrangement.
2019.18-1059,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1225.08,1226.84,And this is -- this is a bi-state agency.
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1240.16,1251.36,"I don't know the answer to that except that the -- the structure within the Port Authority was that that was not the case. So they, in fact, as it actually played out, didn't agree to play second fiddle."
2019.18-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1274.8,1315.32,"I think one of the government's main arguments for -- on the sufficiency of the evidence, which is fairly pro-government, and in this situation, was that Mr. Wildstein had to lie to the Port Authority employees about the executive director knowing about this lane change. If, in fact, the reality of the situation was that Mr. Baroni couldn't do this without the executive director's acquiescence or acceptance, doesn't that show his lack of authority? Isn't that -- why isn't that sufficient evidence?"
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1315.32,1316.76,"So -- so two things, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1385.56,1389.2,Would you spend a moment on the traffic study?
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1389.2,1391.0,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1486.92,1488.2,Mr. Levy --
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1488.2,1488.6,-- what's true.
2019.18-1059,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1488.6,1506.36,"-- is it your position that -- suppose Mr. Baroni had said I'm giving you no reason at all or suppose Mr. Baroni had said we're going to do a traffic study, but it's going to be a sham traffic study. Would he still have had authority?"
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1506.36,1525.76,"Certainly, the first one. He certainly had at any point the discretion to say, as somebody had done very early on in creating these three traffic lanes -- they weren't required by anything -- at any point in time could -- could have said I think they should have a fourth or I think they should have only two or only one."
2019.18-1059,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1536.08,1539.04,"And the second, we're going to do a sham traffic study?"
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1539.04,1542.0,I -- I think he can -- he can do that.
2019.18-1059,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1557.16,1559.96,And you said that this was not a sufficiency question.
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1579.4,1583.88,"Frankly, the -- the -- the most obvious way to do is as a government forfeiture of the issue."
2019.18-1059,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1634.68,1635.04,Is there --
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1635.04,1635.48,-- authority.
2019.18-1059,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1635.48,1640.6,-- any -- any reason to think that the jury actually made a finding about Baroni's authority?
2019.18-1059,1,63218,michael_levy,,1640.6,1642.28,"No, there is no reason whatsoever."
2019.18-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1665.16,1671.8,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1671.8,1687.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The defendants in this case committed fraud by telling a lie to take control over the physical access lanes to the George Washington Bridge and the employee resources necessary to realign them."
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.12,1828.76,How -- how --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1828.76,1829.24,There can be --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1829.24,1832.16,"-- do you -- I mean, you have two separate points, I think."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1937.88,1954.84,"Well, Your Honor, let me answer the second part of your question first and then I'll try to get back to the first part. To answer the second part of your question, I don't -- as I was saying, I don't think there's a distinction between private and public uses works, because that's not a distinction that the statute draws."
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1955.44,1955.8,"Well, then --"
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1955.8,1956.24,-- you can draw --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.24,1956.84,-- we're back to --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1956.84,1957.88,-- with public entities --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.88,1958.36,My point was --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1958.36,1958.64,-- and --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.64,1960.36,-- why then -- we're back to honest services.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1960.36,1960.64,So --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.64,1962.76,There is no deprivation --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1962.76,1963.48,But that's --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.48,1996.0,"-- of honest services that does not require somebody in the government to spend some time or use some paper or use a telephone in order to achieve that dishonest thing, all right? If you're going to count that as property, well, fine, you could do it, I guess under some statute, but if you do it under this statute, this statute then prohibits the taking of dishonest services, exactly what the Court has held it doesn't do."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1996.0,2001.76,"So, Your Honor, if -- if I might answer that, it will take me a second to play this out, but I think it's a very important distinction."
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2055.0,2055.4,"Well, but -- but --"
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2055.4,2059.96,But not every fraudulent scheme and not every deceptive scheme works that way.
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2079.08,2086.72,But the basic difference between the taking the snowplow is that the official has no authority to take the snowplow for his private uses.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2095.24,2099.44,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, Baroni did not have that authority in this case, and --"
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2099.44,2099.84,"Well, that's --"
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2099.84,2100.28,-- and I can get to the evidence --
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2100.28,2100.48,-- disputed.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2100.48,2102.92,I can get to the -- I can get to the evidence of that in a second.
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.52,2116.56,Okay.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2124.64,2129.44,"Yes, Your Honor. That's -- they commandeered the lanes and the resources necessary to reallocate."
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2129.44,2131.28,They're still being used for public purposes.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2131.28,2136.52,"Your Honor, I'm not sure what they mean when they say they are being used for public purposes."
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2136.76,2140.56,"Because if other people want to use the highway to get to Fort Lee, they can."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2140.56,2140.88,So --
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2140.88,2142.28,They have nothing to do with the scheme at all.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2142.28,2146.44,"So, Your Honor, I -- I guess I would -- I would push back on this to this extent."
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2158.04,2159.6,They didn't decide any of those things.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2159.6,2159.76,Well --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.76,2162.12,They said anybody. It was just a problem getting there --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2162.12,2162.6,"Well, Your Honor --"
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.6,2164.44,"-- which was quite a problem, I grant you."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2170.6,2171.68,"Well, Your Honor --"
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.68,2176.64,"Hey, there's a law here, a rule, a rule, no, a rule: Treat every street alike."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2214.0,2219.6,"Your Honor, in that -- in that law -- in that hypothetical, there is -- we would not say that is fraud."
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2222.68,2224.12,"Oh, of course, there is."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2224.12,2225.24,-- no intent to fraud.
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.24,2232.96,"My -- my where are you going? I am going to Fifth Street first, and then I will go to the grocery store down the street --"
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2232.96,2233.04,Yeah.
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.04,2238.08,--- and then I -- Ah. And you know what he did? He went to the city councilman's street.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2255.8,2257.88,"We are not in honest services fraud, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2265.36,2265.64,They wouldn't have --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2265.64,2267.04,-- honest services fraud --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.04,2268.24,They wouldn't have given it to him if they --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2268.24,2280.0,"In -- in the honest services frauds -- fraud cases, in McNally, for example, there was no dispute that the defendants in McNally had the authority to decide who was going to insure the State of Kentucky."
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.0,2280.4,Well --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2280.4,2281.04,The problem was --
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2281.04,2284.56,"Mr. Feigin, that -- this is what troubles me about your -- your argument."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2291.32,2291.48,Yes --
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2291.48,2292.08,If he had the authority --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2292.08,2295.92,"-- if Baroni had the authority to do what he did, then he's not committing fraud."
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2295.92,2296.28,All right.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2296.48,2297.28,Even if he tells a lie.
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2297.28,2297.88,Okay.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2311.68,2313.12,The jury found he wasn't authorized --
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2313.12,2313.64,I'm sorry.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2314.0,2314.12,Yes.
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2314.12,2315.76,"-- he was not authorized, and there's sufficient --"
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2315.76,2316.28,That's correct.
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2316.28,2326.08,"-- evidence, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to support the finding. But I see no indication whatsoever, no reason to believe the jury made any such finding."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2341.16,2343.08,Let me say a couple things about that.
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2349.88,2350.28,"No, I --"
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2350.28,2350.76,-- question presented here.
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2350.76,2350.96,I know that.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2351.4,2351.64,Okay.
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2351.64,2361.8,-- I've never seen a criminal case where we're asked to defer to a jury's finding on something that the jury didn't find.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2365.88,2428.68,"So let me point you to a -- a couple of places, and then let me talk a little about the evidence of lack of authority. First of all, there's the instruction that the court of appeals deemed adequate, and that's at page 875 of the Joint Appendix, which is the instruction on obtaining property, which the court of appeals deemed sufficient to notify the jury that when someone is acting on behalf of an organization, acting as the agent of that organization, he's not obtaining property when he exercises the authority that the agency is duly conferred on him. But even better than that is the materiality instruction from pages 875 to 876, which says that if you find that the representation that the lane and toll booth reductions was for the purpose of a -- for the -- was for the purpose of a traffic study was false, you must determine whether that representation was one that a reasonable person might have considered important in making his or her decision to commit Port Authority resources for that endeavor, including services of Port Authority personnel."
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2428.68,2429.52,What -- what does that --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2429.52,2429.64,That --
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2429.64,2432.64,What does that say about authorize -- about authority to --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2432.64,2433.16,"Your Honor, if --"
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2433.16,2434.48,-- to reallocate the lanes?
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2434.48,2447.6,"If Baroni actually had the authority to reallocate the lanes for any reason or no reason, as his counsel just stated to this Court that he did, I don't see how the jury could have found that the lies that they told were material."
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2447.96,2456.48,"Mr. Feigin, everybody has authority to spend or do their act on behalf of the agency."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2470.88,2472.08,"Well, Your Honor, I don't --"
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2472.08,2475.76,Did he have authority to close the lanes on his own say?
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2475.76,2477.48,"He might have, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2478.64,2479.68,Did you prove --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2479.68,2480.52,-- was the authority --
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2480.52,2486.12,-- that -- did you prove that he had limited authority? Where did you prove that?
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2486.12,2504.16,"We proved that he did not have the authority to close the lanes under these circumstances without telling the lie. And I -- I can explain why if you would like. In -- when Wildstein proposed the idea of realigning the lanes, Baroni's immediate response was to ask Wildstein how he was going to do that."
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2540.4,2541.0,By the way --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2541.0,2541.52,Wildstein --
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2541.52,2557.48,"-- if -- if, contrary to the -- their expectations, there had been no slowing of traffic and, in fact, the lanes on one-lane traffic remained the same or maybe improved, would you still have a case here?"
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2557.48,2558.04,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2559.32,2559.64,And so --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2559.64,2575.64,"-- although the effect was catastrophic and that was a reason why the prosecution was brought, because of the incredible danger in which they put the citizens and commuters of Fort Lee, but they would still have committed the same crime. And they were hiding it from the executive director."
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2589.48,2590.96,Mr. Feigin --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2590.96,2608.48,"Now, Baroni clearly had significant authority within the Port Authority organization, but when someone questions how they're going to do something, has no idea how he's going to do something, and has to lie in order to accomplish it, has to lie that his boss has approved it, has to conceal it from his boss and has to avoid every legitimate --"
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2608.48,2608.96,But isn't it --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2608.96,2609.96,-- process verification.
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2609.96,2632.96,"-- isn't it often the case that somebody who has the authority to do something may lie about why the person is doing the thing because, if the real reason was exposed, there would be -- it would cause a furor, people would be angry, but that doesn't show the person doesn't have the authority to do it. A person hires his brother-in-law for a position."
2019.18-1059,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2643.08,2646.2,He doesn't want to say it.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2649.32,2672.16,"No, Your Honor, then -- but that's not the only piece of evidence we're relying on, and it's a different kind of lie. This isn't a lie about why they're doing it. This is a lie that Wildstein directly testified that they needed to tell in order to get the resources that they -- that they needed. It was clearly important to the George Washington Bridge manager and the manager of tunnels, bridges, and terminals."
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.64,2687.92,Why --
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2687.92,2688.72,Mr. Feigin --
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.72,2706.04,"What do you do about this, this is the same, but I don't want to lose what the question was in light of the instructions given. And what I have so far found is that the defense did ask the jury to be instructed to do just what you want."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2772.64,2773.04,"So, Your Honor --"
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2773.04,2774.48,So what do we do about that?
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2774.48,2778.08,"Well, Your Honor, I would look back at the materiality instruction I was discussing with Justice --"
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2778.08,2778.12,Yeah.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2778.12,2778.16,-- Alito.
2019.18-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2778.16,2780.96,But that isn't what the court of appeals relied on.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2780.96,2795.96,"Well, Your Honor, I think if the court of appeals got the substance of it right, and you don't agree with its particular reasoning, there is no reason to reverse, particularly when the question hasn't even been presented to this Court. This question -- this point was only really raised in the reply brief of Baroni who didn't even petition."
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2866.64,2867.16,But you say --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2867.16,2867.52,-- all of the defendants.
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.52,2870.52,-- the instruction -- you -- you thought the instruction was unnecessary.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2880.76,2887.76,"Well, Your Honor, I think that in retrospect it might have been better to instruct the jury somewhat more specifically on authority."
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2888.36,2888.72,Somewhat more --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2888.72,2889.16,-- their specific --
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2889.16,2892.36,-- specifically on the central point of your argument before us today.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2892.36,2918.8,"I don't know their specific instruction would have accomplished it. And I don't know the instructional issue is before the Court -- is before the Court today. But we are defending this -- these convictions on the precise same ground that they were found to be valid by both the court of appeals and the district court, which addressed the authority issue. The district court addressed the authority issue before trial telling the defendants they could argue it at trial."
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2943.08,2943.8,Mr. Feigin --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2943.8,2945.28,-- been convicted of fraud.
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.28,2954.6,"-- nobody, no decision-maker has the authority to make any decision for no reason."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2989.72,2990.52,"So my -- my apologies, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2990.52,2990.96,I -- I --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2990.96,2991.56,I simply --
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2991.56,3012.2,"-- I -- so -- so give me your definition of what ""authorized"" means, if he had the ability -- and when I first read your brief, it was if he had the ability to change the lanes on his own, then he had authority."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3012.2,3012.76,Yeah.
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3013.0,3013.24,All right.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3020.32,3021.76,"So, Your Honor, if he were --"
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3021.76,3026.88,How -- but it can't be no -- no authority.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3026.88,3027.16,"So, Your Honor --"
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3027.16,3028.2,Does he never have authority --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3028.2,3055.96,"-- I was -- I apologize, I was simply repeating the language that the court of appeals itself used which may have been a little hyperbolic, but if he were the person to whom the Port Authority entrusted the decision of whether there should be three lanes or one, such that his decision under these circumstances would govern, then he had the authority. I think the evidence showed that he was not that person."
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3057.0,3057.88,The fact that --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3057.88,3058.96,-- about his boss --
2019.18-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3058.96,3065.8,-- the -- the fact that the executive director could overturn him doesn't prove the positive.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3065.8,3075.0,"That's right, Your Honor. We wouldn't rely on that piece of evidence alone, just like, Justice Alito, we're not relying alone on the fact -- on the fact that he had -- that he told a lie."
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3112.68,3113.88,Mr. Feigin -- please finish.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3113.88,3116.72,"Sorry, I was just going to say, that's what Baroni did here."
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3117.48,3117.64,Can -- can --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3117.64,3118.0,-- Justice Kagan.
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3118.0,3130.08,"Can I switch, because the statute clearly says that a scheme of deception has to -- the object of it has to be to obtain property."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3161.24,3189.12,"Well, Your Honor, I think it was because this was -- this gets back to what I was saying to Justice Breyer earlier. This is a particular type of fraud, where -- it's commandeering fraud, where what they're trying to do is to take property that's in the victim's hands, here the Port Authority, and convert it to their own uses. It may be that if I take a knife off a table and stab -- that doesn't belong to me, and stab someone, my end goal is to stab someone but I've still stolen the knife."
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3189.12,3216.64,"But wasn't the commandeering here completely incidental, indeed unnecessary to the scheme being carried out? In other words, you know, there was a little bit of -- of -- of time for an extra toll person, actually to mitigate the -- the problems of the traffic jam or there were some people running around counting cars to conceal the purpose for what they were -- of what they were doing, but that was not the object of the scheme."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3216.64,3229.2,"No, Your Honor, the object of the scheme was for them to take control of real property, physical lanes, accessing the George Washington Bridge, and have those lanes be allocated the way they wanted."
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3229.2,3229.48,Okay.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3237.16,3237.84,That is one --
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3237.84,3249.36,"But it's not appropriating the George Washington Bridge, it's reallocating lanes on the George Washington Bridge and I would have thought that Cleveland makes clear that that's not an appropriation of property either."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3249.36,3279.64,"I -- I -- Your Honor, I think it's both because they needed the employee resources in order to accomplish what they were trying to do with the bridge. And if I could address Cleveland for a second, this case and Cleveland do both involve governmental decision-making but that's where the similarities end. In Cleveland, the object of the scheme was to obtain a license under a regulatory scheme that had no private analog whatsoever. The Court rejected every private analog the government offered for it."
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3313.8,3323.52,"But that's because the object of the scheme is to use the employee labor to get your house painted, but I -- I don't think that you can say the same thing here."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3323.52,3324.52,"Your Honor, the --"
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3324.52,3324.96,You were not --
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3324.96,3325.2,-- reason --
2019.18-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3325.2,3329.24,-- using the employee labor to create the traffic jam.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3329.24,3336.08,"They are using the employee labor as if it were theirs, not as if it were something that the Port Authority gets to use."
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3347.16,3347.72,"Well, but you picked --"
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3347.72,3348.6,-- the pilot's time as well.
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3348.6,3351.68,You -- you picked -- you picked an example that is easy for you.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3371.88,3372.12,So --
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3372.12,3377.64,Your theory would say that that's taking of property so it's covered by the fraud statutes.
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3377.64,3382.64,"We wouldn't, Your Honor, and I'm -- I'm actually glad to have a -- a chance to -- to make this perfectly clear."
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.6,3440.56,"Well, here the object -- the object of the scheme was not to commandeer lanes on the bridge."
2019.18-1059,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3455.0,3456.56,"I don't think that's right, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3482.84,3485.64,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Roth."
2019.18-1059,3,63217,jacob_m_roth,,3485.64,3486.8,Thank you.
2019.18-1059,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3548.96,3552.44,"Mr. Roth, you responded to one-half of their theory."
2019.18-1059,3,63217,jacob_m_roth,,3555.2,3555.56,Yes.
2019.18-1059,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3555.56,3557.48,And the other half is the employee time.
2019.18-1059,3,63217,jacob_m_roth,,3557.48,3557.84,Yes.
2019.18-1059,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3557.84,3559.76,So what's your response to that?
2019.18-1059,3,63217,jacob_m_roth,,3559.76,3567.12,"My response to that, it's actually what he said at the end, which is that the incidental costs of a decision are not the -- are not its object."
2019.18-1059,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3579.4,3583.88,"Why do you call it incidental? I mean, it was essential to the scheme."
2019.18-1059,3,63217,jacob_m_roth,,3583.88,3587.8,"Because it's incidental, Your Honor, in that it -- it was the implementation cost."
2019.18-1059,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3603.0,3607.32,What if it cost a million dollars? Would it be incidental?
2019.18-1059,3,63217,jacob_m_roth,,3607.32,3608.32,"No -- yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1059,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3613.84,3614.48,"Thank you, counsel."
