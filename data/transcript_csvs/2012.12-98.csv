2012.12-98,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-98, Delia v. E.M.A.--"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,6.754,10.272,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,34.137,34.971,How do you know that ex ante?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,34.971,35.923,--Excuse me?
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,35.923,37.823,How could you ever know that ex ante?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,58.42,68.06,"Justice Sotomayor, the answer to that depends on whether the State has to predict with certainty the amount--"
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.06,74.048,"Life is never certain, and so I don't even go to that issue."
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,97.914,101.782,"--Your Honor, the -- the statute doesn't predict; it defines."
2012.12-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.064,126.897,They must allocate?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,156.949,163.855,"--Your Honor, the State is saying that as to the amount of Medicaid benefits provided, the State has the right of recovery."
2012.12-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.557,168.607,Maybe you didn't hear my -- my question.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,175.277,178.713,--The State has the right to recover that portion.
2012.12-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.713,180.748,Let me ask my question again.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,187.919,198.209,"And -- yes, Your Honor, the position would be there is no property right in that -- in that percentage that the State has conditioned the extension of benefits on."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,198.209,213.902,"Now, how does it have the right to announce that in a FELA case or in a Jones Act case where those injured parties, they have a property right in their protection but this statute applies to that recovery as well?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,213.902,223.758,"If those -- if those litigants are Medicaid recipients, it applies to them as a condition of having received the State Medicaid benefits."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,223.758,228.829,So they can deny a litigant a property right in that recovery?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,228.829,231.43,As a--
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,231.43,233.632,I don't know how you can go in and ask for something you don't own.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,250.325,253.761,"--Your Honor, I'm -- I'm confused by the question."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,254.713,258.015,How do you sue for something you have no property interest in?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,258.015,263.569,"--I don't know how you'd sue for something you don't have a property interest in, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,263.569,266.604,So go back to Justice Scalia's question.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,266.604,269.473,The inner--
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,269.473,273.174,There has to be some interest in the 30 percent by the plaintiff.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,273.174,278.744,--The -- the 30 percent attaches upon the recovery from a third party.
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,297.29,298.742,Could I just clarify one point?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,307.681,309.331,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,309.331,311.965,Your brief is not clear on that.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,321.588,326.642,"Your Honor, the stipulation must include the State as a party to it for it to be binding."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,327.259,332.463,So what you're basically now saying is that there can never be a stipulation.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,332.463,336.681,"--There could be an advance agreement, Your Honor, but--"
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,336.681,341.235,You're saying that the parties cannot enter into a stipulation.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,341.235,350.175,"--If the parties are private litigants, a plaintiff and a defendant in a medical malpractice action, their -- their stipulation doesn't bind the State."
2012.12-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.292,354.911,"You can bind the parties for other purposes, I assume."
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,373.123,376.925,"--Your Honor, the statutory percentage applies in that situation as well."
2012.12-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.944,380.527,Okay.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,380.527,387.3,"Again, the State's interest is the amount of the Medicaid benefits it provided, capped at 33 percent of the recovery."
2012.12-98,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,387.3,389.1,"General, how do you come up with 33?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,395.069,400.29,The North Carolina General Assembly first enacted it as it relates to Medicaid in 1988.
2012.12-98,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,419.335,429.21,What if this case is tried to a verdict and there is a special verdict and the jury says that 10 percent was medical expenses?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,430.66,438.232,"Your Honor, I believe the judge imposing judgment following that jury verdict would have to conform the verdict to the law."
2012.12-98,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,451.89,469.018,"What's the difference between that case and Ahlborn, where you have -- where the State has agreed that a certain amount is attributable for medical expenses, and then this hypothetical that the jury has determined that a certain amount constitutes medical expenses?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,470.454,480.059,"In the jury verdict scenario, the State's not a party to that and didn't commit to the -- to the portion that -- that was attributable to medical expenses."
2012.12-98,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,508.412,526.04,"Isn't the reasoning of Ahlborn that when we know to a certainty how much the medical expenses were and what -- what part of the judgment this represents or the settlement represents medical expenses, then only that much can be assigned to the government?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,529.575,539.014,"The verdict situation would depend upon what -- would be in the hands of the parties to the lawsuit, what evidence was presented, what -- what theories were advanced."
2012.12-98,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,543.835,546.454,"Well, but it can -- it can participate in that process, can't it?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,548.254,557.075,--The State can initiate a lawsuit on behalf of its -- its medical claim by virtue of the subrogation and the assignment of the right.
2012.12-98,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,571.502,572.319,I'm sorry.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,572.319,578.473,"--here 1.9 million, and the 33 percent cap would have no application."
2012.12-98,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,583.96,588.262,"General, you were -- you were telling me a little bit about the history of this statute."
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,592.38,615.579,"Your Honor, historically 33 percent or three times the medicals was the -- the rule of thumb used in tort actions that -- that parties used that as the methodology, the way to come up with a value to the case, with the theory being 33 percent for the medicals, 33 percent for attorneys' fees and 33 percent to the victim."
2012.12-98,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,618.031,621.999,"If that's where it comes from, then it does relate to a kind of estimate, doesn't it?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,621.999,623.851,--Historically it does.
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.277,649.133,Can I ask you a somewhat technical -- and I appreciate your paying attention because it's hard for me to keep all this in my mind.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,710.287,711.623,"No, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.623,712.573,Oh.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,757.402,767.793,"Your Honor, the statute applies to settlements or judgments received by a Medicaid recipient from a third party."
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,767.793,775.565,"I know, but in the settlement they stipulate that 10 percent is for medical and the rest for pain and suffering."
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,788.789,790.491,"That is not true, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.491,791.425,They have decided?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,791.425,795.043,The North Carolina Supreme Court in the Andrews case said--
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.043,795.56,Said.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,795.56,799.431,--said that the key point in Ahlborn was the stipulation--
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.431,800.797,It has nothing to do with Ahlborn.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,844.293,846.495,"--Your Honor, I'm not aware of any such case."
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.495,846.828,Okay.
2012.12-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.213,853.565,Don't you think the statute may -- may give you the answer?
2012.12-98,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.799,883.335,You answered the question with respect to jury verdicts.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,888.822,890.555,"I would agree, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.323,893.573,I didn't hear Justice Ginsburg's question.
2012.12-98,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,893.573,913.704,"The question that Justice Breyer was asking about the 10 percent has already been answered because we were told that if a jury allocated 10 percent to medicals, it would not make any difference, the statute entitles the State to 30 percent."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,913.704,920.543,Basically you are saying the judge would be required to give you your one-third regardless of what the jury said.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,920.543,921.626,--Exactly.
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,925.162,940.087,"So all those States that have jury verdicts, special verdicts that require a certain amount, they could avoid that by just simply passing this law and avoid the anti-lien statute that way?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,940.087,948.507,"--Your Honor, it would -- it would depend how the State could rationally defend their statute under their experience as consistent with their jurisprudence."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,952.145,957.799,16 States already have something close to a presumption of a percentage.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,967.155,973.308,"--Your Honor, I don't have any evidence as to the specific performance in those 16 States."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,989.651,994.988,"In the absence of this statute, what did your State do beforehand?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,994.988,997.924,--This statute dates back to 1988.
2012.12-98,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1007.613,1016.218,"General, on your theory am I correct that the North Carolina legislature could amend this statute tomorrow to make it two-thirds?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1016.218,1020.42,--Certainly a statute could be amended.
2012.12-98,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1024.039,1024.657,But that's what I mean.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1032.995,1035.113,"--Two-part answer, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1057.128,1059.378,I guess I'm not sure I got that.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1090.015,1101.221,"I would say, Justice Kagan, the reason it's not the same is that it would treat Medicaid recipients decidedly differently than other tort litigants in North Carolina."
2012.12-98,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1118.0,1126.022,"But you're saying there's a kind of side constraint, that Medicaid recipients have to be treated like others, but then presumably, the State could change everybody's?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1126.022,1131.426,"--I -- I believe that would be the case, yes."
2012.12-98,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.4,1154.606,"I thought -- I thought your brief says that at some point, if it gets too high, you do have a problem under these anti-lien provisions of Medicaid?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1154.606,1168.015,"I -- I believe, Your Honor, in response to the 90 percent or 100 percent scenario or hypothetical, I would certainly posit it would be difficult for a State to defend--"
2012.12-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.015,1168.532,Why?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1217.282,1226.054,"--Your Honor, under the general lien statutes in Chapter 44 of the North Carolina general statutes, Sections 49 and 50 are the two provisions that we cite."
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1240.029,1241.647,Can I go back for a second?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1335.923,1336.692,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1360.039,1360.474,I see.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1360.474,1367.044,"Therefore, there was a stipulation binding the State, the lienholder, that controlled in Ahlborn."
2012.12-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1367.044,1370.746,You say a prior determination or stipulation.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1379.019,1391.16,"I think later in the Andrews decision, you will see a reference to the parties certainly had the opportunity to negotiate with the State a lesser amount than -- that the amount of the statutory lien."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1394.945,1407.519,"Am I correct that what you believe and what the courts have been doing in your State, the lower courts, is that they won't approve a settlement that doesn't have the one-third, and they won't enter a judgment that doesn't have the one-third?"
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1408.771,1422.714,"Your Honor, when there's a lump sum settlement in -- in these, the court directs the attorney for the recipient to enforce the statute to protect the State--"
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1422.714,1423.231,So I'm right.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1428.952,1433.754,"--Here, the State court ordered the $933,000--"
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1433.754,1434.856,Just answer my question.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1434.856,1435.372,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1435.372,1435.939,All right.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1453.733,1456.383,"They have to enter a judgment, yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1456.383,1456.951,And that's what they have been doing.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1456.951,1457.851,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1468.826,1473.111,Could I ask you how often this comes up in North Carolina?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1479.365,1484.003,"Your Honor, I've tried in the briefs to indicate the dollar amounts involved."
2012.12-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.88,1520.776,"I don't want to take up too much time talking about Andrews, but it seems to me that what the North Carolina Supreme Court said in Andrews is that in those States where there is a prior determination, that controls, but North Carolina is entitled to adopt a different procedure and have a one-third across-the-board rule."
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1521.794,1523.428,"Well, certainly, that--"
2012.12-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1523.428,1527.698,Does that accord with your understanding?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1527.698,1530.649,"--Your Honor, I think they were saying two things."
2012.12-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1532.016,1532.499,Yes.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1532.499,1542.771,"--and that in North Carolina, this is the rule, and that the prior determination also could include an action involving binding the State of North Carolina."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1542.771,1544.39,I know that was argued before.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1570.589,1573.124,I'm sorry.
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1573.524,1582.246,I don't see the North Carolina procedure referenced in Ahlborn as something that States could do.
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1593.721,1602.144,"--Your Honor, the holding in Ahlborn said you can't go beyond the amount represented -- that represents repayment for medicals."
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1609.75,1619.355,"But my point is, Justice Kennedy's question was that somehow in that opinion, we approved the North Carolina system."
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1619.355,1620.921,"Your Honor, I think--"
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1620.921,1623.673,Is there a direct reference to North Carolina's system--
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1623.673,1624.342,--Absolutely--
2012.12-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1624.342,1628.727,--in that or in any of the amici brief that talked about different State rules?
2012.12-98,0,31703,john_f_maddrey,,1628.727,1629.913,--Not that I'm aware of.
2012.12-98,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1633.698,1634.381,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1638.75,1644.923,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-98,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1711.031,1715.499,"Mr. Browning, let me give you a different rationale for this statute."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1764.064,1778.906,"Well, Your Honor, I would turn to the language of the Ahlborn decision which makes clear that States cannot lay claim to more than a portion of a settlement or judgment that represents payment for medical care or medical expenses."
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.873,1782.375,"Yes, but that doesn't answer the question."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1787.595,1797.301,--It is the State saying it is one-third even though there is no basis and even though you have cases like this where it's clearly not one-third--
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.301,1799.487,"Yes, but what the State says is the law."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1802.855,1830.772,"--Your Honor, if that is all North Carolina had to do, of course, the Ahlborn decision would have been dramatically different if Arkansas had simply enacted a cap of 100 percent or 50 percent or 40 percent, because in the Ahlborn decision, the State of Arkansas was only seeking to recover 39 percent of the tort settlement."
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.788,1857.674,"So you need, ultimately you need an adjudication."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1907.672,1919.914,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think it is very easy for states to follow that and to put in practices or procedures that result in appropriate allocation of medical expenses."
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.914,1921.016,How do you do that?
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1921.016,1921.599,Yes.
2012.12-98,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1924.218,1928.27,16 are doing it already.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1928.27,1929.205,Absolutely.
2012.12-98,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.897,1946.064,How does it work?
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.78,2019.813,"Well, but it's worse than that."
2012.12-98,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.42,2031.937,Exactly.
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2032.872,2033.189,Sorry to--
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2033.189,2038.057,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I first can turn to your point and then respond to Justice Breyer's question."
2012.12-98,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2038.057,2038.426,It's the same point.
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2038.426,2039.143,--It's the same point.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2039.143,2054.269,"Well, let me say this at the outset: That first of all, it is our position that the parties simply can't stipulate or reach an agreement that somehow deprives the State of their interest."
2012.12-98,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2061.34,2062.641,How does it work in those States?
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2062.641,2067.676,"Yes, Your Honor, and Justice Breyer, I don't think it's all of that complicated."
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.676,2068.528,I don't understand.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2083.486,2085.454,What should be adjudicated--
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.454,2087.74,"It seems to me it should be the latter, shouldn't it?"
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2087.74,2096.511,--What should be adjudicated consistent with the Ahlborn decision is the portion of the settlement that represents payment for medical expenses.
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.797,2099.98,That's right.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2110.605,2112.138,"--Your Honor, I don't think--"
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.138,2113.39,And they say 1 penny.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2114.523,2119.461,--We would not assert that the parties' subjective belief is necessarily binding.
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.461,2119.794,"No, no."
2012.12-98,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.261,2121.361,But I am asking the same question.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2125.365,2127.015,"Yes, and in most of those--"
2012.12-98,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2127.015,2128.75,I don't want to know that they have it.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2138.422,2155.65,--How it really works in those States is the States will generally negotiate with the State Medicaid agency and come to a fair allocation without the necessity for a judicial determination that's appropriate.
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2155.65,2156.617,What about fair?
2012.12-98,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2156.617,2162.388,Is that because they know they are going to be subject to a hearing if they don't reach an agreement?
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2162.388,2163.004,Yes.
2012.12-98,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2163.004,2166.256,So there is an inducement for them to do what this State didn't do.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2166.256,2167.608,"Correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2167.608,2170.06,"When told to come in, they ignored it."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2177.713,2178.915,"Exactly, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2178.915,2179.682,Exactly what?
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2179.682,2188.771,It levels the playing field so that there is an incentive on both sides to come to an appropriate allocation.
2012.12-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2188.771,2190.89,"Well, how is this allocation not happening?"
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2190.89,2193.842,"I was going to say, how do we know what's fair and appropriate?"
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2227.996,2244.108,"Your Honor, it is a process that the courts can determine based upon the experience of the judge, who generally would be very experienced in the valuation of cases, can make an appropriate decision, and can consider all the facts, the equities--"
2012.12-98,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2244.108,2247.477,"Counsel, do judges do this in non-Medicaid cases regularly?"
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2247.477,2248.277,"--Oh, absolutely."
2012.12-98,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2257.0,2264.105,"Let's deal with what appears to be many of my colleagues' gut instinct, okay?"
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2288.221,2289.254,--Your Honor--
2012.12-98,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2289.254,2293.708,--that this bottom line allocation is always going to be wrong somehow.
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2293.708,2295.675,"It's -- it's a little better than that, but go ahead and answer."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2296.409,2310.734,"--Justice Sotomayor, the -- the concern, of course, is that -- forgive me, I've lost my train of thought here, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2310.734,2320.442,"Well, this is what I envision happening, if the -- if the parties can't -- if the State and the -- and the recipient of the -- of Medicaid assistance can't come to an agreement."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2345.973,2351.727,"Your Honor, that is -- that is certainly an approach similar to Ahlborn, a proportionality sort of review."
2012.12-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2362.769,2364.971,That seems very -- that seems really very complicated.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2364.971,2365.354,--Well--
2012.12-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2365.354,2373.243,"How can a judge -- where the case is settled and the judge doesn't really know anything about the proof, how is a judge going to be in a position really to do that?"
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2373.243,2394.073,"--Your Honor, it is a matter of the parties coming forward, presenting evidence as to the damages in the case, perhaps an explanation as to why the case settled for less than full value, and the court using their experience to determine is this appropriate, should there be any reductions and of course--"
2012.12-98,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2394.073,2394.906,Is that -- is that what happens?
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2406.298,2408.666,"--Yes, in the context of third-party liability."
2012.12-98,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.666,2418.521,"How does it work for workers' compensation recoveries that have the same thing, they -- they owe the State for the medical."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2418.521,2419.621,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2451.093,2455.295,"Counsel, in those proceedings, are witnesses called or is it usually done on papers?"
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2455.295,2460.182,"--It's usually done in a fairly expedited process, yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.182,2467.621,"--You know, putting -- putting it in the discretion of the court, as you say is done in the workmen' compensation, is quite different from what you're proposing here."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2489.218,2490.018,I think it needs to be--
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2490.018,2491.154,That's a totally different question.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2491.154,2493.704,"--Justice Scalia, I think it's an objective determination."
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2510.881,2519.821,You've said several times that the way you do this is based on the judge's experience and so on with -- with the cases.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2550.792,2555.394,--There would be nothing wrong with a rule that creates a presumption.
2012.12-98,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.15,2590.567,So you're -- you're satisfied with the presumption.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2596.221,2614.949,"--Your Honor, I certainly think in this case the fact that the United States Department of Health and Human Services has filed an amicus brief that points out that this sort of ill rebuttable presumption, this sort of--"
2012.12-98,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2614.949,2616.001,I know that's their position.
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2633.262,2640.266,"--Your Honor, I think it would be appropriate to give Chevron deference to the arguments of the United States--"
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2640.266,2642.385,"Well, we're dealing with a North Carolina statute."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2644.102,2645.32,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2654.926,2659.045,"Well, it can't be very clear because CMS took the opposite position before this case, right?"
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2659.045,2661.764,I don't think that they took the opposite position.
2012.12-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2690.433,2692.885,Could I ask you a question on this different point?
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2714.764,2733.11,"Your Honor, I think in the case of the anti-lien provision, that that would effectively circumvent the anti-lien provision and allow by the backdoor what we would contend would not be -- the State could not do directly."
2012.12-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2773.887,2779.591,Does Federal law -- did Federal law require your client to seek compensation for medical expenses?
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2779.591,2794.833,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe that there is a requirement that Medicaid beneficiaries would have to file a suit and try to recover medical expenses."
2012.12-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2794.833,2800.837,"So you could have -- could you have filed suit and disclaimed any -- any claim for medical expenses, you only want to be compensated for other things?"
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2800.837,2810.045,"If -- first of all, there would be some medical expenses that wouldn't be Medicaid, medical expenses that were incurred by the family."
2012.12-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.327,2852.789,"But it would be the defendant who's -- who's -- who's jiggering the system, I mean, not suing for the medical portion simply because the defendant knows that at least some of that portion, if not all of it, would -- would go -- would go to the State."
2012.12-98,1,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,2873.35,2889.311,"I don't think it would be a gaming of the system, Justice Scalia, if the State, based upon the statute, based upon its previous directives would expect the Medicaid beneficiary to seek recovery of those claims and to remit one-third to the State."
2012.12-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.444,2890.911,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2902.452,2904.987,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-98,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2915.545,2917.679,Could you move the microphone so it's a little closer to you?
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2917.679,2917.995,--Sorry.
2012.12-98,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2917.995,2918.331,Thank you.
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2918.331,2920.531,Is this better?
2012.12-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2920.531,2921.014,Yes.
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2921.533,2929.103,"So the States are not determining, they're not trying to reconstruct what the plaintiff's and the defendant's intent was in entering into the settlement."
2012.12-98,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.498,2948.683,Excuse me.
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2978.785,2993.795,"--Well, I think this Court established in Ahlborn that the beneficiary and the State, they respectively have interests in the settlement that arises from the fact that in the tort case the plaintiff has asserted claims for medical damages and for nonmedical damages."
2012.12-98,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.958,3035.622,"So -- so you're saying that the State can, in making this determination, in fact take away from a plaintiff who has recovered a -- a greater amount in medical expenses, or a lesser amount in medical expenses, can take -- take away that by determining how much should have been allocated to medical expenses, right?"
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3035.622,3038.741,The State does have some discretion to determine what the appropriate--
2012.12-98,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3038.741,3042.11,"So you're messing up the lien law anyway, no matter which way you play it."
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3042.11,3048.966,"--Well, I think Ahlborn establishes that we have to make some kind of division of the settlement, and when the parties haven't done it, there's no jury determination."
2012.12-98,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3103.766,3109.337,"Ms. Anders, could you please finish your response, when you said various States do various things."
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3110.956,3112.072,Certainly.
2012.12-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3142.677,3144.693,Is that a reasonable -- this is the Federal district court?
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3144.693,3145.712,That was the Federal district court.
2012.12-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3145.712,3146.995,So it's not a State procedure.
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3146.995,3148.747,Pennsylvania law.
2012.12-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3156.668,3161.389,"What if -- what if the other -- the parties I guess are coming in and saying, well, that's not how juries work."
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3172.928,3177.581,"--I think the Court could take that into account in allocating, yes, some--"
2012.12-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3177.581,3179.599,So how would it take it into account?
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3197.228,3203.965,"--Well, I -- this is positing a situation in which there's been a settlement rather than a jury determination."
2012.12-98,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3234.918,3248.428,"Do you agree -- do you agree that the only flaw in the North Carolina statute is that it's a fixed amount, and that if it were a rebuttable presumption it would be okay?"
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3259.801,3261.435,That's absolutely right.
2012.12-98,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3275.811,3279.799,"And in those rebuttal presumption States, can both sides come in and try to rebut it?"
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3290.238,3294.808,"I think in those States, it's just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the presumption."
2012.12-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3301.378,3306.699,"So this is a real, significant increase in the burden on the State under the Medicaid program."
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3323.626,3328.88,"I think what's more significant for our purposes is that 16 States plus D.C. have, and--"
2012.12-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3328.88,3329.982,"Well, yes, for your purposes."
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3355.447,3359.382,--I don't think that these States have found that it's a significant administrative burden.
2012.12-98,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3375.711,3378.312,How many States have North Carolina's rule?
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3378.812,3384.216,--There are -- there are five other States like North Carolina that have an irrebuttable presumption with a cap.
2012.12-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3396.94,3414.969,"Why isn't -- the missing part here -- maybe I just missed it -- we're interpreting a statute, and the part that trumps the lien provision is the part that says the State is entitled to payment that has been made for medical assistance for health care items -- and some other similar language is in the statute."
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3443.738,3451.594,"Well, we think that -- the position reflected in our brief is HHS's considered position, and we do think that it's -- it is persuasive."
2012.12-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3459.08,3465.668,"My impression is that you get Chevron deference on the basis of whether Congress -- and there's a lot of rules and so forth, that--"
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3465.668,3468.653,--We haven't claimed Chevron deference.
2012.12-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3468.653,3469.138,--you haven't claimed it.
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3470.804,3471.288,--there aren't regulations on this.
2012.12-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3471.288,3476.125,"--I'm not -- you argue what you want to argue, but I -- this is awfully technical language."
2012.12-98,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3478.577,3484.898,I'm not sure that HHS has -- has authority over how a State recovers.
2012.12-98,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3498.907,3506.894,"Well, HHS has -- the statute requires the States to -- to enact reasonable measures for recovery."
2012.12-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3514.333,3516.117,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-98,3,31703,john_f_maddrey,,3518.619,3534.061,"We have heard a lot about what a State could or maybe should do, but what must a State do under the Medicaid Act to fulfill its obligations?"
2012.12-98,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3554.892,3574.871,"Well, General, how about this, and I am having a little bit of trouble here because I think a State could come in, or I think there is a reasonable argument that a State could come in and say, you know, we've made an estimate, and here's our best estimate, and we don't think there is a need for an individualized decisionmaking on top of that."
2012.12-98,3,31703,john_f_maddrey,,3598.671,3608.962,"Your Honor, the statute -- North Carolina's statute defines the amount that must be included for the repayment by the Medicaid recipient."
2012.12-98,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3645.385,3655.24,"So how do -- what do we do with the Federal statute that says, You are not entitled to a lien of any amount that is greater than your medical expenses?"
2012.12-98,3,31703,john_f_maddrey,,3674.671,3680.558,--Because the State statute says the State never recovers more than its actual medical expenses.
