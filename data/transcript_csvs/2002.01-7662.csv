2002.01-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.56,122.729,"Well, now you... you... Mr.... Mr. Waxman, you've got two presumptions going against you here: the... the first, the Hernandez presumption that the trial court has to be deferred to, and then the AEDPA presumption."
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,124.958,127.559,"--I want to embrace them, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.954,390.7,"Well, but certainly demeanor could play a part in that even though you don't... you don't say it."
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,390.7,391.072,--I--
2002.01-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.072,402.506,"You say he's... he's prejudiced against the Government and, you know, perhaps the way he answered questions may give you a reason to think that, that the transcript doesn't."
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,402.506,405.85,"--I can... I... I embrace that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.4,451.425,"At... at what stage, Mr. Waxman?"
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,457.535,457.991,"Oh, no."
2002.01-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,531.551,534.151,How do we know... how do we know he didn't look at that?
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,534.151,539.352,--We... we don't know to a certainty that he didn't.
2002.01-7662,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,575.389,583.153,"But he did say, didn't he, when he admitted the... as you pointed out, when he admitted the... the newspaper article, that he'd take it for what it was worth?"
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,583.153,584.017,He did.
2002.01-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,641.314,655.266,"Before you get to the jury shuffle, how long before the... the voir dire in this case had the newspaper article surfaced?"
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,672.689,676.943,"--I'll address the newspaper articles first, I guess you were asking about, and also the manual."
2002.01-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,676.943,677.23,Yes.
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,677.23,680.946,The newspaper articles... there were two series of newspaper articles.
2002.01-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,780.596,782.249,And this trial was '85?
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,782.249,785.054,--This trial was '86 I believe.
2002.01-7662,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.556,854.323,"Mr. Waxman, could I just interrupt to ask one question?"
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,858.122,862.785,--The answer must be that they were put on at different times.
2002.01-7662,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.319,868.441,"Now, these are--"
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,868.441,880.041,Those had to have been put on before any questioning occurred because there... they are on those cards for jurors that were never reached or were never questioned.
2002.01-7662,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.574,953.147,"--If we agree... if we agree with your analysis of number 6, does that suffice to vitiate number 2?"
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,953.147,954.512,--I--
2002.01-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,954.512,961.692,That the... that the court finds that the explanations given by the prosecutors in each... prosecutor in each case were completely credible.
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,961.692,962.601,--I think it does.
2002.01-7662,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,967.348,967.348,That's the conclusion.
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,967.348,970.403,"--which is the... the finding, which is the ultimate finding."
2002.01-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.134,1077.901,"Are you saying... are you saying that the prosecutor on voir dire must ask, when he gets to the question of, you know, how do you feel about... must ask the same questions to every juror?"
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1077.901,1078.727,--Not at all.
2002.01-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.813,1092.927,"Well now, wait a minute."
2002.01-7662,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1101.101,1103.33,--I think I... I managed to confuse even myself.
2002.01-7662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.33,1103.33,Good.
2002.01-7662,1,25031,gena_a_bunn,,1768.903,1773.195,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-7662,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3458.905,3459.527,Thank you.
2002.01-7662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3560.381,3560.381,"Thank you, Mr.--"
2002.01-7662,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3560.381,3561.003,It is that--
