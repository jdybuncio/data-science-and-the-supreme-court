1967.630,0,23605,frank_j_barry,,21.487,24.702,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,484.837,492.771,"Well is that -- Do I understand that means that the Department standard is present profitable marketability, is that it?"
1967.630,0,23605,frank_j_barry,,492.771,493.508,Only --
1967.630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.508,501.61,"As opposed to the Ninth Circuit thought, if there was some future hope of profitable market, is that it?"
1967.630,0,23605,frank_j_barry,,501.61,516.859,The Ninth Circuit has indicated in its opinion that what was required by us was an actual showing that there had been minerals marketed at a profit at the time that the application is made.
1967.630,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,557.629,559.014,We will recess now.
1967.630,0,23605,frank_j_barry,,561.404,579.56,..discussing before the recess the fact that this particular stone that is found on this claim has not been -- is not marketable in the area of Southern California where it's located.
1967.630,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,624.966,625.761,Gross?
1967.630,0,23605,frank_j_barry,,626.676,628.36,That appears to have been his gross.
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1471.581,1476.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?"
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1698.408,1703.208,"Well, Mr. Twitty, may I ask you this question?"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1721.984,1733.154,"Your Honor, we have pointed out that under the Building Stone Law, it says that “you can locate and you can go on the lands, enter the lands for lands chiefly valuable for building stone."
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1740.136,1745.978,But does that mean that the building stone has to be valuable?
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1745.978,1748.498,Chief; it says “chiefly” valuable.
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1824.193,1828.505,"Now, do you agree that that applies to building stone?"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1828.505,1844.916,"If the Court rules that -- our argument that just showing building stone chiefly valuable, I mean the lands chiefly valuable for building stone is enough to obtain patent."
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1855.759,1861.145,So that -- and let me see if I will get a little more clarity on my own mind.
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1880.746,1891.142,We have urged that that is a proper construction of Section 30 U.S.C. --
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1891.142,1906.026,"In other words, that if the land is absolutely useless except for the building stone and the building stone in totality for the -- for all of the claims as worth a thousand dollars, you would say that's enough."
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1914.403,1919.589,That is if you adopt our theory that you can look just to Section 30 U.S.C. 16--
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1919.589,1922.849,"And there's no precedent to your theory, is it?"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1922.849,1931.278,There is no Court precedent and I have already advised the Court and I think there are Interior decisions adverse to that position.
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1931.278,1931.675,Yes.
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1931.675,1951.941,"I think the -- our basic contention in this case, unless if that argument is not accepted, the basic contention is that the prudent-man test applies to this at the test of discovery on these claims."
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1952.979,1960.928,"Well, the Solicitor, by correctly understand him, braced with that, doesn't he?"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,1960.928,1965.924,He did not agree with it.
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2007.427,2028.172,"I thought he said that test that they applied here was a prudent-man test; that is to say that it must be a deposit or in your case, in occurrence of building stone which the characteristics of which are such that a man of ordinary prudence would spend his time and money to develop it."
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2028.172,2028.346,That is the --
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2028.346,2034.535,And then you said that I understand them to say that that is to test him; that's test was applied here.
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2068.594,2082.726,"The Solicitor, as I understood him, had as an additional test for -- on this building stone cases a test of present marketability."
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2314.346,2324.533,"You’re saying that their brief, the government Brief says that present marketability is or is not the proper test."
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2324.533,2332.173,"As I read their opinion, they say that they do not use the word “present marketability” but that in substance is what they're saying."
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2332.173,2335.501,You're talking about their opinion or their brief in this Court?
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2335.501,2335.71,The government's brief.
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2335.71,2342.299,Brief in this Court.
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2342.299,2343.361,"For example, the --"
1967.630,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2343.361,2351.485,What is the Court below relies on in saying that the government used that test?
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2351.485,2354.224,Used the present marketability as the test?
1967.630,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2354.224,2356.45,Present marketability.
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2367.07,2368.008,"Well, yes."
1967.630,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2488.826,2491.514,Where was that case reported?
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2491.514,2509.497,"52 ID 201; in other words and as we all know, the Oily Shale case is not yet in really commercial production but in '27, they said that -- these people were justified."
1967.630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.773,2541.995,[Inaudible] I thought was in this case.
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2544.381,2545.109,Which is used?
1967.630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.109,2549.195,"Whether or not the Court side or whatever the stone is, is this common stone within that --"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2549.195,2551.431,"Common variety, yes I will touch on that."
1967.630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.431,2561.15,"Now as I understand it, if we disagreed with the Court of Appeals on that issue, the case would be over with?"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2561.15,2561.658,On the (Voice overlap)
1967.630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.658,2565.834,Without -- its marketability and prudent-man arguments?
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2565.834,2566.646,"Yes, that's right."
1967.630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.646,2567.532,Is that true?
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2567.532,2569.048,"Yes, because that was --"
1967.630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.048,2580.078,"The government has two separate arguments here and one of them is this cut that building stone, that quartzite is common building stone and therefore is not patentable under the mining laws at all?"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2580.078,2581.027,That's right.
1967.630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.027,2586.53,"And if we agreed with the government on that, we never reach all these other issues?"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2586.53,2587.132,"That would be true, yes."
1967.630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.132,2588.798,"Alright, would you argue on it?"
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2588.798,2591.517,"Yes, I'm going to touch, Your Honor."
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2713.125,2752.874,"Well, anything in that opinion except to that effect as I accept the sentence that appears at the bottom, page 12 of the record – bottom of page 12 of the appendix that we have before us and that says that Coleman was required to show that by reason of all pertinent factors including the existence of a present demand before July 23, 1955, the deposit could be mined, removed and disposed of at a profit."
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2761.874,2775.057,"The beginning of that paragraph, it states “The only issue in dispute at the hearing on September 16, 1958 was the existence of a market for profitable sales before July 23, 1955”."
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2801.276,2816.841,"Well, they are certainly saying that that is a pertinent factor and that's I -- it seems to me quiet clear that this is not a model of precision, this language that you and I have been discussing."
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2837.915,2838.94,"Where was that, Your Honor?"
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2838.94,2840.887,Page 12 of their brief.
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2859.067,2882.139,"In this case, in the government's brief which you refer to, they have pointed on Page 12 too -- first of all, at page 17 they say that “the prudent-man test and the profitable marketability test are not essentially distinct standards."
1967.630,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2885.323,2893.747,"But there, they are talking about perspective marketability as they make clear, I think that was where in particular at page 12."
1967.630,1,28256,howard_a_twitty,,2893.747,2905.371,"As I read the government's brief, they do not concede that perspective marketability is an applica -- is proper in testing whether there is a valuable mineral deposit."
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3303.816,3306.011,May it please the Court.
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3438.689,3440.376,I don't believe that's quite --
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3440.376,3441.26,I beg your pardon?
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3441.26,3443.144,"I don't think it's quite that, Mr. Barry."
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3449.406,3449.79,Fine.
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3450.081,3462.603,"And that the standard you used in your opinion, I have to say is -- was not expressed with the typical Interior Department clarity."
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3462.603,3463.026,Alright.
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3464.855,3466.568,"No, you didn't get it."
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3479.063,3480.496,Of the brief or the opinion?
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3480.496,3481.63,"No, the record, the appendix of the record."
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3481.63,3483.281,Alright.
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3546.942,3548.264,I don't agree with you.
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3549.833,3549.974,I beg your pardon?
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3549.974,3573.493,"It's quite conceivable as a theoretical matter anyway that no evidence could have been adduced to show that there was a market on or before July 1955 but that the evidence might have been present, showing that to a reasonably prudent man, this building stone might be saleable in a year."
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3573.493,3574.288,"Alright, fine."
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3574.779,3575.836,Isn't that conceivable?
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3575.836,3604.13,"That point is well-made and if that point had been in the record, the language that to be consistent with the rule of the Department of Interior has got the language that has been used in this case might have been modified to say something like this: whether there was before July 23, 1955 evidence that the stone would be marketable, not in the present but possibly in the future."
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3604.13,3606.051,"That's a very different matter, that's right."
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3606.051,3607.134,"Alright, but the evidence in this case --"
1967.630,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3607.134,3613.638,And I think that's what -- I think when you and I are talking about now is what true at the Ninth Circuit.
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3613.638,3615.232,"Well, I don't know."
1967.630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3618.81,3621.711,[Inaudible]
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3621.711,3624.648,"Now, I do want to say something about the question of the Chief --"
1967.630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.648,3625.902,[Inaudible]
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3625.902,3627.011,"No, it is not."
1967.630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3676.575,3684.375,[Inaudible]
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3684.375,3688.175,"No, it doesn't apply to any kind of stone whether --"
1967.630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3688.175,3688.925,[Inaudible] variety of stone.
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3688.925,3692.505,"Alright, let me tell you what it means."
1967.630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3694.362,3695.189,[Inaudible] Act?
1967.630,2,23605,frank_j_barry,,3695.189,3696.741,"Alright, fine."
