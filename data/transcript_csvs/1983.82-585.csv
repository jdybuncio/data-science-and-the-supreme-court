1983.82-585,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.396,"Mr. Griffith, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,62.396,65.254,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-585,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.662,299.833,"How about a next income tax, Mr. Griffith?"
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,299.833,305.018,"Subsection (b) expressly permits a net income tax, Your Honor."
1983.82-585,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.018,309.078,Is there all that much difference between a gross income tax and a net income tax?
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,309.078,310.218,I think there definitely is.
1983.82-585,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,327.196,332.553,"Well, you say that a gross income tax is necessarily one on the passenger?"
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,368.805,369.178,Yes.
1983.82-585,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,369.178,373.678,--Is that appreciably different from a net income tax similarly reflected?
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,373.678,376.895,"Very definitely different in concept and theory, Your Honor."
1983.82-585,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.895,377.738,How?
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,377.738,383.892,Because a net income tax depends on many other factors besides the price of a ticket.
1983.82-585,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,398.619,408.085,"Now, the act does not prohibit, I gather, a property tax or a franchise tax to be levied by the state."
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,408.085,408.975,That is correct.
1983.82-585,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,408.975,421.049,And what reason would Congress have to forbid the use of gross receipts as a measure for imposing a property tax or a franchise tax?
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,421.049,422.065,Because Congress--
1983.82-585,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.065,423.659,If the amount is the same?
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,423.659,440.667,"--Congress was very much concerned about the price of air fares, and the fact is that Congress as part of an overall federal program levied an 8 percent federal excise tax on air fares."
1983.82-585,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.343,477.964,"Well, I know that is what you have argued on the purpose, but if the state can get the same revenue and just label it something else, it is little hard to understand the position."
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,477.964,483.257,"I am saying, Your Honor, that the states cannot reach the same revenue through another label."
1983.82-585,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.257,490.584,"Well, now, Congress has amended the law in a way that doesn't apply to the tax years in question here."
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,490.584,491.146,Yes.
1983.82-585,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.146,499.064,"But they have since amended it, and they have created a new exemption for in lieu taxes."
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,505.032,514.981,"No, it would not, Your Honor, because Congress left the two key sections we are talking about, (a) and (b) of Section 1513, undisturbed."
1983.82-585,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,542.735,554.354,"Mr. Griffith, if you should prevail here, is there anything to prevent the state from turning around and levying even a higher income tax on your clients?"
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,554.354,563.663,"Nothing whatsoever except the usual constitutional guarantees against unequal treatment, but otherwise nothing whatsoever."
1983.82-585,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,563.663,567.053,But you might win a Pyhrric victory then here.
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,567.053,570.27,"We are willing to take that chance, Your Honor."
1983.82-585,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,570.27,574.752,"That isn't the only kind of tax they could levy either, is it?"
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,574.752,576.643,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-585,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,604.898,615.127,"If you were entirely an intrastate airline, didn't fly over international waters, you would have no case here, would you?"
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,615.127,616.799,"We would have a case, Your Honor."
1983.82-585,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1037.379,1037.723,Mr. Griffith--
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,1037.723,1038.207,--Yes.
1983.82-585,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1038.207,1042.424,"--The airlines over a number of years accepted this tax, didn't they?"
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,1042.424,1045.313,"Your Honor, we did not."
1983.82-585,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1045.313,1048.874,Your client didn't.
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,1049.576,1050.951,"Our client did not, yes."
1983.82-585,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1050.951,1052.232,--You represent Aloha?
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,1052.232,1053.341,Aloha Airlines.
1983.82-585,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1053.341,1055.667,"Well, did you file protests every year or something?"
1983.82-585,0,39358,richard_l_griffith,,1056.089,1062.509,We have protested and contested the tax back to the first effective year.
1983.82-585,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.144,1396.406,Mr. Dexter?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1396.406,1400.077,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-585,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1428.424,1437.608,"Mr. Dexter, you will speak about the language of the statute, won't you, because I have gone through your brief and I do not find it quoted anywhere."
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1437.608,1437.967,Yes.
1983.82-585,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.123,1522.573,"Mr. Dexter, you didn't mention in responding to Justice Blackmun, or at least I didn't hear you--"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1522.573,1522.839,--What?
1983.82-585,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.839,1532.257,--That the prohibition is not just on taxing the sale of air transportation but goes as they are on the gross receipts derived therefrom.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1532.257,1545.658,"But on the gross receipts derived therefrom, Your Honor, as far as the legislative history history is concerned, is traceable to a discriminatory Ohio tax on singling out airlines."
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1600.636,1603.26,"Well, is this a gross receipts tax?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1603.26,1604.963,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1610.914,1612.35,It's a tax on gross receipts.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1612.35,1614.708,"--Well, it's a general utilities tax imposed--"
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1614.708,1616.802,"On what, gross receipts?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1616.802,1626.015,"--It's on the franchises, the business, the going concern's values of the property the same as the old utility taxes on railroads or other utilities."
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1626.015,1627.796,It's not on gross receipts.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1627.796,1628.234,No.
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1677.339,1679.37,Then how is that measured?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1679.949,1683.602,It is measured by the gross income--
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1683.602,1684.446,Receipts.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1684.446,1686.195,--of the utility.
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1686.195,1687.273,"Oh, so this is a gross income tax."
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1687.273,1689.522,But it is measured by the gross--
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1689.522,1691.022,And it is different from gross receipts.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1691.022,1694.989,"--Well, it's... we don't quibble with--"
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1694.989,1701.048,"Well, don't you require them to report their gross, ""their gross receipts""?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1701.048,1703.219,"--Yes, they are required--"
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.219,1707.733,And then you say that is not a gross receipts tax.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1707.733,1710.997,--It is not a tax on gross receipts.
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1710.997,1712.216,I have problems.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1712.216,1722.321,"Okay, but if you look... if you look at what they are trying to measure, Your Honor, they are trying to measure the value of the franchises."
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.364,1739.503,"Well, Mr. Dexter, they don't say anything about the value of the franchise in the statute itself, do they?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1739.503,1745.592,"--Well, the... it says doing business, but if you look at the definition of public--"
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.592,1751.231,And it says there shall be leveled and assessed upon each airline a tax of 4 percent of its gross income each year from the airline business.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1751.231,1754.621,--But as... but it is a franchise... if you look at--
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1754.621,1755.558,It is really something else.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1755.558,1758.931,"--If you look at a utility, a definition of a public utility--"
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1758.931,1760.43,"Well, what definition of public utility?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1760.43,1784.827,"--It is in Section 269-1 of the Hawaiian statutes, you can see how they are talking about trying to get at measuring the going concern value of utility property in the State of Hawaii, and it is not what we consider a traditional tax on gross receipts."
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1785.733,1786.733,Is that statute quoted in the briefs?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1786.733,1786.904,What?
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.904,1787.857,Is that statute quoted?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,1787.857,1798.697,"No, it is not, and we would... there are some supplemental statutes we want to refer to here in the argument, if I get to it... and we would be glad to furnish a supplemental appendix to the court."
1983.82-585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.901,2034.382,"But none of them pay the federal 8 percent transportation tax, do they?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2034.382,2037.366,"Well, Your Honors, neither do the airlines here."
1983.82-585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.676,2047.33,"Well, I just, nevertheless, none of them have to charge their customers the 8 percent."
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2047.33,2049.158,"Well, this is true, Your Honor."
1983.82-585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.158,2050.002,Okay.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2050.002,2050.439,This is true.
1983.82-585,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.932,2084.004,"Mr. Dexter, that argument would carry considerable weight if the claim here were that the tax on your... the levy by Hawaii violated equal protection, but it is that it violates a specific prohibition in an act of Congress."
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2084.004,2104.574,"Well, we think... well, let... we think that (a) is talking about specific excise taxes where airlines have been singled out for discriminatory treatment such as the Ohio excise tax."
1983.82-585,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.574,2109.493,"But it just certainly, its language just doesn't bear that construction, do you think?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2109.493,2118.067,"Well, if you look at (b), I mean, just step back from the language, what was Congress trying to get at in (a)?"
1983.82-585,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.072,2152.897,"No, gross receipts tax on air transportation is a tax of general applicability, don't you think?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2163.893,2172.718,"--Well, but what I am saying is that if you had... for instance, take the problem of the net income tax you raised."
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2243.564,2250.623,Am I wrong that the purpose of this tax was to build the airports?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2250.623,2252.934,"Yes, this is true."
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2252.934,2256.542,"And if they didn't build them, you'd have to build them, wouldn't you?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2256.542,2262.712,The local governmental units would have had to try to... or states would have to try to do it.
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2262.712,2263.337,Sure.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2263.337,2264.836,"But you see, what we have here--"
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.836,2269.226,Your real problem here is that gross receipts doesn't mean gross receipts.
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2269.226,2272.428,"--Well, my real... no, my--"
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2272.428,2272.99,Isn't that your problem?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2272.99,2283.673,"--That is not my problem because I can distinguish very much between a public utility tax, you know, a general utility tax--"
1983.82-585,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2283.673,2292.215,"Well, so far as I am concerned, I will take on the problem if what a gross receipt is or happens to be."
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2292.215,2306.616,"--Well, even if this were a gross receipts tax, the question is, is it the type of gross receipts tax Congress was directing its attention to in 1513(a)?"
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.772,2402.531,"Mr. Dexter, supporting that you had a... say you win this case, and there is another state that doesn't have the same history of taxing in the way you say Hawaii always has, but just decides, well, since Hawaii can impose this tax, I think it's a pretty good idea, let's impose a gross income tax in the language of the Hawaii statute."
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2404.405,2408.294,"Your Honor, we have said in our brief two things."
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.623,2447.948,Even if their new statute I described is in exactly the same language as the Hawaii statute?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2447.948,2451.963,"--If it were... no, but if it were, if it were, included everything--"
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.963,2457.867,"Concerned about airlines, certain carriers: there shall be levied and assessed upon each airline a tax of 4 percent of its gross income."
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2469.66,2474.704,"--Well, I think you have to look to see whether airlines have been singled out for discriminatory treatment."
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.595,2479.016,How do you tell that other than by the fact the statute applies only to airlines?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2481.42,2485.154,"--No, but that is part, that is part of the public service company tax."
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.565,2516.359,What if they imposed a property tax measured by $10 per passenger flying on the aircraft?
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2516.359,2524.856,"Well, I think that that would... that would obviously be, in my judgment, an indirect head tax."
1983.82-585,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.856,2527.605,"Well, why isn't this an indirect gross receipts tax?"
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2527.605,2533.899,"That's been in effect since 1933, or companion bills to that."
1983.82-585,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.899,2776.629,"Well, the trouble is the statute says the tax will be on gross income, and that sounds like the subject to me."
1983.82-585,1,44427,william_d_dexter,,2776.629,2792.888,"--Well, but then it turns around, Your Honor, and says it is a means of taxing the personal property of the airlines, including the tangible and intangible and going concern values."
