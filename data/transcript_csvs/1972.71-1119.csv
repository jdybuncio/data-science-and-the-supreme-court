1972.71-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,3.976,Mr. Diamond.
1972.71-1119,0,20725,darrel_k_diamond,,3.976,7.22,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,36.264,47.731,"Before you move further Mr. Diamond it would help me if you clear up the situation, the factual situation."
1972.71-1119,0,20725,darrel_k_diamond,,65.84,70.391,Are you referring here Mr. Chief Justice to Mrs. Burney's case if it is a General rule?
1972.71-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,71.644,79.348,"Well, somewhere in this massive material, I got the impression that the division officer in this case --"
1972.71-1119,0,20725,darrel_k_diamond,,79.348,80.192,In this case --
1972.71-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,80.192,93.358,-- have reversed -- had been reversed by the appeal board and that the benefits denied by the division officer were then granted.
1972.71-1119,0,20725,darrel_k_diamond,,93.358,102.564,They had in fact been granted much earlier on the basis of the preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order issued by the district court.
1972.71-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,166.121,169.427,And then what happened?
1972.71-1119,0,20725,darrel_k_diamond,,169.427,172.04,At that time her case was completed.
1972.71-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.341,238.428,She is the only named plaintiff within this subclass?
1972.71-1119,0,20725,darrel_k_diamond,,238.428,241.368,Yes she was.
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2363.047,2368.094,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2396.792,2403.73,(Inaudible) to get the same problem again in both those cases?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2403.73,2405.148,In Java and Goldberg?
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.148,2407.303,Huh huh.
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2407.303,2410.748,It would be true as much in this case as it was in Java.
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.738,2431.206,You got any other reasons says that this is a good case in (Inaudible).
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2431.206,2431.752,Pardon.
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2431.752,2436.664,Any other reason that says this is a case in controversy as off now?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2436.664,2438.762,"Yes, and as we do it as always --"
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2438.762,2442.619,Wouldn't it been much easier to intervene somebody?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2442.619,2449.361,"Well, I think Your Honor after the -- after the injunction was issued, it did cover the entire class."
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2453.927,2458.682,Any number of that class could intervene?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2458.682,2466.273,"That could have, except that after the injunction was issued they were all receiving the benefits of the order."
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2472.09,2476.461,Why couldn't they intervene to protect that?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2476.461,2477.215,There is one answer-
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2477.215,2484.947,"As I understand the law of class action is any member of the class can intervene at any time, am I right?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2484.947,2485.653,Yes.
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2485.653,2489.441,"Why hadn't somebody, why had no body intervened?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2489.441,2491.035,"The problem is that, they didn't --"
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2491.035,2496.232,"It's actually just not as to say that, you don't have to insist on that?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2496.232,2509.69,"No Your Honor, the reason no one intervened is because they were receiving the benefits of the order and as long as their benefits were not being terminated without a hearing they had no reason to intervene."
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.69,2511.712,Who do you represent then?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2511.712,2520.292,I represent Mrs. Burney and all members of the class as defined by the lower court.
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2595.656,2600.843,But in this case she is no longer eligible to anything?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2600.843,2602.534,Not on this particular claim.
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2602.534,2607.148,"She is now not a member of the class, am I right or wrong?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2609.156,2617.854,"The Class is defined as all present, future recipients of unemployment compensation benefits in the state of Indiana."
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.854,2620.325,And she is no longer eligible?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2620.325,2624.282,She is not eligible on the basis of that particular claim.
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.282,2626.676,"Well, how is she a member of the class?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2626.676,2628.637,She would be a member of the class as a --
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2628.637,2632.274,My question is how is she a member of the class as of now?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2632.274,2638.056,"To the extent that it covers future recipients of unemployment compensation benefits, she could be."
1972.71-1119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.056,2641.749,"Well, that is everybody employed in the whole state, is in that class."
1972.71-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2646.603,2648.972,Including the deputy attorney general?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2648.972,2659.338,Possibly.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2692.736,2695.184,(Inaudible) in Java?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2695.184,2696.49,Exactly Your Honor.
1972.71-1119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.892,2703.679,Or do you mean Goldberg?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2703.679,2712.957,"Goldberg on the constitutional issue, Your Honor, Goldberg reached the constitutional issue involved in the welfare situation."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2712.957,2725.335,Do you say the eligibility factors are the same in this kind of case as in a welfare case under Social Security?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2725.335,2728.617,There are different eligibility criteria.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2771.654,2775.656,(Inaudible) exclusively public fund?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2775.656,2776.834,"That is one reason, Your Honor."
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2785.667,2787.654,I wonder why that is.
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2791.535,2804.783,"That is one way, Your Honor and the other way is we must remember we are dealing with people who are working as opposed to welfare where this Court recognized that there would in effect be no recoupment."
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.783,2821.394,"Well, I take that one of your propositions is that the Indiana method of determining initial eligibility for compensation does not comply with Goldberg against Kelly."
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2821.394,2832.517,"Now, Your Honor, we're not dealing as the court below pointed out, we are not dealing here with claimants found initially ineligible."
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.517,2833.962,"Hold on, I will ask you if this."
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2844.256,2849.445,"No, that comports with the procedure outlined in Java for determining --"
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.445,2860.63,So you don't think that the procedure outlined in Java for determining initial eligibility for unemployment compensation would pass muster under Goldberg against Kelly?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2860.63,2862.715,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.715,2871.692,So a fortiori it wouldn't for a redetermination?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2871.692,2879.214,"When we are talking about, when we're talking about a redetermination, in other words, when we are talking about now taking that recipient off, that is correct."
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.634,2901.363,"Let's assume that the court disagreed with you, that the procedure outlined in Java for determining initial eligibility would pass muster under Goldberg against Kelly?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2901.363,2902.596,Would I agree with that?
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.596,2911.724,"No, no, let's assume the Court, that is what the Court would hold, then would settle this case?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2911.724,2940.512,"If the court were to hold that, I assume that we are -- however, we are saying that those procedures are (1) do not comply with Goldberg; (2) they are not sufficient even under the Act because at this point, we must remember that what the program is all about, the program as pointed out in Java is to get benefits to unemployed workers when they are unemployed and not six months later when they are back to work."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2951.526,2968.253,Isn't this program different from Social Security in that there is an affirmative burden on the unemployed worker to prove every week that he is complied with these standards.
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2968.253,2974.264,"The same burden rests on the welfare recipient, Your Honor, as pointed out in Java."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2975.084,2980.198,Are they required to come in with new proof every week and sign a new certificate every week?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2980.198,2991.111,"They are not required to come in with new proof to the extent that – you know, they have to demonstrate compliance with the rules and regulations."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2998.016,2999.511,"That is not true here, is it?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,2999.511,3001.453,"It is true, Your Honor."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3011.961,3016.954,If provided -- provided a number of things are demonstrated each week?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3016.954,3017.694,That is correct.
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3018.347,3026.193,"(Voice Overlap) semantics, but there is a real difference, is there not, between the unemployment and the welfare in that sense?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3039.734,3048.53,"Similarly, Your Honor, the welfare recipient, for example, must prove he/she is not working, must show that the children are still living in the home."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3048.53,3055.479,What kind of a certificate does the welfare recipient sign every week?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3055.479,3062.269,"The welfare procedure, the welfare system does not use the same procedure, in that there is not a signing."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3071.574,3076.198,"Well, there is an affirmative decision in, the other is a negative?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3076.198,3087.505,"I think they are well, they are both affirmative to the extent that the obligation is on the recipient to in effect say, I am still eligible."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3096.74,3102.028,"Well, in the most places, their welfare check is mailed, is it not?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3102.028,3103.699,"That is my understanding, Your Honor."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3103.699,3109.628,And in any case is the unemployment mailed?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3109.628,3111.579,"I think it is in some states, Your Honor."
1972.71-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.804,3126.067,"How about in Indiana, whether it is mailed or requires personal appearance there?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3126.067,3132.172,"As a general rule in Indiana, it requires personal appearance each week as was indicated earlier."
1972.71-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3141.328,3144.143,You don't get it when you come into the office for your appearance?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3144.143,3149.29,That is correct.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3255.189,3257.165,"She was initially declared eligible, was she?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3257.165,3258.333,That is correct.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3258.333,3269.286,"Now suppose what would be your position if as to the application of Goldberg, if her initial determination was ineligible?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3269.286,3271.951,That was a different situation under Goldberg.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3271.951,3272.796,What were you thinking?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3274.941,3281.75,"I think a footnote in Goldberg specifically indicated, they were not dealing with the initial application process that --"
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3281.75,3284.393,"I know we were not, of course, in Goldberg."
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3293.687,3298.929,Whether there is a right to a hearing before a denial?
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3298.929,3299.454,That's right.
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3311.067,3314.474,"No, it would only be a subsequent hearing in that case."
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3314.474,3326.093,"And then suppose you would take an appeal from the initial determination of ineligibility, you took an appeal, would you – the claimant be entitled to benefits pending decision of the appeal?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3326.093,3330.298,Not if initially determined ineligible.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3333.146,3339.279,"Here, however the situation is Mrs. Burney was in fact initially declared eligible?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3339.279,3339.754,That is correct.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3339.754,3343.455,And determine to be ineligible in some subsequent week?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3343.455,3344.086,That is correct.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3344.086,3346.766,And it is in that connect that you mention Goldberg claim?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3346.766,3347.372,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3347.372,3349.488,Since she did not have an adequate hearing?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3349.488,3350.551,That is correct.
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3360.336,3364.709,Your class limited to those who had been declared initially eligible?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3364.709,3368.092,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1119,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3381.314,3385.341,Why do you insist so on her eligibility for 22 weeks?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3396.076,3398.633,That is the initial determination of eligibility.
1972.71-1119,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3426.385,3432.105,"By that you mean so long as she complies with the conditions, will continue in eligibility?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3432.105,3434.66,That is correct.
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3434.66,3436.805,Which must be determined every week?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3442.233,3444.134,"Yes, we disagree with that."
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.134,3454.281,"But if -- to the extent that that is a defensible position, then you are going to get into trouble?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3454.281,3460.742,"Yes, but I think it is clearly not a defensible position when we look at the program."
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3495.748,3503.089,"It just means that the second and the third and the fourth week, he doesn't have to prove as many things as he did the first week?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3503.089,3503.526,That is --
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.526,3515.992,"(Voice Overlap) that is he -- all he has to demonstrate the first or rather from the second week on, he doesn't need to re-demonstrate the nature of his severance from his employment?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3515.992,3531.508,That is correct and in addition he doesn't have to demonstrate the ensured status and as in welfare then the recipient remains eligible as long as the rules and regulations are complied with.
1972.71-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.508,3547.117,"Isn't then eligibility that merely means that he is part of a class of people covered by the statute, not that he is entitled to something, but through his private class which may be entitled to something, if they can prove all these things they must prove each week?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3547.117,3557.682,"That is one aspect of the initial -- that is the ensured status determination, but the second and most important determination is an individual determination."
1972.71-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3563.603,3599.819,"In the coal, Indiana Coal Provision, that are cited at the very end of the jurisdictional statement, they may be cited in your brief too, Section 2 (d), where it says, in addition to the fore growing determination of insured status by the Division, the Deputy shall throughout the benefit period determine the claimant's eligibility with respect to each week for which he claims waiting period, credit or benefit rights."
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3606.642,3613.44,"Yes, but I think this is simply a description of how Unemployment Compensation Benefits are paid."
1972.71-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3638.153,3642.992,"Our affirmance in Torres was correct, can you prevail here?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3642.992,3654.921,"Well, I think in dealing with Torres, first thing we have to discuss is the fact that the case is actually pending before this Court now on a petition for rehearing."
1972.71-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3665.87,3668.848,"You mean us in affirming it, I rake it?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3668.848,3684.275,"I think one of the, as indicated and it is still pending on rehearing and to the extent that there is an affirmance on the identical issues raised by plaintiff Dinger we would disagree."
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3684.275,3692.32,"As I understand, Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question is how can you prevail?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3692.32,3717.595,"Insofar, as the Torres decision raises the same issues and I must point out, there are some distinctions, especially on plaintiff Torres where there was a very unusual circumstance involving the initial determination, but insofar as the issue is exactly the same as raised by plaintiff Dinger, we would disagree with that affirmance."
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3717.595,3723.353,"Suppose we let it stand, how do you stand that?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3723.353,3731.058,"Well, I think the -- we have to keep in mind also that that was a summary affirmance and the Court did not consider the --"
1972.71-1119,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3731.058,3738.857,"Well, really, doesn't this come back down to that, without overruling Torres, you have real difficulty into that."
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3738.857,3745.09,To the extent that the issues were exactly the same.
1972.71-1119,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3745.09,3755.916,"I think Justice Brennan and I would know that without asking you that to the extent the issues are exactly the same [Attempt to Laughter] you would in trouble, I mean, to what extent are the issues not the same?"
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3755.916,3764.178,They are not the same to the extent that in that case the plaintiff Torres presented a very unusual circumstance to the Court.
1972.71-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3849.373,3864.783,The Goldberg argument only becomes really a cutting if you are right in saying and in maintaining that this weekly determination is not a determination of initial eligibility?
1972.71-1119,1,28496,ivan_e_bodensteiner,,3864.783,3869.033,Yes.
