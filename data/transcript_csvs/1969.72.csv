1969.72,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.293,"Number 72, Coleman and Steven against Alabama."
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,42.798,52.367,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,248.612,253.148,"You got to tell us, I hope -- what's your argument?"
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,257.634,257.802,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,257.802,259.461,-- brief and what happens there?
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,259.461,266.962,"Getting to it right -- in just a moment, if Your Honor please I've listed 17 reasons in my brief."
1969.72,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,280.701,285.646,"Now, let me clear up one thing from my own situation."
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,297.756,298.324,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.876,326.089,This is -- this is not the same minimal.
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,328.464,329.63,"That's a very confusing case, if Your Honor please --"
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.63,330.818,That was an arraignment.
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,330.818,334.384,-- they called in an arraignment and then the Court talks about a preliminary hearing --
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.384,336.965,"But there was in fact an arraignment at the indictment, was it not?"
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,336.965,338.025,It wasn't arraigned.
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,338.025,338.795,After indictment?
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,338.795,339.15,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,339.15,339.867,Or information.
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,343.142,344.955,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.814,353.199,Right.
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,353.199,354.035,Then comes the trial.
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,354.035,356.323,And was the arraignment that was involved in Hamilton?
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,356.323,356.653,Yes.
1969.72,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,356.653,360.304,"All right, thank you."
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,360.304,370.369,"It's understandable however that the Hamilton case is confusing, because of the preliminary -- being called a preliminary hearing and really is not, it's an arraignment, where plea is required."
1969.72,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,449.023,456.665,"Well, let me ask this if I may interrupt, did you say to examine the witnesses against him?"
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,462.734,469.427,All other witnesses produced at the hearing and all of the witnesses subpoenaed by the defendant to testify in his own behalf.
1969.72,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,476.973,481.187,In this respect then its parallels of the federal situation?
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,481.187,481.951,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.72,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,545.511,553.356,"Well, are you suggesting that the Alabama Statute contemplates that the preliminary hearing is to be a discovery mechanism?"
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,553.356,558.469,"It says, if Your Honor please, that it is to determine probable cause and to --"
1969.72,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,558.469,559.794,Probable cause for what?
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,561.061,563.695,To bind the defendant over to the grand jury.
1969.72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.406,579.622,"Mr. Tarter, what's difference between this preliminary hearing and the 937 Hamilton?"
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,579.622,584.749,"In Hamilton, the case was in arraignment and not a preliminary hearing, if Your Honor please."
1969.72,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.589,587.86,"When is the arraignment, today?"
1969.72,0,20218,charles_tarter,,588.897,592.732,The arraignment comes after the preliminary hearing and subsequent to the indictment.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1421.061,1426.081,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1488.717,1492.232,"Doesn't anybody get out on bail, except in the big cities?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1492.232,1494.13,"Oh, if they wanted and they can request."
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1499.29,1502.525,"Well in this case, did the petitioner asked for a preliminary?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1502.525,1504.085,He did ask for preliminary.
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1504.085,1504.925,He asked for it.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1504.925,1513.098,"I think that is correct sir. He asked for a preliminary hearing and it was had on October 14, 1966."
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1513.098,1515.498,The record will show that he asked for it?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1515.498,1519.038,I think that is correct sir.
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1519.038,1520.058,But he didn't have a lawyer?
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.058,1524.604,Without the preliminary hearing?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1524.604,1528.384,"You may, you could file a -- and get that and they would say they --"
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.384,1534.148,Was their rule that doesn't have preliminary you can not get --
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1534.148,1543.508,"It could be said by the judge or the clerk of the Court sometime in the small amount of misdemeanors and so forth, but if a --"
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.508,1544.348,You said that the --
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1544.348,1545.188,A serious offense.
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.188,1547.108,"The reason they have under, is to bail."
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1547.108,1549.667,Is to get bail in a more serious offense.
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.847,1553.627,Why -- why is that so?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1553.627,1559.507,To get -- that's the only way they can get it in a most -- the law said to that sir.
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.507,1563.167,"The law says that unless you have a preliminary hearing, no bail?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1563.167,1577.267,"No, it sets out the Title 15, Section 138 and 139-40, I think sets out the ways of having a preliminary hearing to set bail."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1577.267,1581.527,"100 -- 140, on page of 4 of the petitioner's brief, is the one that--"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1581.527,1581.957,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.957,1583.577,Imposes the duty to --
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1583.577,1583.937,If it's a bailable offense.
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.937,1585.925,The large amounts bail payments --
1969.72,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1585.925,1589.164,I thought your friend told us that sheriff occasionally set bail?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1591.431,1596.925,That's in very minor misdemeanor cases.
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1596.925,1610.507,One of the -- what was indicated to -- I want to know that the prosecutor could pick a case directed to the grand jury rather than having a preliminary hearing?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1610.507,1627.307,"If the accused does not asked for a preliminary hearing, Your Honor, then, when the grand jury meets, the matter maybe presented to the grand jury, and indictment returned, and then of course, you have the arraignment entry."
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.307,1635.167,"But if the accused said I waived of preliminary hearing, he is also waiving bail?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1635.167,1636.907,"In effect, yes sir."
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.907,1637.447,He is?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1637.447,1640.462,That's right.
1969.72,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1640.462,1645.082,"Can he secure bail after the indictment, by applying to the Court?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1645.082,1646.273,"Yes, sir, he did."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1655.262,1658.142,At the time of arraignment?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1658.142,1658.76,"No, sir."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1665.231,1666.509,Where you plead guilty or not guilty?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1666.509,1667.349,That is correct sir.
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.349,1669.149,Or it opposed any other defenses.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1669.149,1670.589,That's correct.
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1670.589,1676.649,An answer to an indictment and then the trial starts two minutes after that in your state?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1676.649,1677.189,"No, sir."
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.616,1694.052,"Mr. Clark, is there some other reason for the preliminary examination other than bail?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1694.052,1703.008,"Well, If thats the -- if Mr. Tarter pointed out, if there has been on offense committee, if this particular person accused is the one who --"
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.008,1704.988,There is something more than just bail.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1704.988,1705.828,"Oh, yes."
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1715.683,1720.858,What about protection about reducing all these to writing?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1720.858,1732.548,"That is a matter as Mr. Tarter has pointed out that is required in the code and there is a provision that is not done, the magistrate could be fine."
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.28,1737.96,You mean sometimes it's fine and sometimes --
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1737.96,1740.6,"No, no I -- as a recording of the preliminary hearing."
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.6,1742.767,I see.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1747.207,1753.595,I think it is just as Mr. Tarter has pointed out that defense attorneys have it done.
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1770.134,1773.614,But the state didn't provide it.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1773.614,1774.634,No.
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.634,1775.534,Defense --
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1775.534,1777.574,In defense in that case.
1969.72,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.88,1784.104,"This defendant couldn't pay it for, you agree on that?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1784.104,1786.084,I don't know this one matches.
1969.72,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1844.008,1845.208,Give me those pages again.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1845.208,1846.672,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1859.748,1862.634,"Why was decided by this Court in Pointer against Texas, wasn't it?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,1862.634,1865.214,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.843,2175.763,What are you arguing now?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2175.763,2181.045,"On the merits of the case, to show that the lineup was alright."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2489.617,2491.602,Where did this lineup take place?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2491.602,2492.502,In Birmingham.
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2492.502,2494.149,"Well, in Birmingham, but where?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2494.149,2496.429,And I believe in the city jail.
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2496.429,2497.179,Inside?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2497.179,2498.049,"Yes sir, it was inside."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2498.049,2499.789,Four walls and a roof.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2499.789,2505.009,"Yes, as I point out there was -- they're saying about four feet high that they walked across this stage."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.009,2505.759,"In a room, inside."
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2505.759,2508.219,"In a room, yes sir."
1969.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2508.219,2509.911,What building did you say?
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2509.911,2512.491,I believe it was Birmingham jail.
1969.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2512.491,2513.268,Birmingham jail.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2513.268,2515.008,"Yes sir, in Birmingham."
1969.72,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2515.008,2519.328,"And does the record show, what kind of a hat this was, this man wore?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2519.328,2519.544,"No, sir."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.54,2526.786,Was it -- does it show that was the same hat that he was wearing at the time of the --
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2526.786,2530.386,"No sir, if that were (Voice Overlap)."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.377,2558.761,"Move his hat down, down (Voice Overlap)?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2558.761,2564.182,"He see, with hat down first, so he had to move his face, so he had him pushed it to back of his head."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2564.182,2569.942,"And at the time of the offense, was he testified he had it down or up?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2569.942,2581.444,"Since you mention, it wouldn't -- he said he saw his face at the time that the Coleman grabbed Mr. Reynolds' wife, and he said he was three feet away from him."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2586.734,2592.745,"From where, where these man brought into the lineup from -- from where were they brought?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2592.745,2599.449,"They were from the Birmingham area, I think they gave their addresses here."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2599.449,2608.263,"Well, I mean directly, from where -- they came into the lineup, this (Voice Overlap) these petitioners came into the lineup from where?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2610.523,2629.958,"I know that two or three of them were definitely arrested, let's see -- somewhere in the record, there is a evidence that I believe it was Coleman and Hudges were arrested on escape charges from the city."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2645.587,2658.423,"Well, I'm just -- I'm interested in your theory that this man just had a habit of wearing a hat, 24 hours a day, inside, outside, and I just wonder if when they came into the lineup --"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2658.423,2659.574,He had a hat on.
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2659.574,2662.793,"He had a hat on, where did he come from at that time?"
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2663.151,2666.042,"No, he -- no, he was in the jail, inside at that time."
1969.72,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2666.042,2669.315,Your suggestion is he just wears a hat all the time.
1969.72,1,20689,david_w_clark,,2669.315,2682.014,"Yes, I realized that's unusual, but some people do have few habits a way -- And as I point out, no way does he say, “They made me put a hat on.”"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,2953.075,2957.881,May it please the Court.
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2975.187,2977.538,I didn't quite hear you.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,2977.538,2978.014,I beg your pardon?
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2978.014,2979.834,I didn't quite hear you.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,2979.834,2994.834,"I said that was the first opportunity I ever had to see the man on the witness stand or to talk to him in any fashion, whatsoever at the direction of the district attorney, would not talk to him beyond any circumstances."
1969.72,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2997.558,2998.739,But you did cross examine the --
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,2998.739,3006.484,"I did cross examine him, but what am I to cross examine him with, if Your Honor please, I had no transcript, I had not prior testimony, no statement."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3021.138,3025.513,But if -- of course many times they have to do it without having a prior statement.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3025.513,3026.081,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3031.71,3032.548,Sometimes.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3032.548,3038.299,"Sometimes, yes sir."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3079.374,3081.183,What do you say that was?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3081.183,3089.117,"It's in the appendix, if your Honor please, I have it cited numerous time and during the course of my brief."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3122.992,3125.978,Did you put your client on the stand?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3125.978,3127.516,During the trial of the case?
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3133.738,3137.08,"I wonder why it's lost, while your walking into this courtroom?"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3137.08,3159.489,"If Your Honor please, the publicity in this case and the fact that we're unable to examine the eye witness in the case, before getting into the courtroom, without any preparation whatsoever, it just -- all we could do was cross examine the eye witness and that was about it."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3168.948,3170.75,"What was the defense, not guilty?"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3170.75,3172.704,The defense was not guilty.
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3179.629,3182.102,No alibi defense?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3182.102,3184.875,He was with his mother and with his sister.
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3184.875,3186.084,Did you put that up?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3186.084,3187.19,"No, sir."
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3222.25,3239.453,"What's the purpose of the preliminary hearing, as I understand it is to ascertain whether or not there's probable cause to bring to -- probable cause to think that an offense has been committed and this is the man who committed,--"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3239.453,3239.588,Yes.
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3239.588,3240.046,-- is that right?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3240.046,3240.944,"Yes, that's correct."
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3240.944,3267.831,"And it's just been an adventitious use of -- by defense counsel that sprung out to take advantage of that for their own benefit, it isn't designed really for the purpose of later impeachment or discovery at the -- or particularly for the purposes of getting a transcript with those witnesses to impeach him later, it's purpose simply is to -- is what I stated, is it not?"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3267.831,3269.606,To determine probable cause.
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3269.606,3273.451,"Right, that an offense has been committed, and if this is the man who has done it."
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3273.451,3274.583,"That is correct, that is the primary --"
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3274.583,3279.803,"And if so, then his held for the grand jury and march or not bail for the meantime, is that right?"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3279.803,3282.153,"That is the primary purpose of it, if Your Honor please."
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3282.153,3284.413,It's the only purpose.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3284.413,3305.163,"What does probable cause consist of, if Your Honor please, probable cause in the motion to suppress, dealing with arrest or search and seizures, an extremely complicated problem, and I'm sure Your Honor would not say that counsel is not necessary in a probable cause situation on a motion to suppress in a confession or in a arrest or in a search and seizure."
1969.72,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3318.744,3321.766,But you can move these things later counsel.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3328.447,3331.464,"Yes sir, of course my client remains in jail, until we're able to get --"
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3331.464,3338.675,I have not understood your argument to be that if counsel had been there.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3359.173,3373.821,"That is correct, it could be, but of course it also possible, I suppose anything is possible, that the could have dismissed them, I don't know what this eye witness would have said at the preliminary hearing, ten days after they were arrested, that's what I'm saying."
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3382.628,3384.075,"And you don't know what did happen, do you?"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3384.075,3387.352,I don't know what did happen at the preliminary hearing.
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3388.596,3395.063,"Now, if you prevail here, there cannot possibly be a retrial and another conviction, can it?"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3403.422,3403.901,That's correct.
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3403.901,3404.847,"So, this man -- these people have --"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3404.847,3406.316,The same as -- the same as --
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3406.316,3406.815,-- discharge.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3406.815,3410.343,"That's true as in other case, of course, with this Court have decided."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3411.955,3415.966,What do you have said should be the result?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3415.966,3417.057,The result --
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3417.057,3422.089,"If this was found, he's entitled to have a lawyer on the preliminary."
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3422.089,3427.626,"If he was entitled to have a lawyer in the preliminary hearing, I assert that they should be turned loose."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3427.626,3430.046,Is that the only alternative you can suggest?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3430.046,3437.339,"It's the alternative, only alternative I can see, if Your Honor please, there's no way to give us a new and fresh preliminary hearing."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3448.093,3449.435,Why not?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3451.599,3456.164,"Well, that the testimony is now -- the eye witness is now committed, you see."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3485.713,3487.691,Did you offer that evidence?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3487.691,3488.089,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3489.751,3495.121,"You offer that evidence, to show the jury that he had made such statement?"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3495.121,3496.918,"Yes, we did."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3497.265,3500.759,Was it admitted?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3500.759,3505.333,As best as I can recall it was -- I think he denied it.
1969.72,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3542.691,3546.933,"And that he identified both of these petitioners, as being his colleagues that night?"
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3546.933,3561.008,"He said that both of them were there and John Hudge, another individual who was in the lineup, Ode Stevens testified -- Ode Stevens, one of the defendants testified at the trial that John Coleman was not there."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3580.924,3587.296,"Was it -- that the stated taken this case before the grand jury, wouldn't have done it that was anything before trial."
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3587.296,3590.404,"That's correct, if Your Honor please, they don't do it in 95% of the cases."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3590.404,3593.051,And you don't deny that they have the right to do that in Court?
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3593.051,3595.497,I don't deny that they have a right to do it.
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3611.152,3613.189,Could I ask you one more question.
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3613.189,3614.427,"Yes, sir."
1969.72,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3614.427,3623.618,"Apart from what you argue might have been done, at the aid of this event."
1969.72,2,20218,charles_tarter,,3646.421,3665.269,"I don't think so, if your Honor please, there was the question brought up by Justice Stewart just a moment ago, with regard to the fact that Pointer versus Texas pointed out that if a statement was made at the preliminary hearing, that it could not be used against him at the trial without lawyer, but I suggest to you that here is the point that the Court has failed to see."
