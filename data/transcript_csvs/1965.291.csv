1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,36.599,40.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,123.384,133.667,May I ask you if the -- if that seemed to have (Inaudible) mandatory sentence?
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,133.667,136.271,I think there's a minimum fine.
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,136.271,147.261,Because (Inaudible) shall be fine or fined or (Inaudible) by not less than 30 days within the year
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,147.261,147.467,I --
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,147.467,155.896,"Does that means, if it's an offense that the (Inaudible) mandatory?"
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,155.896,160.128,"That issue of course isn't here right now but I don't think it necessarily means that, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,185.497,187.159,(Inaudible)
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,187.159,188.449,"Yes, he must be fined."
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,193.576,195.589,Whether or not it was accidental as the (Voice Overlap) --
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,195.589,195.88,Yes.
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,195.88,197.501,-- to the facts here.
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,197.501,197.572,Yes.
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,197.572,198.487,Is that right?
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,198.487,204.124,That's right.
1965.291,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,442.897,448.482,Are you asking this for a per se rule?
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,448.482,453.773,"We think this -- we think that the statute in effect requires that, yes Mr. Chief Justice.We think that the statute said --"
1965.291,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,453.773,463.86,"Is that why you stipulated that this was accidental, you didn't attempt to show any negligence or anything, but you stipulated that it was accidental."
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,471.057,471.944,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1965.291,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.556,527.965,"What do we suppose to say if -- that the District Court was wrong, and now reverse?"
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,527.965,531.939,"The District Court was wrong and the case is reversed for trial, yes Mr. Justice."
1965.291,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.939,533.85,You never -- supposed to say what's the right rule (Voice Overlap) --
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,533.85,542.226,"Well, the right rule is that -- yes, the right rule is that refuse matter includes valuable as well as valueless material."
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,548.136,548.331,"Well, you sum --"
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,548.331,548.773,Now --
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,548.773,552.326,"You sum it up, I guess at page 5 in this one sentence, don't you?"
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,559.819,560.259,That's right.
1965.291,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,561.464,562.356,That's your position.
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,562.356,563.525,That is exactly our position.
1965.291,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,569.645,576.397,"If this goes back for trial, are you precluded from showing this is negligence have caused this?"
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,576.397,578.005,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1965.291,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.015,629.051,"I think you have to prove that, negligence or carelessness."
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,629.051,630.959,I think we can prove it here.
1965.291,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,639.519,644.951,Because of the opening language of the Section 13 I suppose.
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,668.5,670.327,Although that question isn't here now.
1965.291,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.512,670.729,No.
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,670.729,673.033,I think that that's a fair reading of the statute.
1965.291,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,684.507,702.283,"Suppose the pipe just corroded and the gasoline escaped, would you contend that they suffered this to be done and that the statute applied it?"
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,702.283,705.882,Not if we couldn't find any fault Mr. Chief Justice.
1965.291,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,709.892,710.831,"Yes, and if the --"
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,710.831,721.102,"But if the pipes had been checked and they were in good order and they just broke on their own, I think it'd be quite hard to read the word suffers encompassing that kind of conduct."
1965.291,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,721.102,744.019,"Well, that's what I add when I asked if you're on the per se rule because it's one thing if they left that valve opened negligently and that the gasoline be discharged, it might be entirely another thing if the pipe corrodes for instance and broke and then the gasoline poured out."
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,744.019,744.752,"Oh, we agree, we'd --"
1965.291,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,744.752,747.069,You're not asking this to go that far.
1965.291,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,747.069,747.543,No.
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,1666.649,1671.046,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.291,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1826.622,1843.041,Do I understand your brief that you interpret the statute as if the Government is right imposing this criminal liability however it gets into the stream accidentally --
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,1843.041,1843.242,Yes sir.
1965.291,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1843.242,1843.981,-- or other way?
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,1843.981,1845.152,That's my position.
1965.291,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1845.222,1853.992,"Well, does that go so far for example as supposed -- suppose there's some youngster that come along and turned this thing open."
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,1856.205,1858.502,All I say is -- excuse me sir.
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,1889.955,1906.757,"Criminal liability without fault and that's one of the issues that we will subsequently urge is all the more reason that the language must be precisely read because the only protective provision of this statute is the limiting adjective, refuse."
1965.291,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1951.675,1973.183,"Mr. Hadlow, I purport your statement that this is an obstruction statute only, seems to me I've read the number of instances where they have prosecuted ships for discharging oil in a navigable stream or a bay."
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,1976.785,1982.166,"-- those prosecuted Mr. Chief Justice, under the Oil Pollution Act of 1924."
1965.291,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1982.166,1982.595,"Yes, not under --"
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,1982.595,1986.541,There's a later section of this same Act.
1965.291,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2020.87,2028.78,Did you say that that part of the statute expressly excludes accidental discharge of oil?
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,2028.78,2031.843,Yes sir and under the Oil Pollution Act of 1924.
1965.291,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2031.843,2036.114,Which you say is now incorporated as part of this statute?
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,2036.114,2040.292,"But not the one we're proceeding under, that's another separate section of this Title."
1965.291,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2040.292,2041.061,Of the same Title?
1965.291,1,22495,earl_b_hadlow,,2041.061,2042.227,"Of the same Title, yes sir."
1965.291,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3478.79,3479.717,May it please the Court.
