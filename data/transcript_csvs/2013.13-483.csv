2013.13-483,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.89,"We'll hear argument next in Case 13-483, Lane v. Franks."
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,4.718,7.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-483,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,89.167,99.804,What if it -- what if the person who testified had the definite job responsibility of investigating possible corruption in the agency?
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,102.834,104.366,--If--
2013.13-483,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,104.366,108.926,When would the testimony be -- be within the scope of the person's job duties?
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,108.926,113.282,--I think it would depend on the circumstances of the particular case.
2013.13-483,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,164.996,179.788,"Well, just to follow up on that, could there be ever a situation in which a government employee's testimony is within the scope of that employee's duties if the employee is not -- does not testify on behalf of his employer?"
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,179.788,181.787,I think that there is--
2013.13-483,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,181.787,192.61,"If the employee is subpoenaed by -- by the opposite side, then you would say that's enough, that makes the testimony outside the scope of the employee's responsibilities?"
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,192.61,193.641,--I think that would be strong evidence.
2013.13-483,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,218.116,224.41,"So I think you're -- let's use the quintessential example, police officers or lab technicians."
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,237.529,246.869,"--Your Honor, in those cases I think there would be an argument that in every case they are acting in the scope of their duties if you consider the practical circumstances that give rise to that testimony."
2013.13-483,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,288.556,305.299,"So what happens in a situation where a police officer gets on the stand and in testifying honestly admits to corruption, admits to -- or does it in a slovenly way, comes to court dressed in a clown suit?"
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,309.25,315.748,"--I think the answer is almost certainly yes, and that occurs through the application of the Pickering balancing test."
2013.13-483,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.2,364.165,Is there any -- would there be any Pickering balancing in this case?
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,364.165,366.695,If this Court--
2013.13-483,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,366.695,374.973,"If the Court says that speech is protected, would there be any need to go on these facts into a Pickering balance?"
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,374.973,391.013,"--Your Honor, we don't believe that in the summary judgment record there is any evidence that my client's speech was at all disruptive, and that's why the United States has argued that if you perform the balancing test here yourself you can find in our favor."
2013.13-483,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.246,412.271,But we are asked to decide the qualified immunity and how can we find there is no qualified immunity in view of the Morris v. Crow decision?
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,412.271,416.098,We think the Morris decision is plainly distinguishable.
2013.13-483,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,441.259,443.322,That means the Eleventh Circuit is wrong.
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,456.831,464.594,"--Your Honor, I would be willing to concede, if the case were clearly on point, that qualified immunity should perhaps nevertheless apply."
2013.13-483,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,528.131,532.941,Is there a different Eleventh -- Is there a different Eleventh Circuit case he should have looked at?
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,539.422,541.062,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, there is."
2013.13-483,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,545.811,548.482,"Yes, but it was expressly distinguished in Morris."
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,548.482,553.229,But it was distinguished only on grounds that would also distinguish this case.
2013.13-483,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,571.706,573.222,"Well, why should we get to that question?"
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,579.407,583.452,"I'm sorry, I think the qualified immunity question was decided below."
2013.13-483,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,594.977,595.571,I understand.
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,595.571,597.884,And so the issue is squarely before you.
2013.13-483,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,617.469,618.953,We might have to send it back.
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,632.727,633.915,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.915,638.725,"And so they say obviously they didn't violate the Constitution, they didn't clearly violate the Constitution."
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,645.614,647.364,That's -- that's correct.
2013.13-483,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,648.848,657.939,"So if they got the whole thing wrong from beginning to end, they might have to send it back, send it back and say you got it wrong, it did violate the Constitution; now tell us if it's clear."
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,667.558,670.213,"--I think you should decide the question, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,688.707,690.3,Those are two very different things.
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,712.181,724.567,"In -- in Ashcroft vs. al-Kidd, this Court articulated the standard for qualified immunity as either there's controlling precedent in the jurisdiction or there is a consensus of persuasive authorities."
2013.13-483,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,748.245,755.305,"Well, if you say the Eleventh Circuit is out on its own, it seems to me to be a concession that their law is different from the law that you're arguing for."
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,766.722,774.282,"--Your Honor, our argument is that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong, but until this case, they weren't wrong enough to justify this result."
2013.13-483,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,802.427,806.815,"I go back to my point, which is they got it wrong."
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,818.935,822.762,I think an instructive case is Groh v. Ramirez.
2013.13-483,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,873.506,873.912,All right.
2013.13-483,0,62297,tejinder_singh,,879.816,881.003,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,916.114,917.052,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,929.827,931.749,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-483,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,972.779,973.185,Yes.
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,982.073,986.929,"--Your Honor, I think the example would be a police officer executing a warrant."
2013.13-483,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,989.382,994.956,"But my hypothetical is there is a subpoena, you are required to testify."
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,994.956,996.378,"--I think, Your Honor--"
2013.13-483,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,996.378,1001.861,And then you've -- you indicate that there are some matters on which the employee is not -- not protected.
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1001.861,1004.907,"--Your Honor, we think--"
2013.13-483,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1004.907,1005.985,What is an example of that?
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1005.985,1021.071,"--We think that, for example, a police officer whose job it is to investigate and testify about what he saw to support a warrant or something like that would be a situation which he could be subpoenaed by -- by the defense to testify, for example, and it would still be part of his job responsibilities."
2013.13-483,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1029.116,1029.865,So you could fire him because he testified?
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1029.865,1036.58,"--Your Honor, there is a range of discipline -- disciplinary activities that would be available to employees."
2013.13-483,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.877,1039.283,I -- I still can't get the hypothetical.
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1040.048,1041.36,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1041.36,1045.202,--I -- I just can't imagine a case that's not -- not a matter of public interest.
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1064.57,1065.038,No.
2013.13-483,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1116.032,1122.437,But what do we do if the subpoena is not to the government and if the subpoena is just to the particular person?
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1135.432,1138.773,"Your Honor, because that's exactly what the Court held in Garcetti."
2013.13-483,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.488,1155.049,But that was Judge Kagan's qualification.
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1156.159,1163.203,"--Your Honor, but this is -- that is, I think what we would -- that's what the -- the ACLU amicus urges, and we strongly urge the Court not to do that."
2013.13-483,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1169.435,1170.107,"Well, wait a minute."
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1186.146,1187.489,"--Your Honor, there is a--"
2013.13-483,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1187.489,1211.09,"That there's something -- you can be always fired for some other reason that the employer can point to under Pickering or otherwise, but what kind of message are we giving when we're telling employees, you're subpoenaed any reason in a trial, go and tell a falsehood because otherwise you can be fired?"
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1211.09,1217.071,"--Your Honor, if it's actual instruction to do a falsehood, there's a range of protections that the government -- that -- that are available."
2013.13-483,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1219.804,1225.646,You mean the Constitution doesn't protect someone in a trial from telling the truth?
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1229.988,1231.879,"--Your Honor, it is a matter of public concern."
2013.13-483,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1316.858,1320.762,"Well, Mr. Gershengorn, could I ask the question that I tried and failed to ask Mr. Singh?"
2013.13-483,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1346.938,1357.919,"--Your Honor, we don't think that you should send it back precisely because three judges -- for several reasons, but among them, that three judges below read their own precedent to say that this was not unconstitutional."
2013.13-483,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1470.982,1472.623,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-483,2,62298,luther_j_strange,,1477.543,1480.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-483,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1547.872,1555.824,Why should it matter then if an employee's job is to investigate corruption?
2013.13-483,2,62298,luther_j_strange,,1569.974,1572.13,"--Your Honor, I think it should."
2013.13-483,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1601.46,1603.038,But that seems counterintuitive to me.
2013.13-483,3,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,1609.27,1611.16,"Well, I wouldn't characterize it--"
2013.13-483,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1611.16,1612.848,To tell the truth about something?
2013.13-483,4,62298,luther_j_strange,,1618.423,1623.373,"Well, I agree with my colleague from the Department of Justice."
2013.13-483,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1633.323,1650.019,"--I certainly understand people -- the government being able to tell people don't go out and talk to the newspapers about this, don't go out and talk about X publicly, because we should be able to control those kinds of disclosures."
2013.13-483,4,62298,luther_j_strange,,1656.923,1665.856,"--Well, I think certainly as the top prosecutor in the State of Alabama, I expect and insist the value of the testimony is that they are telling the truth."
2013.13-483,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.108,1777.686,But what about the Martinez case?
2013.13-483,4,62298,luther_j_strange,,1787.261,1800.052,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you know, I think if you're in Franks's position or if you have employees like that, there may be reasonable variables -- maybe that case had made sense."
2013.13-483,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1826.915,1835.958,"So you think if every other circuit has come out the other way and you have what -- well, let's take the dictum."
2013.13-483,4,62298,luther_j_strange,,1845.799,1854.14,"I think they are protected, Your Honor, if they rely on the law of their circuit unless the law is clearly established by this Court."
2013.13-483,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.796,1893.593,"Thank you, General."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,1902.621,1905.135,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-483,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1970.296,1981.995,"Garcetti turned on what were -- what were the job duties of the particular person, and then the job duty was to investigate."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,1991.334,1994.488,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2061.665,2065.663,I -- I still don't understand or didn't understand what it is you're saying.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2077.955,2109.35,"--Your Honor, under the citizen analog test or inquiry that the Court began to articulate in Garcetti, if the testimony is factual, based solely on the job duties, as it was here, inseparable from the job duties, and it is information that a citizen would not know, that only the testifier would know, then that is not protected speech under Garcetti."
2013.13-483,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2117.673,2118.766,"Well, what is he -- what is he supposed to do?"
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2151.988,2161.062,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we would never suggest that anybody not comply with a subpoena, comply with an investigation, or testify truthfully."
2013.13-483,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2161.062,2165.046,But you are suggesting he can be fired if he does it.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2165.046,2173.136,"If -- if it does not offend the First Amendment, and we believe that's why we're here."
2013.13-483,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2184.491,2189.724,Is Garcetti right on that point as it relates to testimony?
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2202.015,2203.905,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2203.905,2213.994,"We've all agreed that getting fired for admitting something, doing it in -- in an improper way, a whole host of things can get you fired."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2224.335,2246.561,"Only, Your Honor, if the -- well, of course, as the Court observed in Garcetti, there's a powerful network of legislative enactments that -- that prohibit retaliating against an employee or penalizing an employee for testifying truthfully."
2013.13-483,5,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2299.007,2308.192,"But are you suggesting that when somebody learns something from his job, that that means it's not speech by a citizen?"
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2308.192,2317.749,--Only if -- it depends on the speech that -- that follows from knowing something on your job.
2013.13-483,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2358.061,2368.057,What if that -- what if the same information -- what if the employee writes a newspaper article or gives an interview and reveals the same information?
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2370.978,2374.59,"Well, it depends on the character of the speech, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2375.214,2377.838,"Well, what if it's about corruption in my government?"
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2386.06,2391.069,"--That sounds like -- that sounds like protected speech, as in Pickering, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2398.744,2406.735,"No, but when he's using factual matter that he only knows because he's an employee in a particular branch of government."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2406.735,2409.01,--Then that would not be protected speech.
2013.13-483,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2427.111,2432.375,"When you say it's protected, does that -- you mean under the -- it qualifies under the first step in Garcetti."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2437.796,2446.275,"Well, if it's not citizen speech under Garcetti, then you don't get to public concern, and then you don't get to Pickering balancing."
2013.13-483,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2446.275,2446.681,Right.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2456.303,2456.74,Correct.
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.365,2471.984,So your -- your position is you cannot speak as a citizen if -- if your speech consists of disclosing material that you knew as an employee.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2474.483,2484.291,"Your Honor, because, as in -- as in Garcetti, where the Court said that when you're speaking pursuant to official job duties--"
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.291,2487.29,"Yes, but this is not an official job duty."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2497.348,2498.239,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.031,2512.421,"No, I'm just--"
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2512.421,2513.546,--the possibility of a--
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.546,2516.67,"--I'm just talking about facts, no opinions, just facts."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2531.616,2537.192,"--That would not be protected speech, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2537.192,2546.766,"But then, I mean, we've said several times things like this: Government employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2557.825,2559.526,"And that is certainly true, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2579.144,2581.987,But in Pickering it was something that anybody could know.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2589.547,2590.313,--Some--
2013.13-483,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2590.313,2592.547,--any citizen could have known that information.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2600.06,2601.23,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2663.8,2664.612,"--Well, let me make sure I understand what you're saying."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2694.802,2698.629,Pickering does not apply.
2013.13-483,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2703.27,2703.321,Neither one.
2013.13-483,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2703.321,2703.7,--Really?
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2723.745,2737.91,"If his letter to the editor merely relayed factual testimony that he possessed only pursuant to his official job duties, that would not be protected speech."
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.374,2759.339,Where -- where -- where did you get this notion that the First Amendment only applies to the expression of views and not to the conveyance of -- of facts?
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2759.339,2760.37,--So we--
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.37,2767.57,All of us can be protected from knowing certain facts and that would not violate the First Amendment?
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2767.57,2769.461,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.954,2784.891,So the government--
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2784.891,2785.688,--protected speech.
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.688,2796.993,"--can presumably prohibit anybody teaching, what, economics, the facts of -- of economics?"
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2796.993,2801.862,"No, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2802.177,2804.024,The facts of World War II.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2804.024,2805.323,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2811.505,2812.714,I don't know where you get it from.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2817.456,2844.056,"--Well, Your Honor, we believe that it's -- it's a long-time precedent of this Court that speech, certainly in the Hustler, Falwell v. Hustler case, where it talked about speech that is close to the heart of the First Amendment, expressing viewpoints, engaging in opinion, public debate, that that is certainly protected speech."
2013.13-483,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2844.056,2847.148,"Well, I thought it was just because the facts came from your employment."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2873.171,2886.006,"Well, Your Honor, we are saying that speech would not be protected if it is merely relaying information that an employee has pursuant to their official duties and when that--"
2013.13-483,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2886.006,2889.052,"And that wouldn't make any difference whether it was fact, opinion, views."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2912.638,2915.682,"--I -- maybe I should clarify, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2935.378,2948.997,"And give me an example of an opinion that would be protected First Amendment speech, as you said, and yet is based on facts you learned only because of your public employment."
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,2948.997,2966.708,"--Your Honor, I would -- I would suggest something close to the Pickering fact situation where a letter to the editor was written that in -- that contained opinion speech, debate speech, critical speech."
2013.13-483,5,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3023.387,3025.336,But if I could just understand what you're saying.
2013.13-483,5,62299,mark_t_waggoner,,3063.061,3072.588,"I think the question there, Your Honor, as the Court articulated in Garcetti, is it -- is it pursuant to your official job duties?"
2013.13-483,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3106.714,3107.761,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-483,6,62297,tejinder_singh,,3112.088,3115.571,Thank you.
2013.13-483,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3179.044,3181.2,So the Eleventh Circuit really got it wrong.
2013.13-483,6,62297,tejinder_singh,,3181.2,3182.075,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2013.13-483,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3182.075,3197.225,"But it's still the precedent that governs in this situation unless you're going to have the employees analyze the law in the other circuits or unless you're going to have the employees look at the Eleventh Circuit opinion and say, I know that's what it says, but it's wrong."
2013.13-483,6,62297,tejinder_singh,,3197.225,3210.437,"Your Honor, I think if Supreme Court precedent is clear, then contrary to Eleventh Circuit precedent shouldn't be controlling and employees shouldn't be entitled to rely on it, and that's certainly the implication of what this Court said in Hope v. Pelzer."
2013.13-483,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3232.352,3239.771,So you're requiring the government employee in this case to be a better analyzer of Supreme Court precedent than the three Eleventh Circuit judges.
2013.13-483,6,62297,tejinder_singh,,3239.771,3256.95,"Your Honor, I think that that is not what we're requiring, because our argument in this case is supplemented by what I think is an equally strong argument that Eleventh Circuit precedent really did not support this outcome, that the Court went very, very far out on a limb in this case."
2013.13-483,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3359.341,3360.06,"Thank you, counsel."
