1988.87-1437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.738,"We'll hear argument now in No. 87-1437, Melvin Blanton v. The City of North Las Vegas."
1988.87-1437,0,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,12.549,13.47,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.87-1437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,72.608,77.441,The Nevada Supreme Court made no point about Fraley having pleaded guilty.
1988.87-1437,0,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,77.441,78.372,"No, sir, they did not."
1988.87-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.522,129.207,"Well, it didn't stand that strictly on it because wasn't the fine... wasn't the possible fine here more than $500?"
1988.87-1437,0,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,129.207,129.895,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,131.637,132.689,"So, it wasn't really all that wooden."
1988.87-1437,0,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,132.689,133.237,--Sir?
1988.87-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.237,134.83,It wasn't all that wooden.
1988.87-1437,0,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,134.83,135.661,"No, sir."
1988.87-1437,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.299,152.361,Selectively wooden.
1988.87-1437,0,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,152.361,155.143,"--It was partially wooden, yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1437,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.819,195.828,Go ahead.
1988.87-1437,0,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,195.828,196.66,Thank you.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1747.557,1762.047,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.404,1808.958,"Why, why, why do you think they have that... wear that distinctive garb with that thing on the back of it?"
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1812.4,1815.092,--I think it's a--
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.092,1822.164,"I mean, you... it wouldn't mean anything to have somebody wear that kind of a thing and it says I sold the unused portion of a railroad... railway ticket."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1827.599,1828.108,--No.
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.12,1832.432,"It's shameful, isn't it?"
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1832.432,1833.093,--deterrence to the others.
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.356,1836.747,It's shameful.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1872.748,1877.452,Is Your Honor's question would that offense still a serious offense in the--
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.452,1877.883,That's right.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1877.883,1878.622,--constitutional context?
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.622,1879.173,Yes.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1879.173,1881.214,"Not under the rulings from this Court, no, it would not."
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.214,1883.447,You think... do you think that's what we'd hope... we'd hold?
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1883.447,1886.298,I believe that's what the Court would hold under the present--
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.298,1890.841,"You would like that result that, that people could be convicted of child molestation without a jury trial."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1893.001,1893.662,--Not particularly.
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.662,1895.595,--that's what the Framers really thought they were doing.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1895.595,1917.006,"Not particularly, but I seriously doubt, although I accept your hypothetical, that a state would make such a serious offense... if I may, by way of analogy to the state statutory scheme in Nevada, we have a misdemeanor annoying a minor offense, and that characteristically is prosecuted where there was no physical harm or no physical touching of the child other than perhaps exterior."
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.628,1944.134,"You would acknowledge that if I don't think that I would hold that way in the case of a child molestation statute that's reduced from five years to six months, then my concern in this case would be more than just the six months."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1947.226,1955.431,"--I, I don't see that that is analogous to this situation when you make it with reference to the distinctive garb."
1988.87-1437,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.974,1957.763,Just arguing about how shameful it is.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,1957.763,1966.04,"Well, clearly it's shameful, but there are many misdemeanors for which a penalty such as provided in Nevada in the DUI law are also shameful."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.066,2026.979,May I interrupt for just a moment because is the quest... the constitutional question I guess is whether this is a criminal prosecution within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2026.979,2028.401,--That's correct.
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.401,2030.522,"That's where the... what, what we're boiled down to."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2035.565,2036.296,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.275,2055.339,"Now, it would be a criminal prosecution within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment if the right to counsel were at stake, wouldn't it?"
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2055.339,2061.321,The Sixth Amendment right to counsel that Your Honor alludes to clearly applies.
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.321,2063.454,To this case.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2063.454,2064.533,"Yes, it does."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.533,2065.514,Because it's a criminal prosecution--
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2065.514,2066.746,No.
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.746,2070.968,--because that's exactly... the Sixth Amendment begins in all criminal prosecutions these different rights obtain.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2070.968,2076.781,"That's true, but more specifically because there's jail time that in fact has to be imposed."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.781,2087.6,"But what you're really saying is that there are some criminal prosecutions that, that... some prosecutions are criminal within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment for one purpose but not for another."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2091.17,2091.691,No.
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.751,2108.742,"Well, but that's not, of course, what the text of the Sixth Amendment says."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2108.742,2109.894,That's true.
1988.87-1437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.894,2123.401,"Perhaps you could refer justice Stevens to the reasoning of the court in the Argersinger case to explain why the word ""criminal prosecution"", at least in the eyes of the court, could be read differently for one purpose than for the other."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2123.401,2134.891,The... there is a parallel... and this is a point I wish to make in my argument... between the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Sixth Amendment jury trial right.
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.905,2221.706,May I ask one other question along justice Scalia's lines?
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2234.606,2236.035,"No, clearly not."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.052,2246.914,What if they asked him to wear it for seven months?
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2246.914,2264.416,"No, because incarceration... that is, the deprivation of liberty... is the essential point to the Six... Sixth Amendment jury trial right, and that does not provide deprivation of liberty, for the same reason the fine amount is not a significant factor in the determination of the jury trial right."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.416,2273.481,"Six... six months and a million dollar fine, which would pretty much pauperize whoever is, is hit with that."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2275.161,2282.047,"Would that even be the case, the court... no court demands a million dollar payment or a hundred dollar payment on the spot at the moment of conviction."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.309,2319.571,I'm not talking about the particulars of Nevada.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2338.134,2341.757,That is the primary or the most relevant criterion--
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.757,2342.085,Why?
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2342.695,2346.629,"--No, because it... the Court has focused on deprivation of liberty."
1988.87-1437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2356.115,2358.165,How about the liberty to wear what kind of shirt you want?
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2358.165,2373.596,"Well, I would submit that that is... it pales in significance to incarceration of the person where they're forced to wear the jail garb and their, their liberty is, is confined to the cell in which they reside at the time of their incarceration."
1988.87-1437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.712,2463.695,Why... why do you say it will be greater than that imposed for the federal courts?
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2463.695,2470.75,"--Because the Petitioners have relied upon not the six-month incarceration rule, but these collateral consequences of the conviction."
1988.87-1437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.708,2504.013,"So, what, what, what you're saying in effect is that if we rule for the Petitioner here, we will, in effect, overrule the Frank case?"
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2504.013,2505.572,"That's correct, and, and the Duncan ruling."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.244,2849.038,May I ask you one other question about the way the statute works?
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2868.472,2869.801,There's no statutory description for it.
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.603,2878.917,"So, if the judge thought that this wasn't distinctive enough, the judge could maybe add a dunce cap and a few other foolish looking things to the uniform?"
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2878.917,2881.919,"Well, as I say, the statute doesn't speak to it, so in theory, yes, it could."
1988.87-1437,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.314,2897.69,"But supposing the judge really took something, the most outrageous... made people work in their underwear with a dunce cap or something crazy, that would still be... that wouldn't trouble you either I suppose."
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2897.69,2901.201,--It may trouble me as a prosecutor and an officer of the court.
1988.87-1437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2904.303,2914.701,Was the defendant... were either of these defendants sentenced to this particular form of... of punishment?
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2914.701,2919.053,Bianton is... is still not in a convicted status.
1988.87-1437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2933.331,2941.158,"Well, has the Supreme Court of Nevada ever approved the sentencing of someone to do their two days' community work in this kind of an outfit?"
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2941.158,2943.189,"No, it hasn't addressed the issue."
1988.87-1437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2943.189,2945.099,And the statute says nothing about it.
1988.87-1437,1,36977,mark_l_zalaoras,,2945.099,2946.31,That's correct.
1988.87-1437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3059.365,3062.958,"Thank you, Mr. Zalaoras."
1988.87-1437,2,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,3066.278,3067.77,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.87-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3068.221,3069.53,You'll have to be.
1988.87-1437,2,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,3069.53,3070.331,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3091.196,3093.566,"Could you speak up a little bit, Mr. Graves?"
1988.87-1437,2,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,3093.566,3094.117,"--I'm sorry, sir."
1988.87-1437,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3135.003,3137.665,Do you want us to change Baldwin?
1988.87-1437,2,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,3137.665,3138.737,"--No, sir."
1988.87-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3165.806,3170.838,"Yet, you can use... lose your driver's license by just driving with a... an expired license."
1988.87-1437,2,30422,john_j_graves_jr,,3172.869,3174.08,"No, sir, that's true."
1988.87-1437,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.555,3185.098,"Thank you, Mr. Graves."
