2012.12-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.718,"We'll hear argument next in Case 12-246, Salinas v. Texas."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,6.737,9.456,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-246,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,85.387,88.974,Why isn't it -- why isn't it like the Berg -- is it Berghuis case?
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,105.567,108.935,"--No, that's not the holding of the Berghuis case, with all due respect."
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,127.849,129.033,Then what's the law?
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,143.625,145.31,--If the--
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,145.31,156.333,"I mean, isn't it -- you're not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell the government anything, and later on it turns out to be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken as an invocation of the Fifth Amendment."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,157.485,158.385,"--No, I don't need to."
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,158.385,159.102,Okay.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,159.904,160.42,This case is--
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,160.42,161.554,Then what is -- then you need a line.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,187.887,202.831,"--Well, it's sufficient to decide this case to say that a noncustodial police interview during the investigation of a crime where they're interviewing somebody about -- who is -- who is, as the State concedes, a suspect in a crime."
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.151,223.811,"Well, but it's -- it's well settled that when you're -- wherein you're examining the witness and he takes -- and he suddenly says I don't want any more questions, that that's -- he's waived if you're in court, if you're examining a witness on the stand."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,239.989,243.224,"I think that would be admissible, but it would be forbidden for the--"
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,243.224,244.258,"Because he said, “ Well ”?"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,244.258,244.924,--Yes.
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.543,250.728,But -- but could the police officer also testify that and then he started to cry?
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,250.728,252.264,--Perhaps.
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.418,262.603,"Or the prosecution could say, Well, he said, well, and started to cry, and he never told us anything else."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,266.673,268.289,I think that may well cross the line.
2012.12-246,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,312.904,333.032,"Mr. Fisher, but then -- do -- do I understand correctly that you're saying demeanor is different, so, although it was impermissible to comment on silence, it was okay to say he looked down, he seemed to be sweating, he was very nervous, he was shuffling his feet."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,333.032,347.641,"Insofar as demeanor evidence that the State offers has communicative values and the State argues that it has communicative value, independent of simply what the defendant looked like when he remains silent, then it -- then it may well be able to introduce that evidence."
2012.12-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,381.882,385.767,"Mr. Fisher, my -- I have a number of problems."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,416.12,416.722,--No.
2012.12-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,416.722,424.209,Or are you trying to equate the rights that a defendant has to custodial and noncustodial with respect to invocation?
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,424.209,424.676,No.
2012.12-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,447.591,461.584,"The problem -- I have an easier problem understanding this argument with respect -- and I'm going to ask your adversaries -- with respect to the situation in which someone is approached by the police and said, come in and talk to us."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,505.78,511.349,"If I may, let me focus on the Berghuis question and then turn to the selective silence point."
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.084,545.905,"I don't want -- are you saying that before the Miranda warning is required, you cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment?"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,545.905,547.273,No.
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,547.94,550.391,I mean -- that's my -- that's how I understood that.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,551.408,554.26,Let me separate two rights.
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.494,582.696,"--Well, but it can be invoked, and that might make a big difference."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,587.148,587.6,--Right.
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,588.467,595.587,"And so if there's -- if questions are somehow troublesome, you say, I'm invoking my Fifth Amendment right; go away, even if you're not in custody, even if Miranda doesn't apply."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,595.587,596.037,--Right.
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,596.037,597.222,And your client didn't do that here.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,597.222,597.939,He didn't.
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,695.136,702.29,"Well, yes, there's no doubt he was remaining silent, but the issue is whether he was trying to raise his Fifth Amendment right."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,724.988,725.522,Yes.
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.994,734.594,Depends on the circumstance.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,734.594,742.767,--in a setting in which -- in a setting in which the Government has every good reason to know that the person is most likely to be relying on the Fifth Amendment.
2012.12-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,777.923,788.415,"How would you deal with another comment situation where a defendant meets up with the police, gives a story, and then later changes the story."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,814.213,816.732,"--No, Justice Sotomayor, for two reasons."
2012.12-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,823.102,825.421,Though sometimes they come back and later do a different confession.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,825.421,825.988,--Right.
2012.12-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,877.472,879.188,He's not in custody.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,890.196,894.148,--I think you'd have to ask that to the Solicitor General.
2012.12-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,903.004,903.873,"Well, is that something--"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,903.873,904.806,--but you can imagine many more.
2012.12-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,904.806,907.158,--Is that something that could be used against him at trial?
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,907.158,910.694,It can be introduced.
2012.12-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,916.38,921.417,"Well, it's probative if that he says that -- he's answering all the questions, they're fine, all of a sudden they say, well, is your shotgun going to match the shell?"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,921.417,921.884,Yeah.
2012.12-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.884,922.684,"Then he goes, gosh, it's late."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,924.053,925.153,Well--
2012.12-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,925.153,926.905,--That seems as probative as the silence.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,926.905,936.344,"--Well -- and so -- what the State cannot do is what it did in this case, and sort of transform that into he refused to answer and therefore it shows he's guilty."
2012.12-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1012.159,1019.498,But you draw a distinction between Mr. Salinas's situation and someone who's questioned in the home -- in the person's home or on the street?
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1019.498,1036.127,"--No, I don't think there is a relevant distinction there, Justice Alito, as long as an investigatory interview -- and this Court has said time and again, whether it's Berkemer in a traffic stop or plenty -- or Royer, that the police can try to initiate consensual encounters."
2012.12-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1042.813,1052.969,"And what if -- what if the person -- what if the person was totally unknown to the police, but called up the police and said they want -- and wants to talk to them for some purpose."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1056.254,1060.242,"--In -- well, if he wants to talk to them--"
2012.12-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1060.242,1061.492,He wants to talk to them and--
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1061.492,1064.444,"--I'm not sure he has the right to remain silent, no."
2012.12-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1064.444,1067.729,"--He wants to talk to them, and then in the course of this conversation, the same thing happens that happened here."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1067.729,1074.05,"I think that might, depending on the precision of the hypothetical, be a little bit of a difficult -- different case."
2012.12-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.107,1089.159,"You're -- you're giving us Miranda, not Miranda, custody, not custody, gray area."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1093.629,1095.998,"No, I don't want a gray area opinion."
2012.12-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1130.838,1148.883,"I -- I'm assuming, now that I'm thinking about your argument, you would argue that even in a custodial setting a prosecutor couldn't say, I asked him did he shoot his wife, and the prosecutor can't argue that because he refused to answer that makes him guilty."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1148.883,1159.238,"--That's precisely what the Court said already in Footnote 37 in Miranda, what the lower courts have depended on for a generation now, and I don't think my opponents are even arguing to the contrary."
2012.12-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1159.238,1168.711,"Well, in fact, at most trials, district court judges tell juries the evidence is not the unanswered question, it's the question plus the answer."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1168.711,1168.994,Right.
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1187.091,1187.475,Yes.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1202.684,1203.184,"No, but -- but--"
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.184,1213.206,"You're not in an inherently coercive setting as you are in the Miranda situation, you're not at trial, and outside those two situations, you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth Amendment--"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1213.206,1213.575,--No.
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1213.575,1216.325,--or tap on the Constitution or something in order to indicate--
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1216.325,1216.86,No.
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1216.86,1217.894,--that's what's at issue and that's what--
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1217.894,1219.144,"Justice Breyer, this is crucial."
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1219.144,1219.877,--Yes.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1219.877,1228.683,"If Mr. Salinas had been in a -- if everything about the case was identical, but he'd been in custody, there would be no argument that his silence could be used against him."
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1228.683,1229.066,Right.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1233.737,1245.461,"But it's not because of the physical or inherent pressures of custody, because what the Court has said time and again is that after somebody receives their Miranda warnings, they have a free and deliberate choice whether to talk."
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1245.461,1247.579,"--Well, I don't want to make the Government's argument for them."
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1248.846,1261.487,"Well, no, but I do want -- I do want to make sure that the Court understands the critical difference between the express invocation requirement that this Court established in Berghuis and what I'm asking for today."
2012.12-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1310.237,1355.783,"So I think the argument will be, I think, at least in my mind, that if after sitting there for 45 minutes -- or maybe it was an hour and 45 minutes -- without saying anything, I'm -- I'm maybe taking a dissenting position, but if when the answer doesn't answer over that long period of time, but doesn't say, I want to remain silent, if that long period of behavior is insufficient without the express statement to show that he wanted to remain silent, so outside custodial setting, should it be insufficient to simply remain silent to show that -- you see, it's argument by analogy, I think--"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1355.783,1361.936,"I understand, but his silence wasn't able to be used against him in Berghuis; his state -- his later statements were."
2012.12-246,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1364.621,1366.156,"Isn't the -- isn't the point, Mr. Fisher--"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1366.156,1366.773,--Pardon?
2012.12-246,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1366.773,1368.942,--The question is: What is it insufficient for?
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1373.394,1373.71,Exactly.
2012.12-246,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1373.71,1375.446,That's not the case here.
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1383.868,1384.618,Precisely.
2012.12-246,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1384.618,1386.154,"That's an entirely different question, isn't it?"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1386.154,1387.837,That's exactly my point.
2012.12-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1445.358,1463.07,"Unless you're going to argue that -- that silence cannot be -- can never be commented on in any noncustodial situation, and I didn't think you were willing to go that far when I was questioning you previously, you're going to have the same kind of line-drawing questions; aren't you?"
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1463.07,1463.704,--No.
2012.12-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1463.704,1464.97,Where was it held?
2012.12-246,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1473.693,1482.632,"So as to where you draw the line, if I understand your question, as to where an express invocation before trial would be required, you are going to have to draw a line."
2012.12-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1523.108,1525.31,"I guess, as I understand your rule -- I'm sorry."
2012.12-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1527.177,1527.846,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1533.314,1537.885,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1548.974,1550.176,"But why, counsel?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1557.83,1559.448,--Well--
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1559.448,1562.334,It -- no problem.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1585.414,1587.865,"--Yeah, I don't know that that would be sufficient to convict him."
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1596.471,1602.458,It's a little scary to me that an unanswered question is evidence of guilt.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1602.458,1603.125,--Well--
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1603.125,1608.779,He is not arguing that the physical response is not admissible.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1619.652,1629.109,"--I think one of the things we are asking the Court to do, Justice Sotomayor, is to recognize that silence, certainly as occurred in this case, doesn't always occur in a vacuum."
2012.12-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.917,1643.369,"Well, it would be up to the jury, wouldn't it?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1649.773,1650.256,Right.
2012.12-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.256,1653.991,The question is whether you can ask the jury to consider that.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1653.991,1654.458,Correct.
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1664.033,1675.554,"Your -- my hypothetical that I posed earlier, if the police call you and say come in for questioning and you ignore them, is that an invocation of the right to silence or not?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1675.554,1678.44,"--I don't know that that's an invocation, Your Honor, but I don't know--"
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1678.44,1682.744,Why could you argue that that's--
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1682.744,1694.635,"--Number one, I don't think a prosecutor ever would argue that because that's ambiguous and not probative, and I think -- not probative for someone just to not come in when police offer them a chance to come in."
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1694.635,1698.504,--They -- they're arguing what the legal theory of guilt is in that situation.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1698.504,1699.037,Right.
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1721.702,1722.252,All right.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1753.923,1755.106,"--I don't believe he has, Your Honor."
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1760.827,1769.7,So a prosecutor could go into the jury and say he waived his Miranda rights and he is guilty because he refused to answer our questions?
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1769.7,1776.004,"--He is guilty if he revealed a guilty conscience, Your Honor."
2012.12-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.004,1776.706,He wouldn't say that.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1788.097,1788.88,"Correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1809.593,1810.827,I'm sorry.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1816.247,1817.481,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1817.481,1822.401,"Are you now adopting the Solicitor General's argument, because your brief goes further?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1826.555,1828.639,"I believe that has been our position, Your Honor."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1846.3,1852.604,"And so you would agree with the Government that if he had invoked, that the Fifth Amendment right would come into play."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1852.604,1857.241,"We would not attempt to just -- we would not attempt to introduce anything, for example “ I plead the Fifth ”,"
2012.12-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.597,1873.084,"That's the line you're drawing, between his just not answering and his saying, I don't want to answer?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1873.084,1876.119,"--Correct, if I understand your question."
2012.12-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.119,1879.523,"But the latter can't be introduce to the jury, but the former can."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1879.523,1881.106,Correct.
2012.12-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.173,1884.825,Why would you -- why would you draw that -- that line?
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1884.825,1894.866,"--I think, Your Honor, I would not want to -- I would not want to introduce a statement that a defendant was relying on a constitutional right by saying,"
2012.12-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.37,1903.722,Doesn't the mere silence suggest
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1905.139,1906.341,It might.
2012.12-246,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1921.116,1923.566,"Particularly since he did want to talk some more, right?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1923.566,1924.385,Correct.
2012.12-246,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1934.241,1944.966,"But isn't the most logical inference from the silence not that he isn't quick enough to come up with an exculpatory answer, but that it would incriminate him if he answered?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,1944.966,1947.584,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-246,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1961.325,1968.581,But he could -- he could invoke the Fifth Amendment with respect to one set of questions and not another.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2003.837,2014.526,"Your Honor, I think that would be consistent with this Court's jurisprudence to -- to allow the use of evidence if there was no invocation involved."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2060.007,2083.789,"But, Mr. Curry, in a case like Berghuis, which is in a custodial setting, if the defendant there had not ever said anything, had gone through the entire interview and really never said a word, so that the police kept asking him questions, but he never said anything, the prosecutors could then not go in and say, look, for 3 hours, we asked him questions and he didn't talk."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2099.716,2103.584,"Well, number one, because the hypotheticals are different."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2110.024,2110.34,Yes.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2128.818,2129.968,Okay.
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2139.959,2142.328,"He -- he didn't invoke, he just didn't answer."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2142.328,2147.363,"--But it could be a suggestion where he was attempting to exercise the -- the right, because he never answered anything."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2156.469,2157.087,Okay.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2159.304,2163.574,"That's one of the reasons, Your Honor."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2163.574,2167.276,"On this -- on this, you know, you can't pick and choose kind of argument."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2167.276,2173.263,"Well, we're saying that you cannot infer an assertion of a Fifth Amendment right based upon this."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2181.75,2193.157,"So would it be fair to say that your argument is, look, you can't just like keep talking and talking and talking and -- and at that point, you have to invoke?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2206.151,2206.684,--No.
2012.12-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.279,2228.565,But I thought you said he didn't have to do that if he didn't answer any questions.
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2231.166,2232.551,You took the words out of my mouth.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2232.551,2233.134,--No.
2012.12-246,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2240.888,2244.442,"Well, but in Berghuis, we found no implication."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2244.442,2245.559,--Correct.
2012.12-246,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2246.242,2249.561,So -- so Justice Kagan's question stands.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2249.561,2255.834,"But -- but the defendant in Berghuis did answer some questions, Your Honor, and that's what makes it different from Berghuis."
2012.12-246,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2259.619,2261.236,"Well, a few, as I recall."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2261.236,2261.619,--Correct.
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2262.104,2264.104,"Mr. Curry, Berghuis is different for a different reason."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2281.599,2288.638,"--Well, it is a different question, but here, I think the police were, quote-unquote, “ going away ”."
2012.12-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2291.59,2293.057,Exactly.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2303.231,2307.017,But this Court's case law still requires an invocation.
2012.12-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.17,2313.853,What is that?
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2374.077,2376.661,"--No, the Government is also arguing as well, Your Honor."
2012.12-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.661,2378.713,"Well, that's -- I'd like to get the same answer."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2378.713,2379.729,Yes.
2012.12-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.729,2390.021,"Because I -- well, now they cite for the proposition, I think, that it -- that the prosecutor is forbidden to make that comment, note 37 of Miranda."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2391.705,2393.405,Correct.
2012.12-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2393.405,2394.907,And I -- may be ambiguous on the point.
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2397.942,2398.576,Right.
2012.12-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2400.426,2402.511,"No, fine."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2412.452,2418.956,"--Your Honor, I do not believe that this Court has extended Griffin to this particular type of fact situation, and Griffin wouldn't apply to that."
2012.12-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.956,2423.475,"Is there any authority, or is it just your opinion that we have to go on?"
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2423.475,2427.046,"Well, I believe this Court would have had the opportunity to extend Griffin."
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2561.998,2565.084,Where does the compulsion line come in?
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2590.502,2600.273,"--I could perceive then, Your Honor, the -- the trial court upholding a claim by the defendant that he was coerced at that point, that at that point, the officer--"
2012.12-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2600.273,2611.398,"So why can't you say that a call from a police officer to someone who says come in and talk, that that can't be used against them at trial as -- you gave me a different answer."
2012.12-246,1,15730,alan_k_curry,,2615.283,2616.385,--No.
2012.12-246,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2737.895,2739.347,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2750.286,2753.072,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2787.495,2793.149,"That is such a radical position, that silence is an admission of guilty."
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2833.457,2847.949,"--Well, I think the Court has repeatedly recognized that when a citizen is voluntarily interacting with the police and there -- there is no coercion because it's not a custodial situation, we expect that person to be treated as fully capable of deciding whether or not to assert his rights."
2012.12-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2877.819,2878.671,Ms. Anders?
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2878.671,2880.455,And so when the person does not do that--
2012.12-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2880.455,2880.957,I'm sorry.
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2915.611,2923.949,"--Well, I think the reason that we don't require invocation in the Miranda setting, I think highlights the fundamental difference between custodial interrogation and noncustodial interrogation."
2012.12-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2930.603,2931.389,"Yes, because then when--"
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2931.389,2932.005,--and therefore--
2012.12-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2932.005,2933.122,"--you're given the warnings, and then that's gone."
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,2933.122,2933.839,--Exactly.
2012.12-246,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2958.207,2988.742,"You've -- you've said in your brief that there might be a whole other -- many other reasons for remaining silent, and I -- I suggested that the -- in -- in this kind of scenario, the most likely reason that the suspect will clam up is that he fears incrimination."
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3011.174,3012.341,--That's right.
2012.12-246,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3055.87,3058.155,So are you -- are you conceding the -- the point that they make?
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3072.313,3073.415,I think that raises a--
2012.12-246,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3073.415,3078.117,Does it?
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3078.986,3085.556,"--Well, there is -- there is a circuit split on that, and -- and I think the circuit split shows that it raises a different analytical question that the Court doesn't have to get into here."
2012.12-246,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3101.749,3102.684,And do you have a view on it?
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3102.684,3108.588,"--I -- I think we think that the better view is that Doyle probably does not apply, but I think there is a serious question there."
2012.12-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3118.194,3128.832,"Well, what is your answer to Justice Kagan's earlier question to the hypothetical of the defendant that says nothing for 20 questions?"
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3128.832,3130.168,"--Well, I -- I think the standard--"
2012.12-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3130.168,3132.37,Then there's no -- and there's no Miranda warning and no custody.
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3132.37,3132.97,--Right.
2012.12-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3148.713,3149.23,What -- what does that mean?
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3152.7,3157.569,"I think if he expresses the desire not to answer the question, that is sufficient because he is saying,"
2012.12-246,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3170.661,3171.161,Okay.
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3186.188,3186.605,Absolutely.
2012.12-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3259.951,3265.771,"Well, Ms. Anders, suppose, you know, he thinks that the interview is going to be one thing and then it turns out that the interview was something else."
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3283.633,3287.268,"I think that would be sufficient, yes, to say, I don't want to answer any more questions."
2012.12-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3288.054,3292.839,"Or if he says, I don't want to answer questions about a particular topic; is that an invocation?"
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3292.839,3297.41,--I think that would be sufficient to invoke with respect to questions on that topic.
2012.12-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3303.33,3304.58,That doesn't sound like a clear rule.
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3320.023,3327.845,"--Well, I think it's -- it's an objective standard and it's the same formulation that the Court has already adopted in Berghuis and in Thompkins and in Davis."
2012.12-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3344.974,3354.346,What's not administrable about telling the police you just can't argue to a jury that merely not asking a question is guilt?
2012.12-246,2,24910,ginger_d_anders,,3358.816,3365.304,"--Well, I -- I think there are a variety of circumstances in which, as I said before, silence is probative of guilt."
2012.12-246,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3372.641,3373.66,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-246,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3375.826,3380.064,Thank you.
2012.12-246,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3620.886,3635.945,"I'll like to go back to what Justice Ginsburg argued, because there is an argument here that there wasn't an invocation of the right, that by physical conduct, there was a statement."
2012.12-246,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3648.605,3649.989,"No, that would be--"
2012.12-246,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3649.989,3651.641,And that shows his guilt.
2012.12-246,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3651.641,3652.974,--That would be an entirely different case.
2012.12-246,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3663.799,3664.749,"Thank you, counsel."
