1978.77-1115,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.031,We'll hear arguments next in Lalli against Lalli.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,49.648,54.552,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.236,211.221,How old was the --
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,211.221,211.9,I beg your pardon?
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.9,215.718,How old was at the time of his father's death?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,215.718,220.077,I think he was about 26 or 28.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,220.077,221.39,Much older than two years old.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,221.39,224.656,"Much order than two years old, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,289.77,294.441,In full?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,294.441,307.837,"Originally in full but shortly before he died, the son having reached the age of majority was working for the father in his business, so the father supported him in part."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,307.837,313.884,"So, it's you position that he supported him entirely as long as he was a minor?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,313.884,315.557,That's correct.
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,315.557,322.338,Under New York Law could the decedent have taken care of this child by will?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,322.338,323.42,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,323.42,324.716,He did not do so?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,324.716,327.388,He did not do so because he was killed.
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,328.525,330.728,"No, almost die --"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,330.728,332.143,He was killed.
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,332.143,333.565,I say all of us die.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,333.565,335.093,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,335.093,337.962,Did he have will?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,341.462,337.962,We don't know.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.682,344.496,How was he killed?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,345.269,346.798,He was -- no.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,351.564,352.892,Also name Lalli?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,352.892,353.877,Also named Lalli.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,353.877,355.62,Everybody in this case is named Lalli.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,355.62,357.749,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,357.749,360.835,And was that Aileen's son by another man?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,360.835,365.781,That was Aileen's son by another man.
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,365.781,371.109,Is Robert's formal birth certificate in the record?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,371.109,372.416,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,372.416,374.057,Is there a reason why it wasn't?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,374.057,380.707,There is no -- apparently there is no birth certificate that we know of about Robert.
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,399.097,402.909,Getting back a minute to -- was it born in New York?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,402.909,404.143,He was born in New York.
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,404.533,407.033,And you can't find a birth certificate in New York?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,407.033,412.376,We don't know of any birth certificate for Robert Lalli.
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,412.376,415.721,"Well, obviously he had a birth certificate, if he was born in New York."
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,415.721,417.593,He may have a birth certificate.
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.615,422.104,Did anybody look for one?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,422.104,431.701,"We have not looked for one, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,431.701,434.029,He was born?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,434.029,434.591,I beg your pardon?
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,434.591,435.624,He was born?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,435.624,436.374,He was born.
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,445.528,452.875,"Mr. Henkin, I think in your brief, you don't site Labine against Vincent?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,452.875,453.969,"No, we do not."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,453.969,456.166,"On the ground what, that its --"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,456.166,463.978,We feel that that case is not applicable to this situation in view of Gordon versus Trimble.
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,502.456,506.992,Then you think that the Trimble against Gordon really overruled Vincent against Labine?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,506.992,508.775,"To that extent, yes."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,508.775,510.948,"Although, it didn't say so on so many words."
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,510.948,515.15,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,518.212,520.76,Can I ask you one more question and I'll stop.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,528.604,529.028,No.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.247,555.073,Is that the main asset of the estate?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,555.073,559.739,"Yes, it is the stepson, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,559.739,560.485,"Yes, I understand."
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,563.409,564.581,What the assets of the --
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,564.581,566.405,Yes.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,568.295,570.331,"$100,000.00"
1978.77-1115,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,570.331,572.98,"$100,000.00 property."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,572.98,575.398,Of tangible assets plus this tort claim?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,575.398,576.669,This --
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.669,578.048,Plus this tort claim?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,578.048,583.836,That is correct.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,583.836,592.091,Thanks.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,592.091,605.35,"Now, against this claim there was an acknowledgment in any ground which --"
1978.77-1115,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.125,629.194,Is the microphone functioning?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,749.327,757.849,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.849,759.505,"Mr. Henkin, before you start."
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,771.477,774.994,She did not appeal in this Court.
1978.77-1115,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,789.639,791.758,"The case had been settled or anything like that, has it?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,791.758,792.008,No.
1978.77-1115,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.108,808.514,Would you tell me one other thing.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,822.544,829.057,"Ah, there is -- we claim that there is over a $100,000.00 involved in this estate."
1978.77-1115,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.057,829.729,I see.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,829.729,842.323,We also claim that there is death cause of action which he did not follow up and as to which we say we are entitled to an accounting.
1978.77-1115,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.323,842.651,I see.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,844.369,852.348,"Yes, there is a substantial amount of money involve in this case."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,876.214,895.743,"Mr. Henkin, if your client had been illegitimate son, let's say, a father and mother married had one child, under the laws of the intent of succession in New York upon the father's death, does what the mother gets two-thirds and the child one-third?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,895.743,898.297,"No, if he was the only child --"
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,898.297,898.408,Yes.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,898.408,901.71,"He would get one-third, I mean, one-half."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,901.71,902.41,One-half.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,902.41,905.046,But if there were more than one child --
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,905.046,906.767,All of them together will get money?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,906.767,917.566,If there were two children then they will get two-thirds and the mother gets one-third but the mother was -- the mother of this child was dead.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,923.892,925.791,"No, widow of the deceased."
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,925.791,927.479,Of the decedent.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,927.479,928.276,And under --
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,928.276,932.423,She was appointed administrator as his window.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,932.423,938.032,"I see and in that situation, if this had been a legitimate child under the laws of New York, how would the --"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,938.032,938.492,He was --
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,938.492,940.336,-- decedent's estates had been shared?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,940.336,946.882,One-third to her and two-thirds to the two children.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.882,948.256,There is another child?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,948.256,949.35,There is another child.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.35,950.585,A legitimate child?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,950.585,952.585,"No, illegitimate child also."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.585,953.367,I see.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,953.367,960.752,But the one that I represent and the one who made an application and who is the appellant is one of the two children.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,960.752,963.252,"I see, one of the two illegitimate children?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,963.252,969.424,Right.
1978.77-1115,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1154.83,1162.721,Your client could have been -- had all the protection you now seek without his parents being married.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1170.488,1174.567,"He could not do it, if Your Honor pleases."
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1235.096,1243.678,Mr. Henkin you said a moment ago that your -- the father and mother here complied with the New York law and did not marry.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1245.366,1257.619,"Yes, because the father had a wife living at the time, who was the widow, the respondent in this case who does not appear on this appeal."
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.619,1260.272,"So, he would have been guilty of bigamy had a married --"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1260.272,1303.364,"That is correct, but the statute Section 24 of the Domestic Relation's Law specifically says, “That regardless of the validity of the marriage, even if the marriage is not valid, even the marriage is absolutely no good, from its inception, any child born before or after is a legitimate child of those people who went through a marriage ceremony if they are the parents of that child, without any proof or whatsoever being required of compliance with an order of affiliation or any other requirements."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1368.409,1370.754,But if he still draw will?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1370.754,1387.036,"Yes, Your Honor, but in Gordon versus Trimble, this Court said that they will does not have to be drawn and that that fact that no will has been drawn has no constitutional significance as to the right of the child."
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.036,1395.467,"Your client also challenged the two-year provision of the New York affiliation law, did it not in the separate attack?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1395.467,1401.155,We raised that question in both of our appeals.
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.592,1435.498,Except you could have challenged the statute on that ground that you did challenge then but wasn't passed on?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1435.498,1454.874,"But we are challenging the statute on the ground of Gordon versus Trimble and also because Section 24 of the decedent estate law created two classes of illegitimates without any distinction between them, except the fact of marriage."
1978.77-1115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.054,1470.692,Well in Trimble wasn't there or hadn't there been a judicial determination --
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1470.692,1471.727,In Trimble --
1978.77-1115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.727,1473.504,-- prior to the death of the father?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1473.504,1475.661,There was a judicial determination.
1978.77-1115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.661,1478.317,Not here?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1478.317,1480.226,"In this case, there wasn't."
1978.77-1115,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.289,1500.791,But the fact is if there was a judicial determination in Trimble?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1500.791,1502.839,"Yes, that is correct."
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1611.915,1615.297,What's mother's -- what's the widow's position in all this --
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1615.297,1616.447,They were originally she opposed the application.
1978.77-1115,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1616.447,1620.084,"She's taken the position that this is not his child, is that not correct?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1620.084,1621.038,I beg your pardon?

1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1627.787,1653.329,"That was her original position but she admitted on the first appeal to the Court of Appeals that the issue involved was as to whether or not a child could participate by raising, that was the point that they making their first appeal, when we first won before this Court."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.329,1658.456,"Mr. Henkin, I want to be sure I didn't misunderstand you."
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1676.103,1681.702,"That is correct, Your Honor, because Section 522 --"
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1681.702,1682.077,Yes.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1682.077,1698.077,"-- of the Family Court Act was amended to permit such an application to be made by laws of 1976, Chapter 665, taking effect as of January 1, 1977."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1698.077,1701.498,So that during his lifetime he could not have --
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1701.498,1701.734,Make such an application.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1701.734,1703.593,-- have a secured an order affiliation?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1703.593,1718.728,"And if he made such an application during his lifetime under the matter of Ricky M. versus Sharon R, 49 Appellant Division, 2nd 1035 such application would have been denied."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1718.728,1721.212,And is that in your -- is that case in your brief?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1721.212,1722.79,"No, it is not, if Your Honor please."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.79,1724.962,Could you give me that citation again.

1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.949,1734.041,49?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1734.041,1738.928,49 Appellant Division 2nd --
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.928,1739.186,Right.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1739.186,1743.22,"1035, 1975 Case."
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1743.22,1743.664,And why was he denied?
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.664,1746.273,"Mr. Henkin, you --"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1746.273,1747.069,I beg your pardon?
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1747.069,1748.96,Why was he denied?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1748.96,1755.772,Because there was not provision in the statute at that time for the father to make such application.
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1759.8,1766.735,"You mean, up until 1976 in New York, it must have been the last thing?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1766.735,1771.244,"In this man, he was killed in 1974, if Your Honor pleases."
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1771.244,1782.861,"What I mean in, if New York didn't get around to letting children inherent from their father when 1976, wouldn't that make on to the last date to do it?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1782.861,1787.676,They -- you're talking with reference to the children born before that time?
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1787.676,1788.566,Yes.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1788.566,1792.194,"That's why were here, claiming that the statute is unconstitutional."
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.194,1794.526,"But the child or mother can apply, can't they?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1794.526,1796.088,"Yes, the mother could apply --"
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.088,1796.101,So --
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1796.101,1800.522,But the mother wouldn't -- didn't apply because they were living together as one family.
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.522,1800.891,"Well, so --"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1800.891,1802.098,That's the reason for it.
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.098,1805.916,Your statement is really a very technical one that the father couldn't apply.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1808.918,1819.229,"If the mother applied, if the father who did support her, and also, she had to apply only within two years after the birth of the child."
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.51,1865.17,"So, the New York Court of Appeals and its opinion at A-2 in this case says that, “Under our New York statute, the right to inherit depends only on proof that Court of competent jurisdiction is made in order affiliation declaring paternity during the lifetime of the father.”"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1865.457,1867.442,That is not correct because the necessity was not provided.
1978.77-1115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.442,1874.254,"Well, we're certainly not going -- well we're not going to second guess, let say of, New York Court of Appeals on what New York law is?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1874.254,1886.929,"Well, if Your Honor please, that the statute is printed in the record and it's in my brief and it's the language of that statute is very clear."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1886.929,1890.328,Has to be made during the pregnancy of the mother or within two from the birth of a child?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1890.328,1890.967,Right.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1891.966,1893.435,That's what the statute says?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1893.435,1895.359,That's exactly what the statute says.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1895.359,1895.557,But the --
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1895.557,1902.526,"So, when they made that statement, they're not quoting the exact language of the statute."
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1907.072,1910.29,You mean the Court of Appeals doesn't have to advance sheets?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1910.29,1910.961,Beg your pardon?
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1910.961,1916.144,You mean the Court of Appeal doesn't have the advanced sheets?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1916.144,1937.069,"The advanced -- the decision of the Court of Appeals -- the opinion of the Court of Appeals, if Your Honor pleases, are printed, the first one in Appendix A, in the jurisdictional statement 75-1148."
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1937.069,1937.71,Right.
1978.77-1115,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1937.71,1938.523,Right.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1938.523,1954.051,"Now, you do say that order affiliation could've been secured under New York law at the behest of -- somebody other than the natural father during the natural father's lifetime?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1954.051,1954.47,Yes.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1956.095,1959.717,"That is by the mother, the natural mother?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1959.717,1961.976,Natural mother could've made the application.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1961.976,1964.068,"Or anybody else, the child?"
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1964.068,1966.302,So far as -- the child yes.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1973.412,1981.021,And the -- but you say that as a matter of practical fact the natural mother wouldn't have done it and why was that?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1981.021,1989.583,The natural mother would not have done it because she was living together with the father and he was supporting her and the children.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1989.583,1995.296,Was that -- was she the -- his sister-in-law?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1995.296,1995.983,No.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.983,1996.467,What was she?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,1998.17,2001.969,Her name was Lalli because she was living with Mr. Lalli.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2001.969,2002.64,Yes.
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,2002.64,2005.921,That was her name by courtesy.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.366,2030.118,And where was Mrs. Lalli all this time?
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,2030.118,2035.861,She was living in another house.
1978.77-1115,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2035.861,2037.359,He had to know.
1978.77-1115,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2042.215,2043.958,"I think your time is expired now, Mr. Henkin."
1978.77-1115,0,34614,leonard_m_henkin,,2043.958,2044.695,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2044.695,2051.967,Mr. Strum.
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2051.967,2056.232,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1978.77-1115,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2099.8,2102.04,"The Court of Appeals has never read it out of the statute, do they?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2102.04,2102.344,No.
1978.77-1115,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.382,2105.93,"In this case, they just ignored it?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2105.93,2106.649,Yes.
1978.77-1115,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2198.94,2211.962,"Is it reasonable to assume that the two-year limit was placed by the legislature or probably placed there by the legislature, so that the facts could be ascertained while there were people around who could test the fact?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2211.962,2214.978,"Yes, I would assume that was the purpose behind it."
1978.77-1115,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2238.194,2258.429,"Does the acquiesce of the Court of Appeals or the apparent acquiesce of the Court of Appeals in this interpretation by its constituent courts, mean the same thing or should it mean the same thing to us as a holding of the highest court of the state construing the statute?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2258.429,2263.772,"Well, I would not classify it as a holding and I would not go so far."
1978.77-1115,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.969,2265.562,"Well, but should it be equated?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2265.562,2274.405,"I think for the purposes of this argument and for the purposes of the constitutionality of the New York, yes, I think it can be equated."
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2274.405,2276.545,But in any event there was no order of affiliation until it's any --
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2276.545,2278.657,In this case there was none whatsoever and that --
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2278.657,2279.65,During the lifetime of the father?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2279.65,2281.525,"No, and there was no attempt to get one."
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2281.525,2282.15,Or ever?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2282.15,2282.931,Yes.
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2289.658,2291.22,"1976, we were told."
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2291.22,2291.884,No.
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.928,2312.298,It is 4-1.2 went into effect in 1967?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2312.298,2313.676,"Yes, that's correct."
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2313.676,2313.908,Yes.
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2313.908,2315.544,That is the statute now before this Court.
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2315.544,2316.154,"Yes, I know."
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2316.154,2317.021,No other statute.
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2317.021,2317.85,We would --
1978.77-1115,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.85,2323.881,"Or if he sought counsel, counsel might have advised him that since the two-year period had expired, it was no use?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2323.881,2326.991,"Well, there's no showing that he attempted to seek counsel."
1978.77-1115,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.662,2373.09,"Well, under that if you're talking about the statutory scheme, I suppose under the statute, if there was a Court order prior to the death of the father, obtained on the petition of either the son or mother it would be -- it would satisfy the statute whether or not the father was around, could be found, or participated in the hearing?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2373.09,2374.133,"I would assume so, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.133,2378.036,They could go to Court and say the father had disappeared and still --
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2378.036,2380.186,"Well, he could've been served by publication."
1978.77-1115,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.186,2380.748,Alright.
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2382.482,2383.414,No.
1978.77-1115,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.414,2385.817,He didn't need to be available to give evidence or anything?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2385.817,2386.644,No.
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2386.644,2387.331,"Mr. Strum, if I --"
1978.77-1115,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.331,2395.143,"Well, what's wrong then with the day after the father dies, what's wrong with determining the inheritance?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2395.143,2399.455,"Well, you're then depriving the father of an opportunity to give evidence."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.439,2427.267,"How do we say that this statute is constitutional and not unconstitutional because the two-year provision will never be enforced, Is that what you want us to say?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2427.267,2428.152,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.948,2438.856,But it would -- we only have to talk about that statute?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2438.856,2439.093,"Yes, but I --"
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2439.093,2440.346,We don't have to mention it?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2440.346,2445.287,"I don't believe, Your Honor that we should be talking about a statute in the abstract necessarily."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2463.404,2465.998,You want us to just ignore the statute?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2465.998,2469.69,I would suggest that the two-year requirement is not applicable to this case.
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.69,2471.814,I'm saying about the statute?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2471.814,2474.069,"No, the statute should not be ignored, it should be enforced."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.069,2478.818,"Well, how can we mention the statute and ignore a part of it?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2478.818,2483.214,"Well, the part that we are ignoring or I suggest be ignored is not in this case."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2483.214,2492.788,You're saying in this case -- we say that this case which involves a 28-year-old man is not bound by the two-year old provision?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2492.788,2495.031,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.031,2498.124,I don't know what I think of somebody wrote that?
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2498.124,2510.156,"Well, is it true that the Courts in New York have all agreed that the two-year provision is invalid or should, should be ignored?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2510.156,2513.351,The Courts that have heard that question have agreed to that.
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2513.351,2514.26,"Yes, that's what I'm talking about."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.26,2516.135,And will you give us the citation so we --
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2516.135,2517.64,In his brief.
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2517.64,2519.233,"There are citations in the brief, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.233,2523.337,A citation would say that we are ignoring the two-year --
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2523.337,2524.841,"Yes, there are."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2526.919,2527.088,No.
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2531.037,2531.97,"Not those words, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2531.97,2534.633,"That's right, I didn't think you did."
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2536.982,2540.317,But the Courts have failed to apply it.
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2540.317,2543.612,Are we limited to do that?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2543.612,2551.527,"Well, I think you are limited to the facts in this case and the application of those facts to the statute."
1978.77-1115,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.527,2561.549,"Mr. Strum if we should disagree with you, I'm not -- don't know with the Court will do, on the issue of whether the requirement of affiliation during the lifetime of father is constitutional."
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2567.955,2578.274,"Well, I think if you're going to say that the requirement that it'd be during a lifetime of the father is unconstitutional then I think the whole statute would probably fail."
1978.77-1115,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.274,2596.197,"Then you would can see that the two years statute -- well, I don't understand how you can concede what you in substance do, although not quite in words that the two-year provision is unreasonable because it retreats some illegitimates irrationally in a different way from other illegitimates without a irrational justification."
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2606.368,2611.43,"I personally, I'm not suggesting to Your Honor that the two-year requirement is unreasonable."
1978.77-1115,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.43,2611.682,"Well, you just --"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2611.682,2615.114,I am saying to you that the New York Courts when considering the --
1978.77-1115,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.114,2621.913,"Well, you've said, “We should assume that the New York Courts would not enforce it because it's perfectly obvious that it's unreasonable,” that's the substance of what you've said --"
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.913,2622.975,You cite in this cases.
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2622.975,2623.632,Yes.
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2623.632,2623.66,On the bottom --
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2623.66,2631.742,Let me just quote the Court of Appeals because they have passed it on their own statute and they didn't say a word about the two-year?
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2631.742,2632.919,"No, they didn't because they felt it was not --"
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2632.919,2636.06,"Well, why don't we just base our opinion in what they say?"
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2636.06,2638.044,"Well, that's what I'm asking this Court to do."
1978.77-1115,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.044,2639.499,I see.
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2639.499,2640.248,The case --
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2640.248,2643.198,The only reason I raised the two-year question is because the appellant raised it.
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2643.198,2648.029,The case is to which you refer are those cited on the bottom page 4 of your briefs. Matter of Thomas --
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2648.029,2650.837,"Yes, Matter of Thomas, Matter of Flemm."
1978.77-1115,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2650.837,2651.728,Matter of Flemm.
1978.77-1115,1,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2651.728,2652.078,Yes.
1978.77-1115,2,41798,suzanne_mcgrattan,,2654.884,2655.994,Matter of --
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2655.994,2656.791,Yes.
1978.77-1115,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.941,2665.749,"Well, you already provided two of them and you represent that that's the -- that there are no cases contrary to that that you found?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2665.749,2675.123,I -- know no cases where that question has arisen where the New York Courts have applied that two-year statute.
1978.77-1115,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2721.183,2728.376,Or that -- or that the natural mother and the father have married either before or even after the birth of the illegitimate child?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2728.376,2729.74,"Yes, that would legitimatize."
1978.77-1115,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2729.74,2732.555,And even though the marriage be void or voidable?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2732.555,2733.274,Right.
1978.77-1115,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2742.757,2745.895,"You don't have to -- you don't have to have an acknowledgment, you just have to have a marriage, correct?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2745.895,2747.645,That's correct.
1978.77-1115,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2747.645,2748.598,Unlike the Illinois law?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2748.598,2761.536,"Unlike the Illinois statute and I submit that had the situation arose as applied in Illinois and New York, there would have been -- an inheritance would've been permitted because there was a Court order."
1978.77-1115,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.032,2772.048,You mean in New York somebody is got 56-year old child and they get married at that child is legitimatized?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2772.048,2772.36,Sure.
1978.77-1115,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2772.36,2773.906,Merely by the marriage?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2773.906,2775.64,That would legitimatize the child.
1978.77-1115,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2775.64,2776.674,"Well, Mr. Strum."
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2778.209,2779.735,"The natural father, yes."
1978.77-1115,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2779.735,2780.439,"Well, how do you know?"
1978.77-1115,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2782.063,2783.72,"That's right, doesn't it?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2783.72,2788.538,"Well, you wouldn't know except it would be a question to proof."
1978.77-1115,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.538,2789.375,Yes.
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.375,2801.751,"Mr. -- General Strum, let me question you once more about the state interest that this statute vindicates and we're talking about the requirement that the order be obtained during the lifetime of the father."
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2808.844,2809.594,That is one side of --
1978.77-1115,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.594,2812.985,"And how's -- oh, what else is there?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2812.985,2821.018,This -- also the state interest is in seeing to it that there's an orderly distribution of estates.
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2841.02,2841.676,Why?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2847.379,2851.063,But that -- because you would have to publish --
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.063,2858.923,You do it anyway because don't you occasionally have estates in which people claim to be legitimate children that there is a contest over there?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2858.923,2859.673,Yes.
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.711,2863.597,Don't you have to make that claim within a specified period of time?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2863.597,2864.449,"Oh, sure."
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.449,2867.542,Why couldn't the same rule take care of this problem?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2867.967,2878.396,"It could except -- except that you're going to have people who are going to come in and make claims and say, they didn't know or they had no opportunity of knowing."
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.396,2880.75,You have that with legitimates too.
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2889.763,2889.802,That's correct.
1978.77-1115,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.802,2892.282,"That's, that's the real reason for the cut-off."
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2914.826,2916.88,How Your Honor do you draw the line.
1978.77-1115,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.164,2919.406,Till we make to say in terms of standard of proof.
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2932.547,2934.856,"Well, again, I think -- I think --"
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.856,2937.772,"And then, do you not discriminate against some illegitimates?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2937.772,2938.147,No.
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2951.435,2952.855,This is not a standard of proof.
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2957.41,2958.869,Alright.
1978.77-1115,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2964.674,2965.784,It's a manner of proof?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2965.784,2966.691,That's correct.
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.741,3015.224,The sole justification according to you is to protect the right of the father to testify to the contrary when the record makes it clear he has no such desire?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3015.224,3019.145,"Well, but that's a determination that you making after fact."
1978.77-1115,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.142,3039.284,"What you're saying perhaps is that New York is not obliged to have a perfect statute, so long as they have a reasonable one?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3039.284,3041.342,I quite agree with the Chief Justice.
1978.77-1115,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3041.342,3049.045,Does the state take any position with respect to this claimant that all was to whether he is or is not the natural child of the decedent?
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3049.045,3050.958,I have no knowledge of the facts.
1978.77-1115,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3075.767,3078.43,"So, you're conceding nothing factual here, don't you?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3078.43,3079.342,"No, I'm not."
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3082.836,3090.353,"But it is clear that you're argument would be precisely the same, if you were prepared to concede the facts?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3090.353,3091.512,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1115,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.512,3094.82,"We should treat the legal issue as though the facts were tantamount to be in conceded, realizing that they would be challenged later?"
1978.77-1115,3,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3094.82,3096.048,I agree with that Your Honors.
1978.77-1115,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.665,3099.337,"Thank you, gentleman."
