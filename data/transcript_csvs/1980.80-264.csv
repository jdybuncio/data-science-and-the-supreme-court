1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.32,We'll hear arguments next in Staats v. Bristol Laboratories.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,138.907,141.257,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.427,364.003,"Mr. Levy, to what extent, if any, do you disagree with Judge Lasker's conclusion that we have to deal with this case in a contractual context rather than a statutory context?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,364.003,367.055,We think Judge Lasker fundamentally misconceived the question before the Court.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.388,527.625,May I interrupt just to get something on the table?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,536.381,541.785,We need that information in order to determine the full costs of the products that the Government bought.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.785,544.921,Would you challenge the fact that they spent as much as they say they spent on research?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,544.921,546.121,We don't know how much they spent on it.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.023,554.26,Don't they even given you the percentage of their total expenditures that go into research and development?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,554.26,557.978,"--I'm not aware that we have even that information, and if that information were available--"
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.978,563.532,"If they give you a balance sheet figure that this year we spent $97 million on research and development, would that satisfy you?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,563.532,568.269,--Subject to the need to verify the accuracy of that figure and any internal allocation--
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.269,570.452,"Well, say they gave you their tax returns that showed it was accurate?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,570.452,573.638,--Assuming that that's the same relevant definition of research and development--
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,573.638,577.375,What I'm asking you is do you really want to look at how much they spent on different kinds of experiments and--
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,577.375,578.242,"--No, we don't--"
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.242,581.827,--Do you really know what you're looking for here is why I'm asking these questions?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,581.827,585.112,"--What we're looking for is defined by the purpose of the statutes, I believe."
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.513,611.879,"Well, they tell you what's assignable to it."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,617.683,618.133,They don't.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,620.885,626.206,I don't know why you... I still don't understand why it's important to you to go behind some kind of a lump sum figure on all of those.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,626.206,629.258,--Because we don't have a lump sum figure on the totality of their costs.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.11,638.346,"If they charged you $10 for a product and they say, we can show that $2.90 is attributable to direct cost."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,642.334,648.154,And the Comptroller General needs to determine the reasonableness of that price in relation to the full cost.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.154,659.094,"Would it matter if, of the $7.10 in my hypothetical, if $1 was profit and $7 research or... I don't understand what difference it makes."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,669.485,671.402,We care because we need to determine what the full cost is of the products we buy.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.459,686.011,You always will know what the percentage of price that the direct costs represent.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,686.011,686.946,I don't believe so.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.683,693.817,They say none of it's assignable to the product.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,693.817,699.171,"They say none of it is allocated, but Bristol is conducting a pharmaceutical business here."
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,707.777,712.579,"Well, isn't the allocation what the Comptroller General is trying to find out about?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,712.579,714.847,That's exactly what the purpose of the inquiry is.
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,714.847,0.0,"You can't answer it without seeing it, can you?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,717.597,0.0,That's right.
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,781.67,789.526,"Mr. Levy, were these drugs standard drugs that were available for purchase by the public generally?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,789.526,793.061,"As I understand it, they were what are called ethical pharmaceuticals which require a prescription."
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,796.097,799.565,And did the Government pay the same price that the public paid?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,799.565,803.453,I believe it paid the standard wholesale price that Bristol offers.
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,803.453,809.94,Was there any suggestion that there was any conspiracy to maintain prices at an improper level?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,809.94,813.809,We did not allege that and we don't think that access depends on any antitrust theory.
1980.80-264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.809,821.997,"The statute, I take it, gives you the right to inquire in order to satisfy yourselves without just taking anybody's word on that?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,821.997,834.222,"I think that's one purpose and it may serve... the fact that this is a standard item sold to the public in substantial quantities gives some assurance, no question, that the price was reasonable."
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,838.524,847.38,"This is quite different, isn't it, from negotiating a contract to build a submarine or aircraft carrier or to buy an airplane or a tank?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,847.38,849.315,I presume it is different from those; that is correct.
1980.80-264,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,849.315,862.955,"Mr. Levy, at least don't you have some assurance when you just acknowledged that the price to the Government is comparable to what is charged other purchasers on a wholesale basis?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,862.955,872.763,"I think that is some assurance, but Congress determined that the market mechanism is not sufficient assurance to make sure that the public funds were not being unnecessarily expensed and that the prices charged the Government were not excessive."
1980.80-264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,881.869,887.69,"Well, isn't it possible too that Government could get a lower wholesale price?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,887.69,889.157,That might be possible.
1980.80-264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.157,894.011,"If they had full knowledge, as the statute seems to authorize them to do."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,894.011,902.181,"Exactly, because of the Government's unique position it might be able to better procurement techniques to obtain a price more favorable than that customarily charged the general public."
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.181,903.097,May I ask one other question about the rate?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,914.072,914.739,We do disagree with that.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.739,916.722,What is it that they would not have to show you?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,916.722,923.51,It's hard for me to identify document by document since GAO hasn't yet had the opportunity to study the record-keeping system of Bristol.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.796,927.162,"Well, you've had some opportunity."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,928.595,932.697,"--They did but no inspection has yet occurred, pending the outcome of this litigation."
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.502,996.389,In other words your purpose is to see if you cannot allocate costs to non-government business.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,998.008,1003.126,The thoroughness of the audit will depend in large part on the record-keeping that the respondent maintains.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.412,1007.864,"You haven't looked at what they've given you yet, either."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1007.864,1008.464,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.464,1009.982,You have not looked at what they've given you yet?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1009.982,1012.768,"We have not, as I say, pending the outcome of this litigation."
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.357,1059.047,"Well, Mr. Levy, you do have the problem, I gather, that when Congress amended this statute to add ""directly pertains to"" it had some purpose in mind in the way of limitation, didn't it?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1059.047,1062.099,"--I'll confess it's hard to know what Congress had in mind, but, no, we--"
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1062.099,1067.653,"No, no, but doesn't this language on its face suggest Congress was imposing a limitation?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1067.653,1069.104,--I don't believe so.
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1069.104,1069.72,Oh.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1069.72,1074.489,"Because, first, I don't think that the language ""directly pertinent"", on the face of the statute--"
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1074.489,1076.774,"Well, if that was added to the statute?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1076.774,1079.543,"--the modifier ""directly"" was added as a floor amendment--"
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1079.543,1083.947,And isn't there some legislative history that suggests it was added because Congress wanted to limit it?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1083.947,1085.714,--The legislative history is very sparse.
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.184,1091.784,Why do you think Congress added that word?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1091.784,1096.855,I think the word serves only as one of emphasis to underscore to GAO--
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1096.855,1099.624,Congress went to all this trouble just to add that word?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1099.624,1100.79,"--Well, it wasn't all this trouble."
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1157.711,1159.763,And what do you say Congress' purpose was?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1159.763,1176.624,"We think its purpose there was simply to emphasize to GAO that it should have a legitimate need before undertaking examination of a contractor's records and should not, in the language of the Representative introducing the amendment, should not go ""snooping"" without reason."
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1197.038,1199.99,What would you do to them if they don't give you this information?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1199.99,1206.476,"Well, what has happened here is we've brought lawsuits, or where a drug company is involved--"
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1206.476,1207.459,I thought they brought the lawsuit.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1207.459,1210.861,"--Well, in one or two cases we commenced litigation and in the others the drug companies did."
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1210.861,1211.411,To do what?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1211.411,1218.967,"Usually to seek declaratory and injunctive relief, either to enforce our rights under the contracting statute or to prevent GAO's inspection."
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1218.967,1223.705,"Now, assuming that they tell you, we're not going to give you the information, what can you do about it?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1223.705,1225.888,We would initiate litigation.
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1226.74,1230.859,And to make them give it to you under pain of going to jail?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1230.859,1236.529,"--Oh, I fully believe so if they violated a court order that construes the statutes in accordance with our--"
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1236.529,1238.163,But you're not under a court order yet.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1240.981,1245.368,"--Yes, and if we prevailed, then we would have a court order that could be enforced."
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1245.368,1247.368,And your only basis for it is what?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1247.368,1261.211,"The language of the statutes, the legislative history, and it would be based on GAO's legal right to review these records in order to determine the Government procurement system is working efficiently and economically in its expenditure of public funds."
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1261.211,1271.935,"Suppose, Mr. Levy, that for whatever reasons the Department of Justice reached the point where it thought that there were some problems."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1280.957,1284.926,I must say I don't know what the authority of the FBI is.
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.147,1290.963,Would it have to be criminal?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1290.963,1294.432,--Something within the legitimate domain of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1294.432,1300.603,"It could be here or it could be a civil claim, a potential civil claim against the company for overcharges, or--"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1300.603,1307.441,"If this were a claim that were subject to renegotiation and if that's a proper purpose of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, certainly they could investigate it."
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1309.358,1318.214,"--Well, as a matter of fact, couldn't we take judicial notice that that's precisely what the Department of Justice does and has done for many, many years?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1318.214,1318.764,--I believe the Court could take notice of the function of the agency.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.685,1350.301,"Mr. Levy, let me ask you one question."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1357.705,1361.74,"In this case the contracts are not subject to the Renegotiation Act, which in any event has now expired."
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.74,1362.573,Don't you have another remedy?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1369.41,1378.35,"Prospectively, that would be true, but I think we have a right even as to contracts that are in existence now and have been previously executed, and I thought that was the question Mr. Justice Marshall was addressing to me."
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1378.35,1386.605,"Of course, some courts of appeals' opinions have held that that they can't ""blacklist"" a contractor without some kind of notice and hearing."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1388.938,1389.723,I don't think at all that this is black-listing.
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1404.733,1414.088,"--Well, Mr. Levy, if you've got everything you wanted and then it was determined that the price was 25 cents too high, would you be able to recoup it from the--"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1414.088,1421.159,"Not in this case, as I say, these contracts are not subject to the Renegotiation Act which expired in 1976, in any event."
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1438.554,1442.506,"--But you wouldn't be able to get that excess back, would you?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1442.506,1444.692,Not for the previously expended monies.
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1444.692,1447.042,"Incidentally, we have no constitutional question here at all?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1447.042,1450.494,"There is no constitutional question, as I say, I believe it's solely a statutory question."
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1450.494,1451.046,It's nothing but the statute?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1451.046,1451.879,That's correct.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.879,1454.381,"Is this a public company, by the way?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1454.381,1457.416,A public company under the Securities and Exchange Act?
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.416,0.0,"Yes, do they have publicly available financial statements?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1460.385,0.0,Yes.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.824,1473.859,"I see, so they may not have division accounting?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1473.859,1480.946,"Exactly, but Bristol-Myers is the parent of the unincorporated division and is a publicly registered corporation."
1980.80-264,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.282,1541.901,"Well, it's a little bit like a congressional investigation, isn't it?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1553.891,1555.743,I'm sure a committee of Congress could do that.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.74,1611.328,"When you ask for full access, I guess you really want to read the words ""directly pertinent""... I mean, the statute, as though those words just weren't in the statute?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1611.328,1613.18,"No, we think that wording in the statute--"
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.18,1617.565,"Because you haven't suggested to me any limit on what you want to see, which you have the right to see."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1622.786,1625.421,--I don't think that would be at all necessary.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.338,1628.106,"Well, Judge Lasker thought it would be in this case."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1641.18,1642.199,--I think I can.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1653.84,1659.475,Would you say that even if research and development is combined for all those other divisions in this division?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1659.475,1661.244,--Then there would be an allocation of the total pool.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.244,1661.844,Who would make it?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1669.081,1671.1,And they say they're unable to allocate it?
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.1,1673.885,They just as a matter of accounting practice don't allocate it.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1673.885,1674.402,Okay.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.152,1676.968,They always could.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1678.37,1680.639,--We would accept that allocation subject to verification--
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.639,1684.924,--But you would want to be able to verify it by looking at the records of the foreign business and the veterinary business.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1684.924,1686.71,--If it were necessary to do that--
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.71,1692.364,So there is really no category you don't want to have the right to look at if you think it's necessary in order to make a proper allocation.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1692.364,1696.831,--Only if it's necessary to verify the information that we have been otherwise provided.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1696.831,1704.421,"Well, they say, we don't allocate, and you say, you have a duty to allocate, and if you don't do it yourself we want to look at the records that will enable us to do it."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1704.421,1710.325,Then we would take a look at the total for all and allocate the portion that's representative to the pharmaceutical industry.
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1710.325,1711.841,That you determine as representative.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1711.841,1716.562,"In consultations, as GAO always does in accordance with standard practice, with the respondent--"
1980.80-264,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1716.562,1722.466,"Incidentally, was 254(c) the same time 2313(b)?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1722.466,1726.213,"--Yes, they were a part of that same common statute that were enacted at the same time."
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1726.213,1730.12,"Mr. Levy, you said that even if there were no allocation the company would have to do it."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1745.396,1748.246,Are you asking how Bristol has held--
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1748.246,1750.064,How any company; how would you do it?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1764.208,1767.325,"--That's right, and that's exactly the reason why an allocation is necessary."
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1767.325,1768.125,How do you allocate it?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1778.117,1781.402,The records in question here would only relate to the period when the contracts were in question.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.951,1807.634,"But in each case they say, well, we don't do it."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1813.269,1815.788,In accordance with established accounting principles.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.788,1820.59,"--There are a lot of established, you know, acceptable accounting practices, there are all sorts of alternatives that are available."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1820.59,1823.358,"There are, and that's why we need to discuss it fully with the contractor and--"
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.358,1831.131,It seems to me it's always true that when they don't allocate themselves you're going to have to look at everything to decide what method of allocation you're going to think is the proper one.
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1831.131,1837.367,"That sort of investigation could take years, with dozens of accountants, in a great corporation like this one."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1842.605,1844.721,--We think there is the limitation.
1980.80-264,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1855.513,1859.548,"Well, in this case, you've been limited to that extent, but your principle has no limit."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1859.548,1860.833,I think it does.
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.038,1899.025,"It would be the end of it if they said, we allocate 90 percent of our research and development to the Government contracts, you don't think you'd go behind that?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1899.025,1900.791,If we have reasons to suspect it then--
1980.80-264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.791,1902.16,"Well, you would have reason to suspect it."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1902.16,1903.41,--Only if there's some question about it.
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.749,1914.285,"Who decides what's pertinent, though?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1914.285,1919.237,I think in the end that's a question of law that the Court would decide.
1980.80-264,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1919.237,1924.74,"As between the contractor and the Government, who decides what's pertinent?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1924.74,1930.127,"I think that's worked out in an informal negotiation procedure, as it is in civil discovery or subpoena requests."
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1947.089,1965.567,"Well, isn't one of the broad objectives, to go to the objectives, to determine whether there is a misallocation, that is allocating to some of the Government contracts costs which in good sound practice should be allocated elsewhere?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1965.567,1972.621,"Certainly, and that happens all the time in cost-based contracts where the contractor seeks reimbursement on the basis of his costs allocable to the Government's contract."
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1979.66,1987.999,"And when we had the contract renegotiation statute and the Renegotiation Board, that was the whole object of that enterprise, was it not?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1987.999,1995.487,"Exactly, although my understanding there was that it was not done on a contract basis as we would do here but it was done on a broad or corporate basis, but I think in principle it's much the same."
1980.80-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.487,2013.281,Do we judge this case on the... is it submitted on the assumption by one or both sides that research and development costs were a part of the costs of the Government's products or not?
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,2013.281,2021.554,We think it's incontrovertible that the Government's payments... that the research and development expenses incurred at the relevant time were borne by the Government--
1980.80-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.554,2026.791,Your opponent says that they... those costs did not directly contribute to the Government's costs.
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,2026.791,2032.378,--What they say is that they didn't expressly consider them in setting the prices in the day and their business practices don't allocate them.
1980.80-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.971,0.0,"Well, what if it was?"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,2055.958,2064.564,"I believe that the respondent concedes that if this were a cost-based contract, we would be entitled to audit the records in order to determine whether the reimbursement was properly charged."
1980.80-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.564,2066.447,"Well, you'd just audit what they've put down as their cost."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,2066.447,2067.933,And we would make sure--
1980.80-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.933,2076.121,"If they made, if they put down, if they didn't put down any, and didn't allocate any research and development cost to it, to your cost, you wouldn't audit their research and development."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,2076.121,2078.923,--I think it's inconceivable that in claiming reimbursement on any cost-based--
1980.80-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.923,2085.477,"That may be; that may be, but as I understand their submission here that they say they didn't--"
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,2085.477,2088.846,--If they elect to forego reimbursement for those costs in a cost-based contract--
1980.80-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.846,2091.881,"--Oh, they're going to get their money out for... but they aren't going to get it from the Government."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,2091.881,2102.106,"--We wish them well in that endeavor, then, but when it's the Government's interest that is being protected by the Comptroller General's investigation, we think that their decision on what they do with cost-based contracts is not controlling."
1980.80-264,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.106,2112.728,"So you're saying you can't in this, on the facts here, you just can't tell whether or not their research and development costs entered into the price charged the Government, and therefore you must be able to find out."
1980.80-264,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,2112.728,2115.247,"I think the ambiguity is where you say,"
1980.80-264,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2147.051,2149.52,Now I think we'd better hear from your friend.
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2152.455,2155.907,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-264,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.195,2218.997,"Well, doesn't that hurt you rather than help you?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2227.169,2231.371,"That is correct, but if we're searching for a legislative intent--"
1980.80-264,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.371,2241.929,"Maybe the legislature wanted to have the Government have access to all of your records in any of these kinds of contracts, for whatever purpose the Government sought."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2241.929,2247.083,"--If the Congress had said that, there'd be no question about it, but the Congress did not say that."
1980.80-264,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.083,2255.086,"But the statute it passed places only the limits ""directly pertinent to""."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2255.086,2257.288,"These open the question of, pertinent to what?"
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.388,2282.471,"Well, let's take the overreaching now."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2300.35,2304.419,"I agree thoroughly on those facts, but those are not the facts of this case, Your Honor."
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2304.419,2307.788,"I'm taking about the purpose of the statute, as you were."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2307.788,2308.855,Yes.
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2308.855,2315.709,"Now, that's the Comptroller General's mandate from the Congress, to inquire into that."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2315.709,2327.702,"Yes, and Your Honor's question is directed again to pertinency, pertinency for the prices that were charged the Government and what went into determining those prices."
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2339.325,2355.686,I suppose you and I would agree on the basis of experience that sometimes research and development simply cannot be allocated with precision.
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2355.686,2358.221,--Most times.
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2358.221,2359.704,That you just don't know.
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2369.296,2369.546,Yes.
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2390.376,2392.911,Isn't that true of almost all R&D?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2392.911,2394.427,I suspect that it is.
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2402.767,2411.706,"Well, even conceding its difficulty, would you agree that there could be a deliberate misallocation in the interest of the producer?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2411.706,2413.825,--There could be theoretically.
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2419.562,2422.931,Why would you limit it to cost-plus contracts?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2428.501,2441.325,"Oh, but the statutory provision, Your Honor, relates to the particular contract that contains the clause that is the subject of this case."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.914,2494.976,"Well, Mr. Weil, suppose you've got, you do have R&D expense and let's suppose that to develop certain products, A, B, C, which you are selling to the Government, you did have research and development costs."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2516.456,2516.823,Yes.
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.823,2519.258,"--Now, how about those research and development costs?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2529.614,2543.123,"May I... and I did point this out in our brief, but I think it would bear re iteration here: try to be prophylactic against an ambiguity in the term ""allocate""."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.799,2583.1,Then you don't allocate them?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2583.1,2588.652,"--We don't allocate them to the price, and it's price that counts here."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.473,2598.443,"Is there some finding, as a matter of fact, that you did not allocate them to price?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2598.443,2599.377,"Oh, yes, yes."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.329,2608.566,And that you certainly recover R&D cost from somebody?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2608.566,2613.537,"We do it eventually out of the general pool, but we do not--"
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.537,2616.505,Including the profits you make on the Government contract?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2616.505,2625.694,"--As with any business, all revenue eventually is available to meet any expense of the business."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.694,2627.796,Like getting interest on bank loans?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2627.796,2632.431,"Anything; anything becomes available to meet an expense, if it's needed."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.101,2663.22,In order to make up the loss.
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2663.22,2665.186,--They've got to make it up somewhere.
1980.80-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.795,2685.263,"As you develop this, would you tell us in a little more detail what records you are willing to tender to the Government?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2685.263,2687.115,"Yes, we have that in our brief."
1980.80-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.805,2702.624,"Do they know, for example, what your aggregate research and development costs are?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2702.624,2732.744,"Well, they can... no, they don't, Your Honor, but by simple arithmetic subtraction of the price they pay, from the price that the Government pays, of the costs that we do give them, they know that the residue has to be all the unallocated costs, namely, general overhead and administration, general distribution, and research and development, and promotion and advertising."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.744,2734.096,And maybe just a hair of profit?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2734.096,2736.548,"Well, we hope so."
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2901.237,2914.764,"Well, but Mr. Weil, would you not agree that sometimes you cannot make a determination whether it is directly related until after you see them all?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2914.764,2919.216,"Well, that might be, but I think there is some--"
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2919.216,2923.102,"The Comptroller General can't demonstrate that in advance, can he?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,2923.102,2931.791,"--Well, that would mean then, Your Honor, I fear, that the Comptroller General would be able to see everything he wants to see even though he is not entitled to see it."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.387,3009.375,"Well, Mr. Weil, from what you've said so far I take it you think that some cost figures are required by the statute?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3009.375,3012.077,"Yes, and we've agreed that the Government can have them."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.077,3018.064,They you don't agree with some of the amicus views that--
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3018.064,3020.849,We don't disagree with them.
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.849,3034.776,"--Well, I take it, it is submitted by something I read that no cost figures in a fixed price contract is required by the statute to be turned over."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3034.776,3045.464,I think that is their argument where the prices in the fixed contract do not result from negotiations that discussed or took into account any particular costs.
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.464,3048.333,"If you don't submit any cost figures to the Government, you don't have to verify them?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3048.333,3051.535,"In the course of negotiation, and I believe that is the way--"
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3051.535,3052.118,Is that true here?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3052.118,3055.939,--We did not submit any costs to the Government.
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3055.939,3066.561,"So that, if you agreed with your, with the amicus that I read, there wouldn't be any cost figures called for by the--"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3066.561,3071.882,"Under that theory and the type of contract we're dealing with here, there would be no cost figures."
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.882,3076.0,--You don't urge us to adopt that position?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3078.619,3080.036,I don't disagree with it either.
1980.80-264,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3092.344,3093.711,At least it's not your case?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3093.711,3094.761,It is not our case.
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.761,3099.865,"Well, it is in the sense that you didn't submit any cost figures."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3099.865,3106.103,"It would be if we didn't submit, but we have agreed that we will submit the cost figures--"
1980.80-264,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3106.103,3108.471,But you didn't submit them in the course of negotiations?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3108.471,3109.355,"--Oh, no, no."
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3110.257,3113.542,Let me take you back to that amendment.
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3148.262,3161.939,"Your Honor, respectfully, I would read it the other way as being a further constriction that there must be direct pertinence to transactions which relate to the contract."
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3176.414,3181.334,"The Comptroller says that's what he wants to find out, whether they're related to and whether they are directly."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3181.334,3182.418,And that's my point.
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3243.308,3244.341,Mr. Weil?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3244.341,3245.193,"Yes, sir?"
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3245.193,3248.462,There's been a good deal of talk about R&D expenses.
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3252.847,3256.318,I don't believe they are separately broken out.
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3256.318,3265.506,"Most pharmaceuticals, I had thought, were very proud of their R&D expenditures and reported them, either in their annual reports on in their 10-K's."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3265.506,3272.16,"I hesitate to give a firm answer, Your Honor, because I just don't know."
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3275.462,3276.062,"Well, perhaps not."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3276.845,3285.301,"And if they were, they might be broken out on a total corporate basis rather than by Bristol Laboratories Division of Bristol-Myers."
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3285.301,3289.686,"--Would you... first of all, is the contract in the record somewhere or other?"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3293.621,3303.513,"--No, I don't believe the full contract is there but the Joint Appendix does show an identification of the contracts."
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3316.153,3323.224,Does the contract indicate what types of drugs beyond being prescription?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3333.715,3348.641,I think that virtually all of them would be competing in the sense that if the identical formula is not available that alternates would be available to achieve the same pharmacological results.
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3348.641,3350.743,And these are priced--
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3350.743,3352.026,There's considerable elasticity.
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3352.026,3354.045,--These are wholesale prices that are published?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3359.182,3361.249,I believe they are; yes.
1980.80-264,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3371.407,3377.977,"So, as Mr. Levy said, the competitive market would be a restraint on any holding up of the Government."
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3377.977,3392.42,"Well, on that point, and on Mr. Justice Blackmun's question about whether there isn't some assurance from the competitive aspect that the prices are right, we can turn again to the legislative history."
1980.80-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3838.942,3841.228,May I ask just one question about the statute?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3847.215,3848.364,"No, it does not."
1980.80-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3856.403,3857.82,And how did this suit arise?
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3858.772,3859.922,"No, no."
1980.80-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3865.359,3866.843,But they have no remedy.
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3872.58,3877.234,"Well, it would be more than an implied cause of action, or they'd have an action on contract."
1980.80-264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3878.917,3881.119,"--So it has to be breach of contract, unless there's a--"
1980.80-264,1,26289,gilbert_h_weil,,3881.119,3882.388,There has to be; yes.
1980.80-264,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3891.243,3891.66,"Thank you, gentlemen."
