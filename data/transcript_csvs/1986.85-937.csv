1986.85-937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-937, West Virginia versus the United States."
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,13.908,21.163,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1972, amid torrential rains, a dam burst in southern West Virginia."
1986.85-937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,64.506,67.208,"You mean in favor of the United States, don't you, rather than against the United States?"
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,67.208,74.548,Reversed... the Fourth Circuit reversed in favor of the United States... excuse me... applying cases involving private litigants in suits against the Federal Government.
1986.85-937,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.212,255.782,"General Brown, did you rely on the Debt Collection Act in the Court of Appeals?"
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,255.782,258.317,"No, we did not."
1986.85-937,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.351,261.685,Do you think you can raise a new argument in this Court that you didn't raise there?
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,261.685,263.905,"Justice Stevens, we don't think we are raising a new argument."
1986.85-937,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,271.91,274.779,You were arguing there was no authorization.
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,279.581,283.099,We argued heavily Board of Commissioners of Jackson County.
1986.85-937,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.132,308.0,--Did you make this argument in your principal brief.
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,308.0,308.883,"Yes, we did."
1986.85-937,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.883,315.254,Where was that?
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,315.254,325.378,We made the argument that the starting point has to be the Act of Congress and we focused in our principal brief not on the Debt Collection Act but on the Disaster Relief Act.
1986.85-937,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.378,327.445,Did you say anything about the Debt Collection Act in your principal brief?
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,327.445,328.497,"No, we did not."
1986.85-937,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.497,336.168,So you come in with a reply brief that the other side hasn't had an opportunity... has no opportunity to respond to.
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,348.41,350.477,"Mr. Justice Scalia, we apologize."
1986.85-937,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.849,371.341,"Just to clarify it, you are not urging us to hold that the Debt Collection Act applies to a previously entered into agreement, are you?"
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,371.341,374.978,"We think that the Debt Collection Act... no, you don't need to do that."
1986.85-937,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,383.399,399.093,"Well, it is certainly possible that Congress included the provision that it did in the Debt Collection Act about interest against states because it thought that otherwise the rule was to the contrary under Federal common law."
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,399.093,406.68,I think Congress has said that they are supporting the common law and they will decide when the states are to pay interest.
1986.85-937,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.664,433.197,Excuse me.
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,468.405,482.497,"The solicitor, us having dealt with the case in a footnote, the solicitor deals with the case in the footnote on Page 9 of the solicitor's brief in opposition to cert, so they mention it at that point."
1986.85-937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,675.571,691.248,"You mean just as a matter of general law, General Brown... certainly if this were a quasi-contract or money had in received action between private individuals and the bill had been sent that didn't indicate interest, I wouldn't think under ordinary common law that would preclude a claim of interest."
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,691.248,704.223,"No, it would not, but I was just talking about the word ""charges"" as not reaching into the word ""interest"" because Congress at other points such as in the Social Security Act and the Medicaid Act have indeed said that there should be interest."
1986.85-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,725.886,730.873,"General Brown, would you tell me what your understanding of the holding of the Jackson County case is?"
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,730.873,731.106,Yes.
1986.85-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.55,749.418,Weren't there a number of other equitable factors in the case as well?
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,749.418,776.485,"After he made that decision that there would be no interest for the state, he said, however, if we had to rule on general equity we would rule with Jackson County Commission as well, so as I read Justice Frankfurter's opinion he held for the state solely on that basis... held for the County and the state would have at least as much basis a fortiori as the county would, but he held first solely on that equitable ground."
1986.85-937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.306,786.774,Do you think there are any equities supporting the state's position here?
1986.85-937,0,18334,charles_g_brown,,786.774,790.892,"Yes, yes, yes, I think there are."
1986.85-937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.988,863.857,"Thank you, General Brown."
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,874.063,881.319,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I would like to make three points about the Debt Collection Act to begin with."
1986.85-937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.14,887.872,By its terms?
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,887.872,888.54,By its terms.
1986.85-937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,946.511,948.394,"You may have to litigate some time, I suppose."
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,948.394,951.13,We are litigating that right now in several Courts of Appeals and have not--
1986.85-937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.13,952.082,"Yes, I would think you would."
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,952.082,972.745,"--and have not prevailed thus far, but even if we don't prevail on that argument, as the Third Circuit held, the effect of the Act would be to abrogate the common law rule under which the Third Circuit held we were entitled to interest, and because the common law rule applies here, that would lead us to win this case, we hope."
1986.85-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1514.845,1520.066,"Although Congress doesn't now think so, anyway."
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1520.066,1524.553,That depends on whether we are right in our construction of the Debt Collection Act.
1986.85-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.553,1526.02,For the future.
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1533.408,1535.694,We don't think it is clear yet.
1986.85-937,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.694,1535.994,Why?
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1535.994,1557.958,"Because our interpretation of that '82 Act is that by excepting the states from the definition of ""person"" the statute merely excepted the state from mandatory interest pursuant to the statute and preserved the status quo ante under which states could be held liable under the common law where applicable."
1986.85-937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.982,1857.954,"Yet you have the Jackson County case, which of course suggests that the fact that the state is a litigant in the action is entitled to some consideration."
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1857.954,1877.932,"--Well, the opinion there referred to state... to local institutions and what Justice Frankfurter went on to say was that under the more modern law of the Court, Indians had come to be regarded increasingly as like any other citizens."
1986.85-937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.941,1949.564,"Mr. Lauber, isn't it also true that there was no question about the state's interest as a litigant because the state wasn't a litigant in that case, it was just the county?"
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1949.564,1950.364,It was just the county.
1986.85-937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.647,1955.951,"So their argument they rely on that case ought to apply to counties as well, I suppose."
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1955.951,1959.403,I think they would make the same argument for any political subdivision as well as for themselves.
1986.85-937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.768,1989.005,Or in this case you would say you resort to state law but the exemption just isn't applicable.
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1989.005,1990.291,That would be another way of putting it.
1986.85-937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.657,1992.441,"Well, which one?"
1986.85-937,1,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1998.445,2008.419,"We think the proper approach is to adopt the Federal rule, and the fact it is the same as the general state rule maybe makes an even stronger case for doing that."
1986.85-937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.563,2080.181,"Thank you, Mr. Lauber."
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2084.451,2085.668,I have a few brief points.
1986.85-937,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.99,2125.544,But even during the period when the state was acknowledging the debt it wasn't paying it.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2137.102,2143.772,"Justice Scalia, the government alleged that the state was acknowledging the debt through letters from the Governor and other officials."
1986.85-937,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.82,2272.074,"General Brown, I understood Mr. Lauber to say that the state never pays it because there is an exception for the state in West Virginia--"
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2272.074,2272.674,--Yes.
1986.85-937,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.674,2277.544,--but that prejudgment interest is normally awarded between private litigants in a contractual type--
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2277.544,2280.496,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-937,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.346,2331.146,--May I just interrupt--
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2331.146,2331.529,Yes.
1986.85-937,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.529,2333.465,--on your notion about hurting innocent taxpayers.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2336.667,2337.133,Some taxpayers.
1986.85-937,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.133,2340.885,--either the West Virginia taxpayers or by the taxpayers of the country as a whole.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2344.42,2344.772,That's right.
1986.85-937,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.772,2349.824,And the taxpayers from California and other states are innocent in the same sense.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2349.824,2350.34,That's right.
1986.85-937,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2360.615,2366.852,And of course I gather on that point the Federal Government did pay a fair amount of money in connection with the disaster--
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2366.852,2367.319,We both did.
1986.85-937,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.319,2368.138,--that was not recoverable.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2368.138,2368.604,We both did.
1986.85-937,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.238,2370.871,How much did the Federal Government pay?
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2370.871,2374.208,--I believe $30 million.
1986.85-937,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.265,2402.275,"Why isn't it fair to have the cost of the use of the money borne by the people who have been using the money, which is the taxpayers of West Virginia, who should have paid up the money many years ago, and have been using it in the interim?"
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2410.065,2414.083,We are asking them to appropriate in 1987 based on a 1972 disaster.
1986.85-937,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.75,2418.904,"--That may well be, but they have had the use of that money during that whole interim period."
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2421.154,2427.342,"--I believe because historically it has always been that way, Justice Scalia, that the sovereign, it doesn't have prejudgment interest against it."
1986.85-937,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.426,2434.413,"That may be, but, I am just... as a historical matter it may be, but there is no overwhelming fairness case."
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2445.888,2459.731,"--If the states could act with the celerity of a private person, as Justice Holmes said once, that may be the same thing, but the states simply are not called on to do that, and the historical basis is, we have budgets and we have delays in putting all that together."
1986.85-937,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.814,2464.6,Maybe that is why you do a better job of balancing your budget than the Federal Government does.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2465.634,2468.334,"--We have a smaller budget to deal with, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-937,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.334,2474.49,Don't you have some trouble with Courts of Appeals cases?
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2479.942,2483.513,"In fact, we have the Second Circuit, Third Circuit, and Ninth Circuit."
1986.85-937,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.148,2488.798,What Courts of Appeals agree with you?
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2488.798,2490.417,--Second and Third Circuit agree with us.
1986.85-937,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.417,2491.3,And how about the other side?
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2491.3,2493.119,The only side that doesn't is the Ninth Circuit.
1986.85-937,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.286,2523.554,Is the Pennsylvania case the Third Circuit case?
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2523.554,2529.708,"Yes, it is, Pennsylvania v. U.S. Perales is affirming a Southern District of New York case that--"
1986.85-937,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.708,2532.16,What do you do with Clearfield?
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2532.16,2533.446,"--Your Honor, on Clearfield?"
1986.85-937,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2533.446,2533.962,Yes.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2533.962,2538.648,We think the Clearfield line and the Royal Indemnity Line are private parties.
1986.85-937,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.192,2560.679,There are two groups of taxpayers in this case whether your taxes or my taxes pay the bill?
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2560.679,2562.663,"Somebody's taxes are going to pay for this, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-937,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2562.663,2563.981,Either yours or mine?
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2563.981,2565.181,That's correct.
1986.85-937,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2565.181,2567.433,So that is two taxpayers groups.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2567.433,2568.033,"Yes, it is."
1986.85-937,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2568.033,2571.452,So that is Clearfield.
1986.85-937,2,18334,charles_g_brown,,2571.452,2572.987,"Yes, it is."
1986.85-937,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2611.426,2612.112,"Thank you, General Brown."
