1973.73-604,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.537,"We will hear arguments next in Cass against the United States, 73-604, Adams against the Secretary of Navy, 73-5661."
1973.73-604,0,16261,arthur_b_hanson,,31.526,37.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1973.73-604,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,55.949,59.827,"That plea will be granted Mr. Hanson, you may take even a little more time if you need it."
1973.73-604,0,16261,arthur_b_hanson,,59.827,61.228,Thank you sir.
1973.73-604,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,63.735,66.163,Yes of course.
1973.73-604,0,16261,arthur_b_hanson,,66.163,70.128,"And Your Honors, we would like to call your attention to two items."
1973.73-604,1,44452,william_a_dougherty,,1025.108,1029.798,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.73-604,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.387,1176.846,You're not suggesting that 6330 covers your client because 6330 among other things applies only to enlisted personnel and also only to those who have completed 20 or more years?
1973.73-604,1,44452,william_a_dougherty,,1179.264,1189.658,My point is that 6330 allows a six months rounding figure both as to regulars and to reserves and I think that’s significant.
1973.73-604,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1237.165,1255.019,Does that help your case any Mr. Dougherty that the statute Justice Stewart just cited to you contains an expressed provision for rounding out when there's less than the full period and the statute contains no such rounding out provision?
1973.73-604,1,44452,william_a_dougherty,,1255.019,1260.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, it’s our position that the “rounding” provisions of both statutes are exactly the same."
1973.73-604,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1268.763,1275.051,"Well at least is -- those are two pretty important words in that statute, are they not?"
1973.73-604,1,44452,william_a_dougherty,,1275.051,1287.702,"But if you take the subsection (2) as defining the word year, it says, “A period of six months or more” and it says, “For purposes of this subsection,” that means the whole subsection."
1973.73-604,2,45815,william_l_patton,,1402.691,1406.097,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.73-604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.236,1591.633,"Well, wouldn’t that be equally true under 6330?"
1973.73-604,2,45815,william_l_patton,,1591.633,1593.143,It would be under 6330.
1973.73-604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.328,1604.337,"Well, it’s your --"
1973.73-604,2,45815,william_l_patton,,1604.337,1605.487,And --
1973.73-604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1605.487,1610.485,-- submission but I’m just asking now about this little argument you’ve made --
1973.73-604,2,45815,william_l_patton,,1610.485,1612.03,I agree that --
1973.73-604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1612.03,1618.353,That the less than six months would have no meaning if the petitioner’s construction were accepted.
1973.73-604,3,44452,william_a_dougherty,,2427.553,2432.16,"May it please the Court Mr. Chief Justice, I’ll be brief."
1973.73-604,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2483.648,2485.826,Well you have a different situation here Mr. Dougherty.
1973.73-604,3,44452,william_a_dougherty,,2485.826,2486.48,Yes sir.
1973.73-604,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.48,2494.993,"Up until 1962, it was very clear that this statute meant precisely what the government now says."
1973.73-604,3,44452,william_a_dougherty,,2499.141,2502.017,"1956 to 1962, agree."
1973.73-604,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2502.017,2508.161,There's none and because the statute was crystal clear that --
1973.73-604,3,44452,william_a_dougherty,,2508.161,2508.961,It applied only to --
1973.73-604,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2508.961,2513.067,Then they applied only to those who had served actually five years or more.
1973.73-604,3,44452,william_a_dougherty,,2513.067,2514.949,Yes.
1973.73-604,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2514.949,2522.889,"And then what happened was there was recodified and there's a statement in one of the committee reports, that of the Senate that no change was intended."
1973.73-604,3,44452,william_a_dougherty,,2529.024,2529.597,Yes sir.
1973.73-604,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2555.08,2561.699,"Well, but nevertheless between 1956 and 1962, it would’ve been quite clear that the statutes have a different meaning."
1973.73-604,3,44452,william_a_dougherty,,2561.699,2563.521,"Yes, I agree with that sir."
