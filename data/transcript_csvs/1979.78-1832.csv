1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.167,We will hear arguments next in Cuyler against Sullivan.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,62.363,64.902,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,104.362,105.565,When was this case tried?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,105.565,107.02,1967.
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,107.02,107.602,June?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,107.602,112.084,The crime -- excuse me -- the crime occurred in June of 1966.
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.151,158.651,Each one of them was tried separately?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,158.651,161.145,"Tried separately and acquitted, yes."
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,162.573,163.902,There were two subsequent trials?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,163.902,166.712,"Yes, there were."
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.887,200.031,Where is this gentleman been in the meantime?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,201.013,202.61,He is not incarcerated at this time.
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.931,215.555,So he's been incarcerated some 10 or 11 years?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,215.555,217.468,"He was, yes."
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,338.334,345.298,"Well, if they believed Judge DiBona, they didn't have much alternative about the decision, did they?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,345.298,358.745,"The Third Circuit, however, the panel, when they got the case, held that the legal conclusion that there was no dual representation was erroneous; that there was a clear indication on the record that there was dual representation."
1979.78-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.391,400.529,"Well, Mr. Goldblatt, before you get to that, in your question three, on your petition for certiorari, you raise the -- whether the Federal court failed to give proper deference to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's determination on a factual issue; that is, whether there was a conflict of interest."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,418.178,428.428,"What I am saying -- argument three, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe goes to the question, assuming the Third Circuit panel is correct in their conclusion -- two conclusions, one that there is evidence of dual representation on the record."
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,462.578,465.461,When was the issue of dual representation first raised?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,465.461,470.301,"The issue of dual representation was first raised, of course, in the State habeas proceedings."
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,470.301,472.332,But not at the time of the trial?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,472.332,473.351,"No, not at the time of the trial."
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,476.45,478.5,How about on appeal?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,478.5,480.359,"On first appeal there was no issue, either."
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,498.717,506.494,How long after the original conviction and trial was the collateral proceeding in which this issue was first raised?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,506.494,513.53,"I believe the collateral proceeding at which this was first raised would have been in about 1972 or 3, and I'm sure counsel will correct me if I'm wrong."
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,513.53,514.539,Some years after?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,514.539,516.634,"It was some years after, no question about that."
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,521.852,524.576,Wasn't a re-appeal granted?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,524.576,525.314,That's correct.
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.314,527.836,Which coincided with the appeal in the habeas.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,527.836,528.494,That is correct.
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,564.985,582.68,"Before you leave it, the first action of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania would vindicate the judgment of the trial counsel that this case -- or give some vindication to the notion that it was not necessary to put on any evidence."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,582.68,591.288,"There is no question; as matter of fact, the Third Circuit even noted that had independent counsel made every decision that was made in this case, they would have little trouble finding effective assistance."
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,661.698,667.898,"Mr. Goldblatt, you said earlier in your argument, the record wasn't clear as to who paid the lawyers."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,675.456,681.391,"There's not even a clear indication of that because what happens is, there was some testimony -- and again --"
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,681.391,685.585,"Isn't that, though, what the Third Circuit and the District judges assumed?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,686.174,687.304,The Third Circuit assumed that.
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,694.356,703.21,"Well, if the Third Circuit made that factual assumption for the purposes of its decision, and if you haven't questioned that, shouldn't we assume that to be the fact for our decision?I don't know if it makes any difference."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,703.21,704.727,"No, that's argument three."
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.235,746.081,"It seems to me the legal issue might be a little different if you say a man being represented by counsel for two codefendants who are paying the lawyer, conceivably you'd have a little different standard than one where there isn't that factual situation."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,747.005,747.958,You may or you may not.
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,760.917,767.812,But was it at least clear that Sullivan did not pay for his own lawyer?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,768.568,770.954,There is that testimony from Sullivan.
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.359,778.102,But there's no contrary testimony either?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,778.102,778.158,No.
1979.78-1832,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.158,779.467,It's unrebutted testimony.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.467,782.688,"And it's also clear, isn't it, that these lawyers were retained lawyers?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,783.705,786.158,Absolutely clear; there was no court appointment in this case.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.158,793.077,"So presumably they weren't working for nothing, and if Sullivan didn't pay for them, somebody did."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,793.077,798.661,There was some indication actually in the record that perhaps they were working for nothing.
1979.78-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.661,803.404,Certainly the Court didn't have to believe a quote interested statement of Sullivan on the point.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,803.404,803.949,Certainly not.
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.946,847.705,"Did not Mr. Peruto, on some of the disputed items, say that he would defer to DiBona's recollection?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,847.705,848.844,He most certainly did.
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,848.844,854.024,"And that DiBona was the lead counsel, and he made the decisions?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,854.024,855.219,That is correct.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.116,996.996,Can I ask one more question before you go to the other issue?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,999.852,1000.426,Carchidi.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.426,1001.073,And DiPasquale.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1001.073,1002.551,DiPasquale.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.551,1003.963,Did they take the stand?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1003.963,1006.183,Carchidi did testify at his trial.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.183,1007.378,How about DiPasquale?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1007.378,1009.54,"DiPasquale, I believe, never got that far."
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.359,1027.638,And what witnesses testified for the defense in Carchidi's trial other than Carchidi?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1027.904,1035.852,"Interestingly enough, at page 183 of the Appendix, Judge DiBona testified that only one civilian witness testified at the Carchidi trial."
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1035.852,1037.441,Is that the other janitor?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1037.441,1040.635,"That was Michael Hessian, and he was called by the Commonwealth."
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.635,1043.395,And so they did not put any defense in at Carchidi's trial?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1043.598,1044.325,There was a defense.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.565,1070.011,"Well, the thing I don't quite under-stand, if there were police officers put on the stand by the defense in the Carchidi trial -- presumably, they gave helpful testimony, or at least, testimony they thought would helpful --"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1070.011,1072.927,They did not know of that testimony at the time of the Sullivan trial.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.927,1073.781,They didn't know about it.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1073.781,1075.301,They didn't know about it when that was litigated.
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.634,1085.25,"You mean, the only tactical decision was whether to put on Sullivan himself?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1085.25,1086.307,There was that tactical decision --
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.307,1088.414,That isn't the impression I got from the opinion.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1088.414,1094.918,"Well, the Third Circuit opinion -- again, this is what we argued -- there's an argument that there were three witnesses outside the union building."
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.671,1149.447,"It's a puzzling case, because I remember -- as I remember, Peruto did testify that one of the facts in their minds was the fact that if they did put on some other witnesses, that might prejudice the trials in the other two cases."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1149.447,1150.036,That's correct.
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1176.174,1178.623,Did the lead counsel agree with Mr. Peruto?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1178.623,1181.311,"No, the lead counsel most certainly did not agree with Mr. Peruto."
1979.78-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.832,1284.342,"On that basis, there wouldn't be any State action if some State presented perjured testimony unknowingly."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1284.342,1290.024,"No, because when I think you would get into a question of the State being the operating force for doing it."
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.162,1292.168,"Well, there's nothing they can do about it."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1292.168,1304.812,"All we're saying here, Mr. Justice White is that where there's an actual conflict, then the State apparatus is automatically implicated, regardless of whether the Judge knew about it or the prosecutor."
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.832,1321.679,"Well, suppose a lawyer representing a defendant just hires out to somebody else?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1333.845,1336.499,That's actual conflict.
1979.78-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1352.173,1356.238,"Well, what's the State action in my example?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1356.238,1362.663,"In that example where you have actually shown a conflict of interest existed, you have a denial of a fundamentally fair trial, number one."
1979.78-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.663,1365.31,"Yes, but not by the -- just by the fact that the State has convicted him?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1365.31,1366.992,"Just by virtue, the State has convicted him."
1979.78-1832,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.992,1368.292,The State has convicted him.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1368.292,1373.982,"And that is the state of -- as it is applied in the Fifth Circuit where they say, where there's actual conflict, it's automatically implicated."
1979.78-1832,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.982,1377.232,"Well, and what about a possibility of conflict?"
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1377.232,1383.157,"What I'm suggesting is, where you're talking about the possibility of conflict, however remote, that is not enough."
1979.78-1832,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1397.886,1403.084,"Mr. Goldblatt, in both cases the State's action is precisely the same."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1411.835,1415.329,"You will, firstly, of course have the State machinery implicated in every criminal case."
1979.78-1832,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1415.329,1415.614,Yes.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1415.614,1416.876,It will be there in any case.
1979.78-1832,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1416.876,1424.671,But your test of State action turns on the seriousness or the character of the constitutional -- or the alleged constitutional violation.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1424.671,1428.817,It's not so much the seriousness or the character of it; it's the degree of proof.
1979.78-1832,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1440.905,1450.094,"It was something which took place without the knowledge of any officer of the State, without the knowledge of the prosecutor or the judge, and without any duty to inquire, if I understand your facts."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1450.094,1453.326,"No, what I'm saying is, if in fact you've shown that it is something that took place --"
1979.78-1832,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1453.326,1465.416,"Well, Mr. Justice White's example, that you assume Mister -- one of these two lawyers was paid a large sum of money by the union to railroad the first defendant and get the two -- other two off, something like that."
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1468.942,1478.143,"All I'm saying is if -- what I'm saying, to analogize to this case, what I'm arguing is, if you come in and you prove that somebody was paid off, there is State action."
1979.78-1832,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1480.019,1480.986,By a private party.
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1480.986,1482.199,By a private party.
1979.78-1832,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1482.199,1484.316,What's the State action?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1484.316,1487.587,The State action is that implication of the State machinery in the process.
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1502.673,1504.676,Why get into the matter of State action?
1979.78-1832,0,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,1513.182,1515.692,It would become immaterial in that sense.
1979.78-1832,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1525.489,1528.444,Very well.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1530.998,1533.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1832,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1555.006,1558.018,"Well, that isn't what was decided below."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1558.018,1562.019,The Third Circuit proceeded just to apply its standard --
1979.78-1832,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1562.019,1562.89,"Well, I know."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1568.964,1573.531,"Sir, I would like to take a few moments at this time to review the procedural history."
1979.78-1832,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1573.681,1575.549,"Well, just tell me -- just tell me --"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1575.549,1577.064,And that's what I think answers the question.
1979.78-1832,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1577.064,1582.536,-- just tell me what basis did the Third Circuit use to set aside these convictions.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1582.536,1583.831,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1587.063,1590.134,"Did it say, actual conflict, or a possibility of conflict?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1590.134,1592.368,The Third Circuit referred to conflict.
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1592.368,1595.704,"Possibility, however remote."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1595.704,1602.869,"That is the standard that the Third Circuit has enunciated in the past, and that it applied to the facts of this case."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1602.869,1608.838,"Well, then, it did not find -- how can you say it found an actual conflict, if that's the standard it applied?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1608.838,1610.496,In several respects.
1979.78-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.269,1650.487,"Well, would you say that we are entitled, here, to judge the case on -- by the standard of actual conflict?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1651.95,1657.589,I would say that that is what the Third Circuit did in this case.
1979.78-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.589,1658.333,"Well, so we should --"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1658.333,1659.848,And the Third Circuit did it --
1979.78-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.848,1663.748,-- we should judge this case by that standard?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1663.748,1670.545,"No, sir, because I think that the Third Circuit's enunciated standard is a good standard."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.764,1693.25,What do you have to say about DiBona's testimony?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1693.25,1704.663,"I'd like to say, sir, of DiBona's testimony that he testified that he and Peruto were co-counsel in this case."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.384,1773.364,If one was to believe --
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1773.364,1774.068,Could I --
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1774.068,1778.819,If one was to believe Judge DiBona's testimony -- Mr. DiBona at that time --
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1778.819,1780.049,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.049,1784.278,-- what's the basis for the Third Circuit's conclusions?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1784.278,1797.993,"The basis is that Mr. Peruto, who also represented Mr. Sullivan, was co-counsel with Mr. DiBona; that the two of them had ongoing responsibilities to the other two."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1797.993,1810.1,"Mr. Peruto testified that wherever his testimony was different from that of DiBona, he would defer to Mr. DiBona because he was lead counsel."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1810.1,1822.861,"Well, sir, Mr. Peruto was being deferential to Mr. DiBona because Mr. DiBona was at that time, the time of post-conviction proceedings, Judge DiBona, and Mr. Peruto had to appear before him many times."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.786,1836.412,Judge DiBona's testimony was that he urged Sullivan to take the stand.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1836.412,1838.306,"Yes, sir, that was his testimony."
1979.78-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.306,1845.057,"Well, Ms. Gelb, we do have a cold record here, as the Third Circuit also did."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,1904.097,1924.575,"I take the Third Circuit to have examined the precise procedural history of this case, and to have concluded that the factual underpinnings supported this conclusion of law that there was, number one, dual representation, and number two, a conflict of interest, or at least a possibility for a conflict of interest."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2088.234,2091.85,"The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on December 29, 1971."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2091.85,2093.07,"1971, sir, that's right."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2093.07,2096.208,And that appeal was never argued; is that correct?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2096.208,2097.259,"That's correct, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.259,2099.527,And there's some question about whether or not a brief was ever filed?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2099.527,2101.132,There is a very strong question.
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2103.794,2105.595,"There's no issue here, I know."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2105.595,2106.034,That's right; it is not.
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2106.034,2108.453,"But in any event, that appeal was never argued."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2110.212,2115.241,"That's correct, sir, 3-3, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, on December 29, 1971."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.241,2117.084,Does that mean there was no opinion?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2117.084,2121.066,"There was an opinion, but the opinion had nothing whatever to do with conflict of interest."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.927,2126.436,They were --
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2126.436,2127.292,They were -- the --
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2127.292,2128.636,We don't know if there was a brief.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2131.623,2131.949,That's correct.
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.949,2132.342,"And if there was no brief, they certainly were never raised."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2132.342,2134.888,"The same counsel filed the appeal, you see."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2134.951,2137.051,"And when did the case get back to that court, then?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2137.051,2148.393,"The case got back to that Court, interestingly enough, Mr. Chief Justice, following post-conviction proceedings, where we argued in those proceedings the denial of a right to appeal."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2157.424,2159.089,On appeal.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2159.089,2160.525,"The appellate rights, that's right."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2163.07,2165.394,"Did they raise the conflicts, then?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2165.394,2167.605,"At that time, yes, I did raise the conflict question."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2167.605,2169.314,"In the this post-conviction, the one you're just talking about."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2169.314,2170.339,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2173.538,2178.952,Is that the first time the State of Pennsylvania was made aware of this problem?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2178.952,2180.28,The problem of conflict?
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.28,2181.66,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2181.66,2184.35,Our position is that it is not the first time.
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.511,2192.673,"Well, when was it asserted?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2192.673,2200.169,"However, it was actually asserted by counsel -- by counsel other than DiBona and Peruto -- in post-conviction proceedings."
1979.78-1832,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.045,2223.615,"But am I not correct that the second time before the Court was also a direct appeal by leave of court, as well as on habeas?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2223.615,2227.696,"The second time, sir -- yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1832,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.553,2235.085,"Yes, so that --"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2235.085,2241.624,"And at that time, under Pennsylvania law, the other issues then were undecided."
1979.78-1832,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.624,2246.134,So that at least this question was raised on direct appeal on the merits.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2246.134,2251.536,"The question of a conflict was raised before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on direct appeal on the merits; it was, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.536,2255.065,"What year was that, '72, by the time it got back there the second time?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2256.327,2257.309,"'75, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2257.309,2258.015,'75?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2258.015,2259.193,That's right.
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2259.568,2269.742,"The first time the State of Pennsylvania knew about the conflict claim, it was in 1975, eight years after the conviction."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2269.742,2272.701,"That was the first time the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania knew about it, yes."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2279.15,2279.346,And then what happened --
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2279.346,2281.278,And that was the first time the issue was raised.
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2281.278,2285.483,"When it was back on the second direct appeal, what was the result?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2285.483,2305.18,"The result there was a 5-2 decision, first of all the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that it was proper to proceed in this matter, and that the lower court was correct in permitting an appeal to be taken on the ineffective assistance in the appellate process issues; and then proceeded to decide adversely to Sullivan on the merits of the case."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2347.681,2350.855,"Well, didn't Mr. Peruto say that himself?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2350.855,2352.01,He did not say that himself.
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2352.01,2355.188,Because he had deferred to Mr. DiBona.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2355.188,2362.351,"Yes, he was deferring to Judge DiBona's recollection, because DiBona -- Judge DiBona had testified earlier in the post-conviction proceedings."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2362.351,2365.976,"And he said he deferred because DiBona was lead counsel, did he not?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2365.976,2367.934,"Yes, sir; he did say that."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2368.394,2374.708,"So that as between the two counsel, they thought that there was a lead counsel and a co-counsel."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2374.708,2383.644,"Interestingly enough, in the perception of counsel, Judge DiBona also said that he was lead counsel in the Carchidi case at that time."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2389.996,2392.575,"Mr. Peruto thought he was lead counsel in that case, didn't he?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2392.575,2396.621,"He was lead counsel in that case, sir, as he tried the case."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2456.49,2459.817,"Ms. Gelb, let me ask you a question about your kind of ultimate theory here."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2459.817,2460.079,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2460.079,2461.478,The possibility of a conflict.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2463.071,2463.548,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2463.548,2467.004,"Secondarily, you argue, the possibility of a conflict is enough, don't you?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2467.004,2467.49,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2467.49,2468.794,As the Third Circuit holds.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2492.716,2496.78,"I don't think it would have been the end of the matter, where you'd have an actual conflict, no, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2498.098,2500.771,But you'd then have to prove actual conflict if he did that.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2500.771,2501.546,That's right.
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2519.797,2521.252,What is your view of the conflict?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2528.575,2528.773,I do.
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.773,2530.637,-- that we don't know who those witnesses are or anything like that?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2530.637,2538.413,"I do disagree, and I will make an effort to go into the factual background, because I do think it's important in this case."
1979.78-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2648.18,2651.593,Weren't some of the three witnesses called by the prosecution?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2651.593,2651.902,What is it?
1979.78-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2651.902,2655.441,Weren't some of those three witnesses you're referring to called by the prosecution?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2655.441,2656.534,"No, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.433,2716.507,"Well, there's an explanation for that."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2729.034,2732.54,That's what Mr. Peruto said years later.
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2733.94,2737.362,"Well, then, all of this took place years later."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2737.362,2740.912,"Well, not the part about the witnesses outside the window at trial."
1979.78-1832,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2742.247,2747.48,"But the explanation took place years later, and so did all this business about the conflict took place years later, too."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2747.48,2748.048,That's right.
1979.78-1832,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2749.042,2749.304,Right; exactly.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2749.304,2750.95,-- this respondent could raise it.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2752.116,2758.405,"My brother Stevens point about -- I guess you'd call it the state action point, or whatever it is?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2758.405,2760.747,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2760.747,2763.203,How does the state get in this?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2771.987,2786.229,"Well, if what you're saying, sir, is that you don't see the difference between retained or appointed counsel, I would agree that there should be no distinctions made between retained and appointment counsel."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2787.534,2802.163,My question is Where do you get the right for the State to be required to give you separate lawyers when there is a conflict of interest?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2802.163,2806.571,Because I think that's necessary corollary of Sixth Amendment effectiveness.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2806.571,2810.767,"Well, what about the right to pick your own lawyer?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2814.864,2818.697,"Yes, sir, you do have a right to pick your own lawyer, even if he is a jackass."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.313,2823.364,Aren't you saying that you don't have that right?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2823.364,2823.645,"No, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2823.645,2827.197,That the state must come in and give you another lawyer?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2827.197,2828.214,"No, sir, I'm not saying --"
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2828.214,2831.152,"Well, what are you -- that's what I'm trying to get at What are you saying?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2831.152,2832.296,Yes.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2856.331,2861.04,How do you know what where you got one man on trial?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2861.04,2870.821,"Because, in this case, this respondent wanted to take the witness stand, wanted witnesses called for him --"
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2870.821,2879.253,"Well, when do you say the state should have moved in and appointed counsel for him?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2879.253,2884.259,This respondent didn't know that it was disadvantaged.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2884.36,2885.931,"Well, how did the court know?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2885.931,2886.803,Because --
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2886.803,2887.658,"If nobody -- well, who did know?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2887.658,2889.979,Because the trial judge in this case --
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2889.979,2890.962,Yes.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2890.962,2899.295,-- at least at one juncture in this case said to the lawyers that he was tired of trying to get discovery for the other clients.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2907.551,2911.341,What should the judge have done at that stage?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2911.341,2911.965,What is it?
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.965,2916.906,What should the trial judge have done?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2916.906,2926.629,"At least inquire of the defendant whether he understood that he had a right to conflict-free counsel, where initially, there were three defendants --"
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2926.629,2928.854,Appointed by the court?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2928.854,2930.58,Not necessarily appointed by the court.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2938.031,2941.599,"Well, what about the attorney-client privilege?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2941.599,2955.381,"Sir, I think that the extent of the inquiry that could be conducted between a judge and a defendant before him is, in fact, limited by attorney-client privilege."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2983.692,2990.517,"I think that Mr. Sullivan would say, ""Judge, I don't have to answer that question, because it's none of your business."""
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,2990.517,2991.679,I think you're right sir.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.053,2996.216,"""I have a point -- I have hired a counsel."
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3001.451,3002.106,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3002.106,3005.192,Isn't that our American system?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3005.192,3007.218,"Well, yes, sir, I think it is our American system."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.375,3012.747,"Well, what is the system -- what is the system where you can't have our own lawyer?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3012.747,3018.792,"Well, this isn't question of whether Sullivan could or couldn't have his own lawyer."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3027.038,3028.355,They didn't threaten him?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3028.355,3029.385,No; he agreed.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3029.61,3030.096,He agreed.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3030.096,3031.092,It was voluntary.
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.353,3035.775,It could be that you don't look a gift horse in the mouth?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3035.775,3038.607,"It could be, yes."
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.67,3042.647,"But the judge didn't know that, did he?"
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3042.647,3043.592,Didn't know that --
1979.78-1832,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.592,3046.214,The judge assumed that that was retained counsel?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3046.214,3050.614,"I think that's correct, sir; I don't know from the record, but I think that's correct."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3088.721,3092.354,When did Mr. Peruto first tell about those things?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3092.354,3095.798,When he was subpoenaed to testify in post-conviction proceedings.
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3097.817,3102.374,How many years after the trial?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3104.95,3105.501,Seven years.
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3105.501,3106.417,Seven years.
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3106.417,3107.462,That's right.
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3121.904,3124.18,Did the Third Circuit do anything about it?
1979.78-1832,1,35924,marilyn_j_gelb,,3124.18,3126.353,"No, sir."
1979.78-1832,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.474,3167.188,Very well.
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3169.76,3174.739,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1832,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3239.281,3244.243,But do you think the Third Circuit thought it was propounding a constitutional standard?
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3246.229,3248.865,For evaluating the conflict question.
1979.78-1832,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3248.865,3250.129,Mere possibility.
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3250.129,3251.813,"A possibility of conflict, however remote, is there --"
1979.78-1832,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3251.813,3254.937,When did it first adopt that rule?
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3254.937,3260.4,"Nineteen -- Hart v. Davenport was the first case, and I believe it was 1972."
1979.78-1832,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3271.305,3273.933,"Well, when was the second appeal in the Pennsylvania court?"
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3273.933,3275.662,1977 it was decided.
1979.78-1832,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3275.662,3282.181,The Hart case involved -- at least according to Judge Garth as I understood his dissenting opinion -- the Hart case involved joint representation.
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3282.181,3282.957,Joint representation.
1979.78-1832,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3289.029,3289.59,Right.
1979.78-1832,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.59,3291.707,"Well, was he--"
1979.78-1832,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3291.707,3292.177,He was in dissent.
1979.78-1832,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.177,3294.322,He was in dissent.
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3308.816,3309.811,That is correct.
1979.78-1832,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3311.991,3315.491,And was that -- and about the same Federal constitutional issue.
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3318.573,3319.177,That's right.
1979.78-1832,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3319.177,3326.368,And was the Third Circuit standard urged upon the Pennsylvania Supreme Court?
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3326.368,3328.474,"No, it was not."
1979.78-1832,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3333.335,3335.486,So they used the actual conflict standard?
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3335.486,3338.223,What they did was -- it's very tricky language -- I'm not --
1979.78-1832,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3338.223,3340.564,But they did decide there was no conflict?
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3340.564,3341.22,"Yes, that is correct."
1979.78-1832,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3375.576,3380.028,"Well, they might have found something else; but they certainly found that."
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3380.028,3381.087,That is correct.
1979.78-1832,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.729,3414.504,"Well, in Holloway, the defense counsel protested to the court."
1979.78-1832,2,41365,steven_h_goldblatt,,3414.504,3415.245,That's what I'm saying.
1979.78-1832,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3430.508,3431.184,"Thank you, counsel."
