2003.02-10038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.135,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-10038, Robert James Tennard v. Doug Dretke."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,8.916,12.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-10038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,25.429,29.887,"Mr. Owen, am I correct in thinking that Smith's case is no longer before us?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,29.887,30.63,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,30.63,31.335,Thank you.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,31.335,35.012,This Court in Penry held that the deliberateness question--
2003.02-10038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,35.012,37.158,May I ask another preliminary question?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,47.476,51.026,"--That is in the questions presented, Your Honor, and--"
2003.02-10038,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,51.026,62.254,"Because you seem to be asking us to grant habeas relief, and I would have thought what we had to consider was the denial of the certificate of appealability."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,62.997,64.279,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,77.365,81.989,"Well, that's... that's true of all certificate of... of appealability cases, isn't it?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,81.989,82.732,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,101.514,107.42,"Well, as long as we're into these preliminary matters... and then I'll let you, so far as I'm concerned, proceed the way you wish."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,119.968,122.03,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.382,203.521,"May I ask you, Mr. Owen?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,223.705,226.305,"There is no Atkins claim before this Court, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,310.723,331.445,"But do I understand that the... that the specific issue that we've got here, assuming we... we do reach the... the merits issue as part of the COA problem, is the specific circuit rule that there has got to be a finding of, as I recall, unique severity and a finding of causation."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,347.67,348.142,Yes.
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.852,417.599,You say it doesn't have to be related to the... to the crime at all.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,417.599,418.592,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.592,421.48,"I mean, what... how... how can that be?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,427.88,429.532,I think--
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.532,439.276,"I guess that's a great handicap and... and you must feel sorry for the poor fellow, but what does it have to do with mitigating the fact that he murdered somebody?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,456.737,470.976,"--I think, Your Honor, that the... the wisdom of this Court's case in Lockett, the wisdom of the Lockett decision is that that judgment, the judgment that you're describing, is this in fact mitigating, does this support a life sentence as opposed to the death penalty--"
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.976,476.92,Suppose the defendant is despondent over global warming and... and that has nothing to do with... with the case.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,478.285,481.523,"--I think, Your Honor, that... that the jury is the person--"
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.523,482.25,"I mean, there are no limits?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,482.25,488.954,"--There... there shouldn't be any limits on admission, Your Honor, or on the jury's ability to give that evidence effect if it chooses to do so."
2003.02-10038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.724,496.346,"This evidence was admitted, was it not?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,496.346,497.089,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,497.711,499.568,So we're not talking evidence that was excluded.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,503.405,524.915,"--That's correct, Your Honor, although I should point out that to the extent that the lower courts have, from time to time, described these threshold rules, the nexus requirement, the severity requirement, as relevance rules, rules of constitutional relevance, it at least holds out the possibility that in a future case a court might choose to exclude evidence as irrelevant to punishment."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.915,529.206,"Are there... are there any other areas where... where we just say, you know, there... there are no rules at all."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,546.091,558.684,"I certainly think, Your Honor, that suggesting that the jury could respond simply out of sympathy or emotion or an unfocused passion is precluded by the Court's cases, and the Court has approved any number of--"
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.684,558.767,Right.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,560.708,561.618,--I think that what you tell them--
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.618,563.93,Don't you have to tell them what the Fifth Circuit suggests?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,580.194,580.953,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,591.544,602.772,"Well, are you saying that in... in most States under Lockett, the trial judge has no discretion to say this is just too far outside the bounds of what mitigation evidence really means?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,602.772,607.396,I think that the bounds that Lockett sets are clear enough to... to preclude some facts.
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.66,642.896,"What about... what about the other... the other factor that you say the Fifth Circuit shouldn't have taken into account, that is, severity of the... of the factor that the defendant claims mitigates?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,647.52,648.347,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.347,653.836,"So he can... he can tell the jury, you know, I had a really bad cold that day."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,653.836,656.437,"Let... let me say, Your Honor, that when... that when the Court said--"
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.437,664.693,"Is it seriously we... we have to let the jury just ponder over that question, whether the fact that he had a really bad cold--"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,664.693,666.801,--I think the Court could be confident--
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.801,667.022,--should mitigate his crime?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,667.022,676.46,--the jury would not ponder very long over the question whether a serious cold meaningfully reduced the defendant's culpability in a way that made a life sentence appropriate.
2003.02-10038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.46,687.522,"No, but by the same token, wouldn't it be fair for the judge to say, no reasonable jury, possessed of reasonable, human sympathy, could possibly find this mitigating?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,692.185,706.197,"I think, Your Honor, that if no reasonable juror could possibly accord the evidence any significance to the ultimate sentencing decision, then it would be consistent with Lockett because Lockett does comprehend facts about the--"
2003.02-10038,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.197,708.033,Okay. But you're... you're worried about the other end of the spectrum.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,708.033,708.881,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,712.884,713.084,The circuit... isn't--
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,713.084,713.706,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,713.706,729.681,"--The... the question about what is a mitigating circumstance would come up under Texas' current instruction 2, the instruction that says that you can consider all the mitigating evidence, consider all the mitigating evidence."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,738.885,739.916,"That's right, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.114,751.479,Why is it higher than mitigating evidence?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,765.141,765.884,--No.
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.544,767.082,"Oh, that isn't the reason."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,767.082,768.568,"--not because it was not severe enough, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.651,768.817,I see.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,772.366,797.508,"Because I do think that... that Lockett anticipates that there are facts about the defendant's character and background which, according to tradition, according to our understanding of what constitutes an appropriate basis for extending leniency, which does not limit itself to evidence that has a nexus with the crime, that... that there would be room for a judge to say, in an extreme case... and I'm not saying this would be a routine judgment."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.702,803.824,Do you want to tell me why?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,825.993,832.038,--Because I don't think there's any dimension on... in which it is relevant to whether the defendant deserves a life sentence or the death penalty.
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.038,835.632,It's not relevant because of what?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,835.632,838.454,It's not relevant because it doesn't reflect any--
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.454,841.305,"Because... because colds don't count or, you know, what?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,841.305,841.609,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.518,851.889,"I suggest that... that the reason you feel it's... it's not relevant is because either it's too insignificant or it has no relation whatever to the act that he committed, one or the other of those."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,852.26,865.469,"--Well, I think that... that if the Court's... let me back up and say that in any number of cases, this Court has recognized as mitigating circumstances which have no causal connection to the crime."
2003.02-10038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,903.159,910.878,"Mr.... Mr. Owen, is this position of the... the severity and the nexus peculiar to the pre-1991 sentences?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,919.134,942.13,"--No, Your Honor, and... and given this Court's very clear approval of the new statute in Penry II where this Court observed in passing that this new statute and its broad opportunity for the jury to consider mitigation was a clearly drafted, catchall provision that complies with Penry I, I don't anticipate that there could be a challenge raised under the new statute."
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.879,961.858,May I ask you a... a question about the operation of the Texas rule?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,968.712,969.289,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.958,973.254,You mean under the Texas rule it would come in?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,973.254,982.846,"Yes, Your Honor, because the nexus... the nexus... the nexus rule or principle or framework is a... is a... an appellate review doctrine."
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1017.465,1021.551,"Well, what... what is wrong with the nexus requirement then if it doesn't keep the evidence out?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1021.551,1043.593,"Because it denies the defendant the opportunity to have the jury... it refuses to... to allow a new sentencing hearing for a defendant who comes to the appellate court and says, at the time that I was sentenced, I presented evidence that was clearly relevant to my culpability, like a 67 IQ, and yet the jury wasn't instructed in such a way that they could give it effect."
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.79,1054.866,So what's the rationale for the nexus rule?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1060.106,1060.577,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.935,1094.536,"Of course, in this case... and I guess in all... all of the cases involving the... the old Texas instruction, the State court was proceeding not under Penry II, but just under Penry I."
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1123.347,1127.328,"Actually, Your Honor, Penry I does say full consideration."
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.582,1257.965,"May I ask you, how... how does the Texas nexus rule work with evidence that the defendant had a war record?"
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1269.149,1271.173,"That evidence... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.173,1273.607,What happens under... in Texas with kind of evidence?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1273.607,1284.343,I think that what the... what the court would say is that you don't have to get to the question of whether he showed a nexus because that's the kind of evidence that has a natural home in the future dangerousness question.
2003.02-10038,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.343,1286.943,Why does that have anything to do with future dangerousness?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1288.019,1291.856,"Your Honor, I believe what the... I believe what Texas would say... and I'm not saying... this is my view."
2003.02-10038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.413,1310.615,Or... or that he might revert back to his good character in a way that someone who had never shown it might not.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1310.615,1311.525,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1363.909,1369.892,Would anything do short of the catchall that Texas has had since 1991?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1381.409,1396.52,"In Penry, this Court suggested that it might be possible to define the term... let me back up and say, remember, there's a... the first special issue asks the jury whether the defendant killed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would result."
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.095,1440.154,I'm... I'm a little puzzled about why you... you're not asserting that this defendant was retarded.
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1452.952,1453.861,This Court in--
2003.02-10038,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1453.861,1456.379,And... and we should... that has to be taken into account by the jury?
2003.02-10038,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1456.379,1468.556,"--This Court in Bell v. Ohio, the companion case to Lockett, said that Bell's low average intelligence, or dull, normal intelligence, was a mitigating factor that the sentencer had to be allowed to consider."
2003.02-10038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.537,1512.024,"Very well, Mr. Owen."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1513.76,1522.555,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-10038,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1552.414,1565.28,"Well, it seems to me this... this is not a case of... of ineffective assistance of counsel where we're seeing if... if it was proper to overlook the evidence at all."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1571.595,1574.567,"--Your Honor, I... I believe it was given proper consideration."
2003.02-10038,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1577.334,1582.535,"Well, but I mean, that's... that's quite apart from the fact that, you know, it may be persuasive or not persuasive."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1582.535,1584.598,"--It is apart from that question, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.863,1681.155,"Opposing counsel says, however, we don't even have to get to that argument, that maybe if the Fifth Circuit had considered the case aright, it would agree with you on that point."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1694.901,1702.536,"Justice Scalia, I... I would say that the Fifth Circuit was really looking at whether the State court's opinion was reasonable in this case."
2003.02-10038,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1714.053,1727.306,"Well, do you... do you think the Fifth Circuit's uniquely severe, permanent handicap and nexus tests are the proper interpretation of the Penry cases?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1727.306,1730.937,"I believe, Justice O'Connor, that they are one proper interpretation."
2003.02-10038,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.019,1752.114,"I mean, if we thought that the certificate of appealability should have been granted, I suppose you would then argue, when it went back, that those are the right tests to employ?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1752.114,1754.593,"--That would be one argument we would advance, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-10038,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1764.457,1775.685,"I... I have a lot of trouble seeing how the first uniquely severe, permanent handicap test is... is proper in light of Penry."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1781.052,1783.858,We know now that it's a low IQ.
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1911.23,1912.966,All right. Could I... can I... can I interrupt you there?
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1964.895,1968.898,"Justice Souter, that is not a question of admissibility, though."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.788,1981.037,"No, but it... it... as your brother on the other side said, if it's constitutional relevance, it could be a basis for an admissibility ruling."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2011.419,2015.384,"--Your Honor, it's... it's a combination question that we're looking at here."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2022.565,2036.189,"But you say... but as I understand it, the circuit and the Court of Criminal Appeals says we don't even have to deal with the substance of these issues unless the evidence is indicative of something which is uniquely severe, which clearly this is not."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2056.456,2058.275,"--Your Honor, that may be true."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2059.351,2061.619,"Well, if it's true, it's a violation of Penry, isn't it?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2061.619,2062.733,"--I... I disagree, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2075.531,2076.645,I think you're wrong about that.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2093.569,2094.395,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2108.968,2110.742,"--It's the same test, isn't it?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2110.742,2112.228,"--Not quite, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2173.157,2186.16,"But what is the State... I thought that at one point you told us that... that the Fifth Circuit got the severity and nexus threshold requirements from the State, that the State initiated those requirements."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2193.219,2210.103,"--Your Honor, the State court initially began by asking... by identifying more or less four factors, whether the... whether the evidence was involuntary disability, whether it was permanent in nature, whether it was severe enough, and whether there was at least an inference of nexus from the evidence."
2003.02-10038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2255.967,2264.429,"But you... you seem to... what you said were... you recited four factors, but it sounded like severity was one and nexus was another."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2264.429,2265.915,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is correct."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2268.782,2271.199,You say it has not been applied as a causation test.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2274.832,2277.598,"That is a fair statement of it, Justice Souter."
2003.02-10038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.654,2281.973,--I'm rather mixed up.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2344.267,2346.497,"I think that's the brief in Smith, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.497,2347.983,That's the brief in Smith.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2353.722,2358.469,"Justice Breyer, the... the evidence is an interesting contrast between the two cases."
2003.02-10038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.958,2396.735,"When you say no idea what kind of a test, it was recognized it was an IQ test, wasn't it?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2396.735,2398.017,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.624,2413.082,Isn't that something the State would know if it were given in a State prison?
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2422.741,2430.709,"Your Honor, it was not contained on the... the social and criminal history form that was introduce, and that's at page 63 of the joint appendix."
2003.02-10038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.111,2446.313,"But somebody connected with the State correction system would know, would they not?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2446.313,2447.799,Presumably someone would know.
2003.02-10038,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2450.855,2457.375,"Well, the State could have informed itself fully of what goes on at State prisons with regard to IQ tests."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2457.375,2460.802,"That's possible, Your Honor, except that it was the defendant's evidence in this case."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2468.771,2484.125,"But all of this goes to the weight that the evidence might have, but it... what... what does it have to do with whether it is appropriate to erect this threshold test for considering whether it even needs to be considered as... as an issue on appeal?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2484.125,2497.023,"Justice Souter, under... under both Graham and Johnson, we're trying to figure out whether the evidence had some relevance within the special issues, not whether it had every bit of relevance it should have had, but whether it just had some meaningful relevance."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2505.096,2510.769,"No, but it... it... you... you don't... I take it your argument is not that they couldn't give it any weight at all."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2510.769,2512.072,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2512.072,2531.102,"So the... the... what I'm going to call the screening question we have before us is does a Court even have to get into the use that might be made of that evidence, whatever its weight, unless that evidence satisfies these two threshold requirements--"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2531.102,2532.3,"Your Honor, those threshold--"
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2532.3,2534.862,--or the State's equivalent of the two threshold requirements?
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2536.387,2546.046,"--I believe that is the issue, and I might add that those threshold requirements are questions as to what relevance the evidence had and how it could have fit within the special issues."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2555.334,2579.854,"But the... the circuit, I take it, would say, all right, given the fact that there may be an argument over the weight to be given, accepting that, we don't have to decide whether enough weight could be given to that evidence for Penry purposes unless that evidence indicates something that is uniquely severe and was the cause of the crime."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2579.854,2611.062,"Generally speaking, Justice Souter, the evidence that fails to pass that test does have some relevance within the special issues because, generally speaking, it tends to either show that the crime was an aberration... what we're looking for is something that's... when we're trying to identify Penry error, we're looking at evidence that's solely aggravating in answering those special issues, not necessarily evidence that just has some relevance outside those special issues, just whether it has only aggravating relevance within them or no relevance within them."
2003.02-10038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2641.405,2642.269,Can I--
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.269,2643.012,--You're saying--
2003.02-10038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2643.012,2653.952,"--procedurally I... I see what... what we have in... in your case is it's... there's a reference to lower court in your brief, and I'm not sure which it is."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2684.129,2684.722,That's correct.
2003.02-10038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2686.291,2690.173,So what you've done is you got rid of the other case which did clearly present it.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2690.173,2690.832,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2690.832,2694.919,And now what you're saying now is this case doesn't really present the issue that we took it to deal with.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2694.919,2695.208,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2699.173,2700.697,"Now, what do you suggest we do?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2717.06,2725.688,"--Well, Your Honor, contrary... I mean, and in contrast to Penry and the prior cases that came before the Court, this is not here on de novo review."
2003.02-10038,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.02,2757.063,"What about saying we've seen in other cases like Smith, for example, that the Fifth Circuit has continuously denied review or reversed or affirmed or whatever on the basis of these two tests?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2774.44,2787.277,"--Your Honor, I think that again, if the Court disagrees with the test that was applied in the Fifth Circuit, the Court is still stuck with... with determining whether it was the State court's opinion that was reasonable or not."
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.793,2831.532,Could... could I get back to what you had just said before Justice Breyer asked you the question?
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2865.917,2867.403,"--Generally speaking, yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2867.403,2867.486,Okay.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2876.281,2890.686,"We're... in trying to... in trying to analyze the... the Penry claim, we're trying to figure out whether... whether the evidence introduced at trial had... had significant relevance to moral culpability that was outside the scope of the special issues."
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.86,2908.519,All right.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2929.613,2944.556,"Well, for example, Justice Scalia, I... I think that the evidence of follower status, for example, that... that was argued extensively to the jury in this case would have a nexus to the crime because, of course, it involved the circumstances of the crime."
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.477,2964.619,"Yes, but I mean it... it accidentally had a nexus to the crime because, you know, he claimed that he was a follower in this crime."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2973.247,2974.734,"Well, then I think--"
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.734,2979.479,Why do you need the nexus in order to make it considerable by the jury?
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2979.479,2987.215,"--Well, then I would question whether the evidence actually had relevance to moral culpability if it had no connection to the defendant or his crime."
2003.02-10038,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3019.211,3020.425,Would you clarify one thing for me?
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3028.499,3034.898,"It... it requires a nexus, at least an inferential nexus, to the crime itself, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.898,3045.012,"Well, then... then I take it being a veteran or a war hero or something like that, which clearly had nothing to do with this particular crime... that would not be... not satisfy the nexus requirement."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3045.012,3050.956,"It would not, but it... but... but again, that evidence would be relevance within future dangerousness because it would go to good character."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3063.216,3068.789,All right. What... what about the... the case of the individual with the... with the abused childhood?
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3106.684,3108.253,"--The rule is not that strict, Justice Souter."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3111.885,3114.28,"Well, I mean, that's... that's what I mean by cause."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3116.881,3125.714,"--I think child abuse is... is truly analogous to youth, for example, which I think the average juror does understand has a connection to moral culpability."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3129.679,3130.067,No.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3156.922,3158.674,"--No, you're not wrong, Justice Souter."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3159.75,3161.275,Okay.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3178.986,3183.46,"--If child abuse was the evidence presented in this case, we may have a bigger problem, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3186.909,3189.221,"But it's utterly inconsistent with our cases, isn't it?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3193.308,3194.589,"It is, of course."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3194.589,3200.45,"And... and must be given we'll... let's use the term, meaningful consideration, by the jury."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3206.577,3207.963,"I don't think that's absolute, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3218.616,3219.07,Yes.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3251.968,3257.997,"--Your Honor, I... I'm not aware of cases that... that they excluded evidence of severe child abuse."
2003.02-10038,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.684,3265.343,That's the other factor.
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3268.028,3268.892,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3268.892,3277.992,"I... I guess that gets us... I guess the difference between your answer to Justice Scalia and your answer to me gets... gets us to the question, what do they mean by cause?"
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3293.002,3293.252,I--
2003.02-10038,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3293.252,3299.318,"I mean, your answer to Justice Scalia suggests that I... that I am wrong, that the circuit isn't requiring what I thought it was."
2003.02-10038,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,3299.318,3308.113,"--Your Honor, I think in Robertson, the most recent case in which the Court took up the issue of child abuse... and I see my red light is on, but I'll finish answering."
2003.02-10038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3308.113,3308.534,"Thank you, Mr. Marshall."
2003.02-10038,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3312.404,3314.633,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-10038,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3314.633,3322.313,"Mr. Owen, is your understanding the same as Mr. Marshall's that we're talking about a universe of 100 cases?"
2003.02-10038,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3322.313,3327.636,"I... I tried to count them myself, Your Honor, and my number was closer to 50."
2003.02-10038,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3475.795,3476.721,Was that argument made?
2003.02-10038,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3476.721,3488.344,"It is certainly argued, Your Honor, that... as defense counsel puts it to the jury, he says, you have a man who has an IQ that is that low, and he says to the jury, none of you know what it's like to have a 67 IQ."
2003.02-10038,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3594.93,3596.788,"Thank you, Mr. Owen."
