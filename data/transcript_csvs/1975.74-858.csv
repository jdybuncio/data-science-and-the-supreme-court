1975.74-858,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.975,We will hear arguments next in Carey against Randolph and the Curtis Circulation against Randolph.
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,59.798,64.337,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-858,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.125,391.501,"Verified complaint, isn’t it?"
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,396.022,407.208,"The gravament of the complaint was largely the same, but the complaint was broader and less detailed and did not go into the evidentiary facts to the same extent, the affidavit did."
1975.74-858,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,407.208,411.546,And the complaint was submitted to the judge along with the affidavit?
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,411.546,412.259,Yes.
1975.74-858,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.259,414.835,And you contend you have pocket process.
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,429.984,430.578,That is correct.
1975.74-858,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,464.208,472.834,"The issues here involve all three sub paragraphs four, five and eight of 6201."
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,472.984,474.8,"Yes, they do, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-858,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,479.449,481.804,Which is what fraud or the inception of contract?
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,481.804,486.75,The first one is fraudulent secretion of assets.
1975.74-858,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,496.358,497.847,Eight is an action for fraud or deceit.
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,497.847,504.751,That is correct.
1975.74-858,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,504.751,513.482,Was their any finding here that these assets would be wasted so as to the defendant would be judgment proof?
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,513.482,516.4,You mean a finding by a Court or what Curtis learned?
1975.74-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.064,723.519,"Suppose the New York Law permitted a seizure attachment prior to any notice or hearing and then provided and for, no hearing whatsoever after the attachment and prior final hearing and judgment on whether or not the attachment was proper, would you argue that that law was valid?"
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,723.519,729.193,If I understand your question absolutely no hearing between the ex parte taking and plenary trial.
1975.74-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.156,756.669,To do what?
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,756.669,764.365,For the defendant to come in and at least get the judges here to test what the plaintiff has told the judge.
1975.74-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.365,770.292,And that goes broader than whether or not there may be a danger of loosing the asset?
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,777.058,777.381,Yes.
1975.74-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.396,779.404,All right.
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,783.944,785.235,That is correct.
1975.74-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.064,816.226,"Now that you say that the New York Law -- As I understand the District Court it said that under the New York Law, it understood it, the opportunity for the defendant to make any showing between the ex parte attachment and the plenary trial related solely to the danger of loosing the asset."
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,816.226,818.854,"I am sorry, I misunderstood what you were asking me before."
1975.74-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.691,831.863,I will put it the other way then so that (Inaudible)
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,831.863,832.789,"Thank you, your Honor."
1975.74-858,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,843.12,846.591,Mr. Busner you may continue.
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,846.591,854.507,I would like to correct that impression I may have left by virtue of a question asked to me of Mr. Justice Blackmun earlier in the argument.
1975.74-858,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,898.415,919.932,"Perhaps, that is so (Inaudible) or plaintiffs have some merits?"
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,919.932,931.613,"As I read Mitchell and the North Georgia against Di-Chem, if that were the case, if the defendant were restricted to the question whether the security was necessary, I think the law would be unconstitutional but—"
1975.74-858,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,931.613,937.141,(Inaudible)
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,937.141,940.64,Absolutely and it is clear from the face of the statute.
1975.74-858,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,956.299,959.743,(Inaudible)
1975.74-858,0,37749,philip_h_busner,,959.743,964.416,"Quite obviously, and mostly egregious --"
1975.74-858,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,1523.866,1528.261,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-858,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.859,1946.797,You do not just hand the affidavit to the judge and he automatically signs it.
1975.74-858,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,1946.797,1947.856,Absolutely not.
1975.74-858,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2010.678,2015.529,"How often in your practice, have you ever had an application turned down?"
1975.74-858,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,2015.529,2019.134,I would say I have never made an application for writ of attachment.
1975.74-858,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2026.101,2027.032,(Voice Overlap)
1975.74-858,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,2027.032,2035.963,"But I think Mr. Busner, my co-counsel Mr. Busner has stated that it has happened to him, I believe it does happen but that is --"
1975.74-858,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2035.963,2038.528,The record shows that it happens or you make a just a general statement.
1975.74-858,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,2038.528,2039.986,I am just making a general statement.
1975.74-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.704,2058.837,"(Inaudible) I am not clear to just how exactly how you moved to, when the attachment is made, how you move to vacate and just what, I mean what grounds are this Under the New York law?"
1975.74-858,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,2058.837,2071.699,"Mr. justice Marshall,under the New York law as soon as the defendant learns of the attachment, he can immediately move under CPLR 6223 to vacate that attachment."
1975.74-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2127.443,2133.323,"What is your position on all of these grounds, are they in the statute or is it a general effort to (Inaudible)"
1975.74-858,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,2133.323,2138.315,"Well, all of these grounds are matters of judicial interpretation."
1975.74-858,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2140.966,2141.447,(Inaudible)
1975.74-858,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,2141.447,2142.183,What?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3113.815,3119.318,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3509.05,3512.801,Did you put all of that in on your motion to vacate?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3512.801,3513.741,"No, your Honor."
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3513.741,3514.35,Why not?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3514.35,3524.426,"Under 6223, the only basis upon which I can vacate is if the --"
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3524.426,3526.472,Where can I find that section you are talking about?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3526.472,3533.918,"6223, you will find in the brief of Carey at—"
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3533.918,3535.311,Brief of whom?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3535.311,3545.233,In the brief of Carey in the Appendix -- Appendix A in the brief of Carey.
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3545.233,3548.355,(Inaudible)
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3548.355,3555.19,This is the brief of appellant Carey.
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3571.648,3574.342,(Inaudible) it says that you cannot raise it.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3574.342,3591.884,"The cases that have interpreted 6223 say that the only thing I can raise, those cases of Wulfsohn, if we may go to the table of cases but not in their brief."
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3610.815,3612.379,I can get it better.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3614.9,3617.743,"No, your Honor, I did not move to vacate."
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3617.743,3619.906,So how do you know what could have happened?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3619.906,3623.5,"Your Honor, I know this."
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3645.363,3649.842,"Before the State Court could try it, do you rather have a Federal Court to try it?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3649.842,3655.146,"Your Honor, I did not say that your Honor."
1975.74-858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3727.497,3730.879,"Well, you mean the fund to try the case is the fund to pay the debtor?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3730.879,3731.111,No.
1975.74-858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3801.256,3805.926,"In fact, the Harris against Balk type of garnish, isn’t it?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3805.926,3807.831,Not necessarily your Honor.
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3872.709,3880.858,"What do you submit, you are entitled to hear as far as due process is concerned?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3880.858,3886.241,"As far as due process, your Honor, if I would were to draft the statute for New York --"
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3886.241,3889.933,You do not suggest you are entitled to a pre-seizure hearing of any kind?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3889.933,3890.639,No.
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3891.998,3900.731,"And you, but you do suggest that within a reasonably promptly thereafter you should have had an opportunity to do what?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3900.731,3909.999,"First of all, we should have a prompt hearing on certain limited matters."
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3926.3,3932.473,That goes to whether or not the attachment before judgment was justified.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3932.473,3933.3,Yes.
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3934.664,3937.758,Now how about the merits of the case?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3939.852,3945.404,"On the issue of the debt your Honor and we have been going around the circle on that, I noticed—"
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3945.404,3946.534,And I have not --
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3946.534,3949.797,"No, no, my adversary and I, my (Inaudible)."
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3960.299,3961.565,"Well, do you think they have any?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,3979.862,3983.152,"With respect to Wrestling, yes."
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4023.578,4032.086,"You do not, if they refine their papers showing, it would be enough, you do not suggest they have to call witnesses and (Inaudible)"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4032.086,4033.18,"No, your Honor."
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4036.078,4040.783,"Yes, but they can make their case adequately on paper if they --"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4040.783,4041.717,"Oh, yeah."
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4102.298,4106.009,"Now, lets go back a minute to the fraud part."
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4122.457,4123.497,But for sure.
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4123.497,4125.488,I mean with live witnesses.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4125.488,4130.148,"With live ones, because the nexus of the grab here of attachment—"
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4130.148,4131.082,I understand that.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4138.697,4140.381,Now your Honor as to the interpretation --
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4140.381,4144.408,And then you think that this is the final judgment on the fraud?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4144.408,4145.59,No.
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4148.394,4151.309,How much of a showing of fraud that has to be made?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4151.309,4155.023,The showing fraud has to be made with witnesses.
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4155.023,4159.383,"I know but what is the standard, Probable cause?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4159.383,4163.049,"Your Honor,I would need a few days to think about that."
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4164.336,4172.134,"This is what, this is inherent and this is what the issue is here with respect to whether New York law is deficient or not."
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4172.134,4175.117,"You need more then probable cause, your Honor."
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4211.212,4226.564,"When you make your motion, you are entitled to walk in the Court room and sit there and being holy, silent until and unless the plaintiff produces evidence and live witnesses to sufficiently to demonstrate fraud to the level that you have just suggested."
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4226.564,4227.177,Your Honor.
1975.74-858,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4237.418,4239.344,I think that (voice overlap)
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4239.344,4242.416,It would be constitutional.
1975.74-858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4328.102,4332.75,"Are you saying, there is a constitutional right to prevent something from amending their complaint?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4334.549,4338.347,"No, your Honor, the Garnishment statute."
1975.74-858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4398.41,4399.947,Do you say that is unconstitutional?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4401.895,4408.861,"No, I am, no, not, what I am simply saying your Honor, make 6223."
1975.74-858,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4465.675,4468.46,Could I interrupt for just a minute to help me out on the New York law.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4473.483,4477.09,I would read the statute as being worse than Georgia.
1975.74-858,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4478.684,4480.584,"Well, let me get my question out before you try to answer."
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4480.584,4481.416,"Oh, I am sorry."
1975.74-858,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4481.416,4487.397,I do not find any words in the statute that say that judge may not hold an evidentiary hearing.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4502.853,4517.351,"Your Honor there is no case, against your question, there is no case that so states nor is there a case, what has happened is the judiciary through this might point to it the statute is so involved in --"
1975.74-858,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4517.351,4524.447,"In area of the law, have you ever been involved in a case in which a trial judge did hold an evidentiary hearing and a motion to vacate?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4524.447,4532.704,"Your Honor, the only time I came close to it, and it was an argument of the motion and that happened where an attachment was based --"
1975.74-858,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4532.704,4533.663,Yes or no?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4533.663,4534.391,The answer is no.
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4567.66,4571.924,Does the record show that the judge did look at it and the judge did ask for rather --
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4571.924,4573.168,"Your Honor, the only --"
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4573.168,4574.965,Is that true in this case?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4574.965,4575.681,Your Honor.
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4575.681,4577.046,Is that true in this case?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4577.444,4582.349,"No, as far as I am concerned Judge Bryan (ph) called me up and said what is this all about (Inaudible)"
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4582.349,4586.609,Does the record show that the judge asked for additional facts.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4586.609,4588.008,Which judge?
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4588.008,4590.262,The one that signed the attachment eventually.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4590.262,4591.301,"No, no your Honor."
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4591.301,4593.0,It does not show in the record?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4593.0,4594.339,That is their statements.
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4595.793,4597.939,You say it is not in the record?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4597.939,4599.295,"Your Honor, I am stating --"
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4599.295,4599.884,Yes or no?
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4599.884,4604.169,There are corrections made either by the judge or by the clerk.
1975.74-858,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4605.748,4608.423,I give up.[Laughing]
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4608.423,4611.007,"No, your Honor I deny that the judge did that."
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4624.071,4630.417,"That is, let me put a simple case to you and get away from the complications of this case."
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4637.904,4639.111,"Yes, your Honor."
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4639.111,4639.48,All right.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4648.66,4650.117,"Yes, your Honor."
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4650.117,4655.296,You have the right under 6223 to make a motion.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4666.233,4668.159,Your Honor I can cite a specific case --
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4668.159,4668.566,My Question first.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4668.566,4708.628,"Do you go directly to the judge as I did to make the argument with the certificate of doing business or incorporation in New York, as matter of Publisher’s Press versus MS Publishing, And if that judge, Judge Amsterdam does not hear you and she did not, she refused to hear me, I went on an oral motion to the Appellate Division and was heard by Judge Melchowitz(ph) and I presented the document to him and he heard me strictly on the issue of whether we were doing business and nothing else."
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4708.628,4714.152,Prevailed on the issue as to whether or not the defendant was a resident.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4717.178,4722.059,The disposes of the attachment in that particular case—
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4722.059,4723.87,That is all I am asking you at the moment.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4723.87,4724.579,Yes your Honor.
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4724.579,4739.911,"Now, I understood you to say earlier in your argument that 6223 allowed the dismissal of an attachment only for the grounds specified by the three-judge District Court in this case."
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4739.911,4741.37,"Your Honor, it is how you read it."
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4746.428,4748.727,I will put it to you this way.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4768.395,4770.501,"(Inaudible) Of course, no it does not preclude that."
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4770.501,4776.292,It does not preclude that so that is at least one other ground on which an attachment may be dismissed in New York.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4776.292,4777.706,Yes.
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4777.706,4783.941,"Number of other grounds, if the defendant proves there is no ground for attachment --"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4783.941,4785.112,"Your Honor, jurisdiction—"
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4785.112,4786.236,(Inaudible) seven or eight of them.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4786.236,4786.936,Yes.
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4819.891,4834.406,(Inaudible)basis that is that the security of the defendant or the plaintiff is not implicated by the attachment.
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4838.985,4839.411,Yes.
1975.74-858,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4859.31,4871.606,"We have 6223 as denying to the trial judge the right to consider any proper ground that you may present for the dismissal of the attachment, do you?"
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,4871.606,4871.957,No.
1975.74-858,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4993.37,5002.821,"Mr. Ledes, let me just go over it once more if I may cause I am still thinking of your questioning with Mr. Justice White."
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,5010.364,5027.643,"For the purposes of vacating the attachment, it would be my view point, a full adversary hearing where the plaintiff would have had the burden to show that it would probably succeed in proving its fraud allegation."
1975.74-858,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5027.643,5039.644,"That is the,That is the critical defect that you did not have the right by statute to a hearing on the fraud issue at which the burden would have been on the plaintiff to establish probable cause if he could prevail."
1975.74-858,2,31441,john_g_ledes,,5039.644,5050.152,I would add one phrase on the statute and the cases interpreting that very broad amorphous statute.
1975.74-858,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5053.755,5059.962,You have five minutes left Mr. Greenwald.
1975.74-858,3,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,5059.962,5063.201,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-858,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5218.764,5228.978,"Mr. Greenwald, could you tell us the strongest case you have got on the proposition that the moving party on a motion to vacate is entitled to an evidentiary hearing?"
1975.74-858,3,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,5228.978,5239.782,"Well, I think the most recent case, I am not going to say, the strongest case, is of course the exposition in Regnell against Page which I put in as as appendix to my brief, that brief of Carey."
1975.74-858,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5239.782,5241.218,But I am asking the strongest case.
1975.74-858,3,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,5241.218,5242.852,The strongest case?
1975.74-858,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5274.972,5275.767,I will change the question.
1975.74-858,3,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,5280.932,5287.523,"Well I did mention of course the fact, I think would describe as, mentioned to me, the Lily Pons case."
1975.74-858,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5330.928,5334.421,What case is that?
1975.74-858,3,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,5339.941,5346.364,"Well, I think, I cannot off hand state what case and I think that is important."
1975.74-858,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5346.364,5349.87,But do not you feel obliged to find one?
1975.74-858,3,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,5349.87,5362.77,"Well, let me put it this way, Justice Marshall, the fact of the matter is that these were not issues in the State of New York until this three-judge court opinion and judgment came down."
