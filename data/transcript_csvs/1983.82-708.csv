1983.82-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.025,We will hear arguments next in Summa Corporation against State Lands Commission and City of Los Angeles.
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,23.081,26.236,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.66,147.627,"Mr. Christopher, is that a holding or a statement of the California Supreme Court that you are quoting from or one of the California appellate courts?"
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,147.627,152.966,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is the holding of a line of California cases."
1983.82-708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,384.313,387.981,"Mr. Christopher, may I interrupt you and ask you one question?"
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,416.346,429.418,"Well, my view of that is that at that time, that issue was an unsettled issue."
1983.82-708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.129,492.797,"I don't think that answers my question, Mr. Christopher."
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,518.147,535.796,"Mr. Justice Stevens, on your question, I would say that after California entered the union, and before the 1851 Act proceedings, and taking your assumption that such a right did exist--"
1983.82-708,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.796,536.171,Right.
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,536.171,550.54,"--then that right may have passed to California under the equal footing clause, although there is a subsidiary question there, and that is whether or not the equal footing clause covered such partial rights, a question also addressed in the brief."
1983.82-708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.54,556.522,"Mr. Christopher, I am interested in just how this is a federal question."
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,617.124,622.857,"I think that is a much different case than the case here, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,698.215,703.682,Can this case be decided without passing on the treaty problems that you mentioned?
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,703.682,716.425,"Mr. Chief Justice, the treaty is the background for the 1851 Act, and the 1851 Act is the crucial basis for decision here."
1983.82-708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.822,750.055,"Mr. Christopher, don't we have to decide the treaty questions in this case?"
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,750.055,760.689,"Well, you certainly have to decide that the treaty was entitled... the treaty was intended to protect the rights of Mexicans--"
1983.82-708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,760.689,763.157,"Well, now, that very question, isn't that a federal question?"
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,763.157,766.873,"--Yes, I believe that's a federal question as well, Your Honor."
1983.82-708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,766.873,772.2,"Mr. Christopher, let me follow through a little on Justice Rehnquist's inquiry."
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,798.455,806.094,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I know the California Supreme Court took that position."
1983.82-708,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,859.635,871.818,"Mr. Christopher, does the California public trust doctrine embrace any land other than tidal land?"
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,871.818,886.093,"Mr. Justice Powell, the California public trust doctrine is so ambitious that it has been extended to land on the shores of lakes in California."
1983.82-708,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,921.625,929.245,So we are not simply addressing in this case tidal lands in terms of the consequences of a decision?
1983.82-708,0,44235,warren_m_christopher,,929.245,935.071,"--Mr. Justice Powell, this decision really stands on its own bottom."
1983.82-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1017.85,1018.992,Very well.
1983.82-708,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1025.442,1028.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-708,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.031,1425.637,"Mr. Claiborne, is it possible that that holding could rest on the notion that the trust did not in fact change the value of the lands as opposed to a holding that there was no such trust interest."
1983.82-708,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1425.637,1454.36,"The Court adverts, Mr. Justice Stevens, only to one of the claims, which was a claim of a right in the government to use the property for national defense, and the Court firmly rejects that there was any such easement or servitude attaching to these water bottoms, and that therefore any diminishment of value resulting from that cause ought not be taken into account."
1983.82-708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.449,1654.09,"Mr. Claiborne, is it your position, and I take it you say it is supported by the cases if it is, that land grants coming under the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo based on old Mexican grants prior to the accession of... the Mexican cession stand on a different and higher footing in the world of land transactions than, say, a grant from the United States, simply a patent from the United States made by the General Land Office."
1983.82-708,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1654.09,1680.579,"--I wouldn't say on a higher footing, Justice Rehnquist, but this Court has more readily found that Mexican grants include tidelands or submerged lands than it has with respect to original grants by the United States in which there was a like ambiguity."
1983.82-708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.579,1694.123,"Well, in the Borax case in 296 U.S., the Court distinguishes Knight and some of those other cases, saying those involved Mexican land grants, and we are kind of going to apply a different rule where Mexican land grants aren't involved."
1983.82-708,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1694.123,1731.655,"Indeed, and Borax is only one of the most recent decisions in which the Court reaffirmed once again what was done most recently of all in the case in Oregon, Corvalis, that one exception to the rule that water bottoms inure to the state is where in pursuance of international obligations, referring to the Mexican treaty, those water bottoms had been previously alienated to a private grantee."
1983.82-708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.655,1741.087,Ms. Saggese?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,1741.087,1744.351,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1774.994,1779.524,Do you concede that there is a federal question presented here?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,1779.524,1789.13,"Well, Your Honor, there are four possible bases for a federal question, as Summa has stated in its brief."
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.126,1838.735,But may I interrupt?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,1861.02,1869.065,"Well, Your Honor, you would not be interpreting... since the patent did not create a new federal title--"
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.065,1870.738,"Well, that's the argument."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,1886.793,1901.13,"--Yes, but this Court has held in no less than seven cases that patents issued in confirmation of preexisting Mexican titles did not create a new federal title, so we think that that argument is incorrect."
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.193,1908.469,"Yes, but whether it is correct or incorrect is a federal question, is all I am addressing my remark to."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,1908.469,1934.429,"--Well, Your Honor, once again, we would point to those cases that say that when a confirmatory patent is at issue, in order to determine what the Mexican grantees got, that is, whether what they got confirmed was what Mexico had granted them or whether it enlarged... the United States could have enlarged those rights as it could have."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.221,2073.2,"What treaty, Ms. Sagesse, did the New Orleans case grow out of?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2073.2,2081.885,"Well, the New Orleans case came out of the Louisiana Purchase after that property became property of the United States."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.694,2101.035,But there was no expressed counterpart to the provision in the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo in the Louisiana Purchase treaty?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2101.035,2116.793,"I am not aware, but I would think that under international law the United States would have the obligation to respect preexisting titles, and it did set up a board of land commissioners identical to the board of land commissioners in California in purpose--"
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.793,2139.972,"If you are right there, then we are not talking about just a federal right that arises under any patent confirming a prior Mexican grant in the whole Mexican cession area, but we are talking about the area between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico and the Canadian border."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2139.972,2150.527,"--Well, Your Honor, it is true that the United States has acquired a lot of property from other sovereigns, especially from Spain, Mexico, and France."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2190.793,2221.467,"I take it that it isn't entirely impossible under your theory that the Supreme Court of Nebraska, which is a state that was acquired in the Louisiana Purchase, could next year decide that under old French law the state owned the bottom of all the riverbeds, even though that had never been the law in Nebraska up to now, and presumably that would then depend on an examination of the old French authorities prior to the Louisiana Purchase."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2221.467,2257.768,"--Well, Your Honor, if California is correct in this case, Nebraska would have to follow the same type of analysis as California has proposed here, and it would have to be a right that was existing under the previous sovereign, and the analysis would also have to consider whether that right would take away any rights for existing private property rights under the preexisting sovereign, and also determine whether or not that right is consistent with and compatible with its own system of laws."
1983.82-708,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2313.947,2331.297,"Ms. Sagesse, why isn't the California court bound by the determination of the question of historical fact in the 1851 Act proceedings that the lands weren't tidelands?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2331.297,2345.683,"--Well, Your Honor, those proceedings took place pursuant to the Act of 1851, and the board and the General Land Office had a very limited jurisdiction under that Act."
1983.82-708,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2377.187,2381.547,"Well, did it have jurisdiction to determine whether they were tidelands or not?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2381.547,2403.005,"--Well, I think that was an irrelevant question in that proceeding because the purpose of the proceedings in the General Land Office was not to determine the character of property and then if found to be tidal to exclude them, but rather to determine if the surveys that had been made of the ranchos had accurately depicted the boundaries set forth in the decree of confirmation."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2541.902,2559.722,"Ms. Sagesse, some time during your argument would you mind taking out the map that appears at the back of the brief for the petitioner and identifying which of the lands there are the subject of this particular dispute?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2559.722,2560.627,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2580.73,2582.636,The very bottom of the map?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2582.636,2584.087,"Yes, where it connects to the sea."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.602,2588.977,Where it says Del Ray Lagoon?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2588.977,2591.445,--It is north of the entrance channel.
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2591.445,2592.865,North of the entrance channel.
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2592.865,2599.33,I think you can see a little bit of the blue waterway with Ballona Lagoon.
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2599.33,2602.266,Part of the... the southern part of the Ballona Lagoon?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2603.002,2603.517,Yes.
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.681,2624.805,"--No, that is what I was trying to find out."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2626.193,2637.066,"--Our position is that when these tidelands were held by Mexico, they were subject to public rights that are very similar to the public trust."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.864,2679.219,"One point that is made by your opponents, and they dispute the Supreme Court of California on this, I guess, is, they say that we are not really talking here about an incident of sovereignty."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2701.851,2708.801,"Yes, Your Honor, the sovereign rights have always been treated much differently from proprietary rights."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2779.927,2791.314,"Under your theory, is it essential that this public trust doctrine or its counterpart had existed under Mexican law at the time of the 1839 grant?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2791.314,2792.577,"--Well, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.577,2809.368,"In view of the Coronado Beach and some of the others kind of attaching special significance to Mexican land grants, I would think if this hadn't existed under Mexican law you would have a real problem."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2809.368,2810.71,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe so."
1983.82-708,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2814.15,2828.001,"Before you do that, could I ask, what evidence is there in the record about the existence of the easement in the original Mexican grant?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2828.001,2840.67,In the original Mexican grant we have the language that the grantee can enclose the property without prejudice to the traversing roads and servitudes.
1983.82-708,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2840.67,2842.433,That is the only language?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,2842.433,2886.323,"That is the language, Your Honor, which petitioner's own expert witness on Mexican law interpreted at trial to mean a reservation in favor of the public, that it would include the public's rights in tidelands, and California courts have also interpreted this language, servitude in the context of a Mexican ranch grant, to be a reservation in favor of the public, and this Court's holding in Barker versus Harvey is not to the contrary, because in that case this Court only found that an Indian private right of occupancy was not a servitude, but that is consistent with the California courts' determination that only public rights were servitudes under Mexican law."
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.016,3026.03,May I ask you a question?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3036.557,3037.618,That is exactly correct.
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.662,3040.118,--So that is a little different.
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3046.162,3052.69,"In fact, Your Honor, I think that was the only issue that the Court addressed in its opinion, ownership of the fee title of tidelands."
1983.82-708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.69,3054.27,Yes.
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3062.857,3067.279,The state would have the right.
1983.82-708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.215,3074.072,"Well, it could take possession and develop it."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3074.072,3075.12,That's right.
1983.82-708,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.12,3083.941,Do you think that was true of the reserved right which you claimed existed in favor of the sovereign in Mexico and under Mexican law?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3083.941,3090.566,"I don't know, Your Honor, but we do know that it was very... they were both couched in the same terms."
1983.82-708,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3133.735,3141.218,Were there any improvements on this lagoon at the time this complaint was filed?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3141.218,3141.92,"Never, Your Honor."
1983.82-708,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3143.468,3144.482,None today?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3144.482,3145.152,None today.
1983.82-708,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3145.152,3151.368,"Would the owner of the fee have had the right, say, to put a large marina on it?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3151.368,3161.74,"Your Honor, as far as privately owned tidelands subject to the public trust, there are approximately 80,000 acres of such lands in private ownership in the state today."
1983.82-708,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3186.448,3193.946,"Could the city of Los Angeles have enjoined an improvement that it thought interfered, perhaps, with its wetland rights?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3193.946,3218.42,"The only way that... once a development is in... right now there is a procedure in California where if a person wants to make a development on lands within the coastal zone, which would include these lands, it would have to go to the Coastal Commission for a development permit, the Coastal Commission then informs the State Lands Commission that there is going to be a development or one is proposed."
1983.82-708,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3218.42,3221.06,"Before any development could be made, permission has to be obtained?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3221.06,3223.091,By the State Lands Commission.
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.861,3248.048,I am puzzled about that.
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3254.015,3262.933,"The proprietary rights in tidelands can be conveyed by the state as sovereign, but subject--"
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3262.933,3264.153,Can they surrender entirely?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3264.153,3265.385,--Absolutely not.
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3291.484,3303.776,"You rely on the Illinois Central case, which I understood held that if it is this kind of animal, this kind of trust right, the state legislature does not have the power to divest the state of it."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3303.776,3308.183,--That was a case where it was divesting its entire ownership.
1983.82-708,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.273,3311.369,That is what I am asking.
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3316.91,3320.033,"--Fee title and public trust, no."
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3345.583,3352.52,"As I understand it, meanwhile, the fee title, without the permission of the Lands Commission, you can't do anything--"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3352.52,3355.956,"That is not true, Your Honor."
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3362.531,3365.545,"--Yes, but can he make that use... perhaps I misunderstood you."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3375.602,3382.445,"--Well, he can... if a developer wants a determination from the state lands commission, he can have it, and--"
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3382.445,3385.003,"My question is, doesn't he have to get that determination?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3385.003,3392.112,"--I think that under the procedure that is set, it would automatically happen in the course of getting--"
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3392.112,3393.956,It would automatically happen how?
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3395.345,3399.123,--That he would get permission because it would be part of the development permit process.
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3399.123,3402.169,"--My question is, he can't do anything without that permission, can he?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3403.561,3405.667,Unless he didn't want a development permit.
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3414.352,3415.026,"--Well, anything?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3415.666,3417.868,"Well, not without a development permit."
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3426.615,3431.407,"Yes, but what can he do without getting a permit, with the Mexican lands?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3431.407,3438.048,"Well, Your Honor, this land is treated the same as any other tidelands in the state."
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3438.048,3439.592,"I know, but I still don't understand."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3442.825,3446.245,"If he wants to develop... It is not a permit, Your Honor."
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3450.434,3451.167,"Well, whatever it may be."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3451.167,3463.707,"I think that in order to put any kind of a development on it, he would have to go through the governmental permit process or else he couldn't develop it at all, and in going through the governmental development--"
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3463.707,3465.364,He couldn't develop it without it.
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3468.519,3477.952,"--He can make any use of it in its natural condition that it is in now... it has been in this natural condition since, I suppose, the beginning of time."
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3480.046,3480.655,"Well, what does that mean?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3481.638,3495.493,"Well, the public has been making that kind of use of it, the fishing and hunting and clamming and boating and swimming, since the 1800's that we know of, documented in the record, and this use has been going on, and it still goes on now."
1983.82-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3495.493,3499.63,"But it can't produce too much income for the fee title owner, can it?"

1983.82-708,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3501.005,3504.8,"May I follow up, please, ma'am?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3514.998,3515.388,Yes.
1983.82-708,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3515.388,3524.274,They say that thousands of policies have been issued that have not recognized California law to be as your brief describes it.
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3530.272,3531.508,"Well, I don't know, Your Honor."
1983.82-708,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3566.073,3579.956,"Related to that question, has the state of California asserted before this case in other cases involving Mexican rancho grants this public trust?"
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3579.956,3580.818,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-708,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3627.077,3630.703,"Well, it is a recent position taken by the state."
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3630.703,3636.607,"Well, it has only come up... every time it has come up the state has taken that position."
1983.82-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3640.527,3647.272,Very well.
1983.82-708,2,37301,nancy_alvarado_saggese,,3648.321,3648.852,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1983.82-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3648.852,3650.989,"Mr. Christopher, do you have any more?"
1983.82-708,3,44235,warren_m_christopher,,3650.989,3653.208,"Only briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-708,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3715.229,3721.445,"But if they get the permission in the first place, that determination is made by the commission, is it?"
1983.82-708,3,44235,warren_m_christopher,,3721.445,3736.845,"That determination is made by the State Lands Commission, but after a rather exhaustive proceeding, and as you understand, Mr. Justice, the State Lands Commission could insist that the property be kept in open space without the payment of compensation if you were to uphold this public trust."
1983.82-708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3782.797,3783.686,"Thank you, counsel."
