1976.75-5444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.498,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-5444, Coker v. Georgia."
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,19.347,22.36,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1976.75-5444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,353.69,358.28,Do you suggest there are some extenuating circumstances here on this record?
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,358.28,372.017,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the evidence of petitioner’s sanity, insanity, of his alcoholism do indeed constitute mitigating circumstances."
1976.75-5444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,472.942,479.268,"Georgia also authorizes the death penalty, you have already told us, for armed robbery, does it not?"
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,479.268,480.65,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-5444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.65,482.247,"And for kidnapping, does it not?"
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,482.247,491.522,"For kidnapping, when the victim is harmed or ransom secured, it authorizes the death penalty for six capital offenses after Gregg."
1976.75-5444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.72,506.3,"So in non-homicide cases, the death penalty can be imposed for five different offenses under Georgia law?"
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,506.3,514.926,"Four, because the Georgia Supreme Court in the Gregg case held that the death penalty could not be constitutionally imposed for armed robbery."
1976.75-5444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.926,515.881,Despite the statute?
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,515.881,519.674,"Despite the statute, it was a statutory holding, it was not a constitutional holding."
1976.75-5444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,531.227,539.362,You said the Georgia Supreme Court’s ruling that death could not be imposed for armed robbery was a statutory ruling?
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,539.362,541.009,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-5444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.096,566.68,Was it the holding that would apply to all future convictions for armed robbery?
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,566.68,567.882,"Yes, yes it was."
1976.75-5444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,870.317,883.453,"But surely you do not suggest that this court’s Furman decision represents a community consensus that would be the same as if those 17 states had themselves repealed the statute, so you?"
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,883.453,893.002,"Well, I submit that the court’s Furman decision does reflect the desuetude into which the death penalty had fallen in many cases, both murder and rape."
1976.75-5444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,963.95,968.55,How long in time do you give them to react under your standard of --
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,968.55,982.418,"Well, I think probably with those states, it is too short to be sure, but we do know that for example, Louisiana has enacted within a month of this court’s Roberts decision, enacted a death penalty for homicide, for certain kinds of homicide."
1976.75-5444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1038.132,1049.109,"You have mentioned the irreversibility of the death penalty as one of the bases for its infirmity, constitutionally."
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1058.957,1064.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, I did not mean to suggest that that was the only reason for its unconstitutionality in this case."
1976.75-5444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1095.413,1105.806,"You have two concepts there really, have you not, the generality applying to the penalty in all cases and its application to the particular case?"
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1121.457,1122.351,"Yes, we do."
1976.75-5444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1137.736,1139.624,I did not mean error in that sense.
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1156.903,1172.05,"Well, there are certainly other collateral claims presented in this case, which the Court did not grant certiorari on the basis of that would be pursued in collateral proceedings which might demonstrate that because of insanity or some other reason, this death penalty was erroneous."
1976.75-5444,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1179.666,1210.091,"Mr. Kendall, before you proceed, if we have a prison inmate who has been convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to life, a mandatory life sentence under the statute that forbids parole and the inmate escapes and commits another aggravated rape, what punishment do you think would be appropriate?"
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1210.091,1213.116,"That, of course, is not the case presented here."
1976.75-5444,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1213.116,1214.011,I understand that.
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1214.011,1228.004,"But it seems to me that in the circumstances of that case, imprisonment would be an appropriate punishment when judged by what society does to essentially all other people who are convicted of that crime."
1976.75-5444,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1228.004,1233.888,Would that be any punishment for that individual?
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1233.888,1238.063,"Certainly, he would have the stigma of another rape conviction."
1976.75-5444,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1243.63,1247.717,The same way it was protected on the first go-around.
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1255.584,1257.715,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell, that is --"
1976.75-5444,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1257.715,1259.056,Yet he escaped.
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1259.056,1259.994,That is correct.
1976.75-5444,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1261.893,1277.14,"I am not talking about Coker, I was asking your view as to whether or not there could ever be a situation where absent any other punishment, capital punishment would be appropriate for repetitive crimes of rape."
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1277.14,1289.961,"Well, we think that the objective indicators that the Court pointed to in Gregg would indicate that society, where a life has not been taken, the death penalty is inappropriate to protect a value other than life."
1976.75-5444,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1289.961,1296.285,What deterrents would exist in the circumstances I described?
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1296.285,1303.781,I think that the deterrence connotes protection from society it seems to me in that case.
1976.75-5444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.312,1406.458,"Of course, anybody who is serving a life sentence without a hope of pardon or parole who escapes can with practical impunity commit any offense, including whether it would be petty larceny or jaywalking or shoplifting, unless you decide that the only way to give him additional punishment is to put him to death for jaywalking or shoplifting or petty larceny."
1976.75-5444,0,21061,david_e_kendall,,1406.458,1411.425,"Well, this case was really not tried on a recidivism theory."
1976.75-5444,1,17668,b_dean_grindle_jr,,1613.55,1617.756,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1976.75-5444,2,21061,david_e_kendall,,3339.409,3344.813,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points."
1976.75-5444,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3496.203,3499.568,Was not the jury charged on Sections 1 and 2 of that statute?
1976.75-5444,2,21061,david_e_kendall,,3499.568,3506.604,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall they were, but they were charged on the capital felonies of armed robbery, murder and rape."
1976.75-5444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3544.219,3545.016,Thank you gentlemen.
