2003.02-458,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.256,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-458, Raymond Yates v. William T. Hendon."
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,69.557,72.529,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-458,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.754,256.392,"Mr. Holifield, I'm curious whether if... if we were to agree with you that the petitioner could be considered an employee under ERISA, do we have to then go on and address the rest of this rather complicated question on the alienation issue and so forth, or would we remand on that?"
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,256.392,258.166,--Your Honor--
2003.02-458,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.166,259.819,"It wasn't dealt with below, was it?"
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,259.819,261.305,"--No, it wasn't, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.471,271.047,No.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,271.047,272.784,"--raised in this Court, and... and not addressed in the lower courts."
2003.02-458,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,272.784,274.846,What is the... what is that issue?
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,282.482,294.621,The issue that was not addressed in the lower courts is there is the maybe potential conflict with the Bankruptcy Code as far as preference laws and the ERISA anti-alienation provision.
2003.02-458,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.621,311.998,"In other words, this $50,000 wasn't put back until the eve of bankruptcy so even if... even if we agreed with you that Yates can be an employee, this $50,000 still might constitute an unlawful preference."
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,311.998,313.856,"Your Honor, it... it might."
2003.02-458,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,330.453,333.797,"And even if there was, that's not before us."
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,333.797,334.623,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,334.623,341.598,We... theoretically we could agree with you that he's a participant and so forth but still say send it back for the bankruptcy issue.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,341.598,344.032,"That is within the prerogative of this Court, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.76,401.989,Does it have to be a working owner?
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,406.902,409.669,"Possibly, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.488,424.203,That... that would be pretty far afield from the word employee.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,434.068,435.904,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.904,447.443,Was... were FICA and FUTA taxes paid for his labor?
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,447.443,448.369,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,584.699,586.269,Here there were a couple of other--
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,586.269,587.634,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,587.634,588.953,--plan participants at all times?
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,588.953,589.696,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.85,667.555,How does it come in?
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,669.905,670.444,Sure.
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.444,671.391,--complicated in my mind.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,696.572,697.398,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,697.398,702.328,And an owner is not an employee for that purpose.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,702.328,703.138,Correct.
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.138,704.828,And so we look to see.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,715.769,716.634,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,716.634,719.029,Or it gave back because there was somebody else.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,719.029,719.4,Yes.
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.4,724.602,"But step one of that, we had to say that he was an employee of the corporation."
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,724.602,725.716,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.716,727.408,And where does step one come from?
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,727.408,733.974,"Well, step one is just based on common law and the work... and that is what this Court held in Darden."
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.596,735.089,Okay.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,744.377,744.915,--Exactly.
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.915,751.519,So we have to appeal to the common law to say he's... he's an employee under common law principles of the corporation.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,751.519,752.262,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.262,761.921,"Then (b) says... (c) says he isn't one for purposes of ERISA, and (b) says that really wrecks the whole thing unless there's somebody else."
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,761.921,762.831,Correct.
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,762.831,763.696,And that's how it works.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,763.696,765.182,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,765.182,765.532,Okay.
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,765.532,776.494,"And I think if you look at... what the... the holding in the Sixth Circuit, I really think it really creates some policy problems for employee benefit plans that are... are pretty significant."
2003.02-458,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.051,856.333,"Very well, Mr. Holifield."
2003.02-458,0,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,858.023,858.562,Holifield.
2003.02-458,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.562,858.933,Holifield.
2003.02-458,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,862.277,871.109,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-458,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,974.308,975.051,Mr. Roberts--
2003.02-458,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,996.849,997.342,No.
2003.02-458,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1103.391,1108.426,"You're... you're not saying it's entitled to Chevron deference, just substantial weight?"
2003.02-458,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1108.426,1109.252,Yes.
2003.02-458,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1114.453,1115.363,Do we need deference?
2003.02-458,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1115.363,1116.228,--No.
2003.02-458,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1119.738,1127.335,"Well, I don't know why it isn't Chevron, but I mean, what he's referring to is the argument about the mysterious meaning of Mead, which if you'd like to go into it, fine."
2003.02-458,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1127.335,1129.769,--I... I have no desire for--
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1347.151,1348.416,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-458,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1427.24,1428.809,"I mean, for what purpose?"
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1453.45,1453.988,--There... there is.
2003.02-458,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.988,1454.443,--of any kind?
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1457.515,1458.984,"Well, we think there is a difference--"
2003.02-458,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1458.984,1459.91,Which... what is it?
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1459.91,1461.025,--in this case because--
2003.02-458,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.025,1461.751,"No, no."
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1463.814,1467.491,"--Well, in general you're... you're correct that... that you would be--"
2003.02-458,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.491,1467.829,All right.
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1469.265,1469.57,--Okay.
2003.02-458,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.822,1504.993,"--When you talk about control, Mr. Troutman, you're talking about two different people basically."
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1508.913,1521.711,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's why we think that when you have sole shareholders and when you... and when you're dealing with trying to apply a control to only one, it's almost an anomaly."
2003.02-458,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.166,1528.564,"Well, but you... you think then that a sole shareholder for that reason cannot be an employee?"
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1528.564,1547.429,"--We think that for purposes of ERISA, when ERISA is trying to determine whether a person is an employee and an employer and where we're not given much guidance by the statute, we don't think these... number one, we don't think these other statutory provisions give us guidance with a sole shareholder."
2003.02-458,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1573.685,1576.286,Why does it have to be one definition?
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1588.213,1591.351,"--We think under Darden... yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-458,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.302,1615.5,"Well, he is an employer."
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1633.704,1645.675,"Well, I... I guess under that... under that scenario then we would need to look at perhaps what the employer... how the... how the particular person is acting under the plan."
2003.02-458,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1683.211,1701.653,"But that's an issue that everyone agrees is open, that even... even if he's classified as an employee, the creditors may have priority over the plan with respect to that $50,000."
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1701.653,1723.59,"--Yes, I agree with that, but what I was going... what I was... what I was leading to was that when he failed to make those quarterly deductions that are required by the plan, he... that more couches him in terms of an employer because he's the... he's got his employer hat on, in other words, because he's the one that would control what deductions come out of employees' pay or not."
2003.02-458,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1731.292,1739.383,"If he hadn't... if he hadn't loaned any money from the plan, then he would be an employee?"
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1739.383,1741.778,--If he hadn't loaned any money in the plan--
2003.02-458,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1741.778,1742.771,Hadn't borrowed any money.
2003.02-458,2,20199,c_mark_troutman,,1742.771,1743.059,--Borrowed any money.
2003.02-458,3,30887,james_al_holifield_jr,,2307.822,2325.655,"Your Honor, I would just... just point out just a couple quick points here, and that is, there's nothing in ERISA that prevents a person from being or playing or acting in multiple roles."
2003.02-458,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2399.753,2401.256,"Thank you, Mr. Holifield."
