1971.70-98,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.017,"We will hear arguments next in number 98, Santobello against New York."
1971.70-98,0,28459,irving_anolik,,30.314,33.428,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,1562.806,1567.084,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.70-98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.589,1798.112,"Mr. Sullivan, where in the appendix of the record can we find the words of this promise and circumstances under which it is made or does it all rest now just simply on the confession of viewing your colleagues."
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,1798.112,1800.188,"Yes Mr. Justice Stewart, it is my doubt."
1971.70-98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1811.398,1812.682,And that.
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,1812.682,1813.128,Pardon me?
1971.70-98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1813.128,1814.003,And that is all we have?
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,1817.708,1818.715,No.
1971.70-98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1841.48,1844.165,Do we even have that much in writing anymore in the record?
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,1844.165,1846.19,"We do not Mr. Justice Stewart, no."
1971.70-98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1846.19,1850.486,Just your confession before the reports inherently.
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,1850.486,1889.56,"Well, then the problem there was in the review of the record whether we should make it in session or whether on balance, at least in our view, we felt that the man had not been overreached and thus proceeding, and so that that is on 34 (a) of the appellant's appendix. Now, while characterizing the petitioner here, I think I may fairly say on this record that he was engaged in Judge shopping here."
1971.70-98,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.251,2065.393,Trying to do what?
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2065.393,2066.143,Dupe.
1971.70-98,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2091.813,2095.217,How much of the sentence if any has he served?
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2095.217,2104.036,"Oh, I think the matter, he got out on post conviction, bail application Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.718,2192.951,"No, Judge could have been much tougher under this plea of guilty, he gave the maximum sentence."
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2192.951,2204.073,"He did Mr. Justice Stewart but we come again to this probation report which is before to the Court and I am going to suggest shortly, that really there is no alternative."
1971.70-98,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2458.59,2469.3,"Mr. Sullivan, you say on the pre-sentence report that when we study it, we will then know that it those could be done by the maximum sentence?"
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2469.684,2472.487,"Mr. Justice Marshall yes, I say that you will --"
1971.70-98,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2472.487,2481.32,"Then, again, I assume that the district attorney had the same feeling?"
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2481.32,2483.844,That he might the way -- I think he would have gone --
1971.70-98,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2483.844,2487.328,Why did he take his time arguing?
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2487.328,2488.602,I am sorry Mr. Justice.
1971.70-98,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.602,2499.353,"Why did he make the statement that he had to make extra sentencing period, if he was so sure that there was nothing else Judge Marks could do but give him the maximum."
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2503.291,2505.887,"Mr. Justice Marshall I think he could, they could have stopped."
1971.70-98,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.356,2524.526,"But you say we can look at this pre-sentence report which I have looked at, you say we will be overwhelmed and there is nothing else we can do."
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2529.857,2533.862,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not know why is that, I think myself that."
1971.70-98,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.98,2546.071,What we are trying to do is find out what is in the States attorney's mind and what is in the judgeâ€™s mind and --
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2546.071,2551.173,"It is difficult, that is true that this is not the conventional type record that comes up."
1971.70-98,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2580.077,2592.145,"Mr. Sullivan, if this case should go back, do you share opposing counsel's assurance that the felony charges would be reinstated?"
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2592.145,2594.117,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I feel it will yes."
1971.70-98,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2594.117,2599.188,There is no limitations barrier or double jeopardy aspect that you have know of.
1971.70-98,1,21545,daniel_j_sullivan,,2599.188,2599.992,"No, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-98,2,28459,irving_anolik,,2689.61,2691.058,Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-98,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.058,2709.892,"Would you think -- let me ask you this before you start Mr. Anolik, would you suggest that at this case hypothetically were remanded for re-sentencing with fulfillment of the promise before a different judge that, that new judge could not approach the matter with an open mind?"
1971.70-98,2,28459,irving_anolik,,2709.892,2713.036,I would say he could not for two reasons.
1971.70-98,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2713.036,2714.782,It does it make any difference who he is?
1971.70-98,2,28459,irving_anolik,,2714.782,2717.157,"Well, as they say theoretically --"
1971.70-98,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2717.157,2717.926,Is that your point?
1971.70-98,2,28459,irving_anolik,,2717.926,2721.187,"Well, theoretically it is possible, Chief Justice."
1971.70-98,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2739.627,2743.856,"But that is something, that is something we are capable of evaluating."
1971.70-98,2,28459,irving_anolik,,2755.849,2764.197,"I would say it would be extremely difficult Mr. Chief Justice because I know from my own experiences, the case has received a great deal of notoriety in New York."
1971.70-98,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2819.993,2832.716,"Mr. Anolik, what would the maximum sentence be under the -- if your client was f found guilty or pleaded guilty to two original felony charges?"
1971.70-98,2,28459,irving_anolik,,2832.716,2835.411,"Well, if a consecutive concurrent from this --"
1971.70-98,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2835.411,2836.261,(Inaudible).
1971.70-98,2,28459,irving_anolik,,2836.261,2843.747,"I would say it, I believe it is the eight years all together I believe, it would be eight years, that would be the theoretical maximum --"
1971.70-98,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2843.747,2844.677,Four on each count?
1971.70-98,2,28459,irving_anolik,,2844.677,2845.043,Yes.
1971.70-98,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2907.165,2908.899,Thank you Mr. Anolik.
