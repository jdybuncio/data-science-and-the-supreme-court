1990.89-1363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1363, United States against Darlina France."
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,12.391,15.176,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.872,225.179,What if the error was that the dispute was not... did not comply with article III requirements?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,236.737,244.474,"I think in some cases it could, Your Honor, and let me suggest that I think there is a difference because that depends entirely on who that person was."
1990.89-1363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.343,284.097,Is that true even where Gomez makes clear that Congress has not authorized magistrates to carry out this function?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,284.097,285.049,"--Oh, I think so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.98,316.92,"Well, the question then becomes whether it is plain error under these circumstances, when it is not an article III judge and Congress has not authorized it."
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,316.92,317.553,That is right.
1990.89-1363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.132,371.202,What case comes closest to resolving the issue in this case?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,372.602,392.699,"Well, I think the... that issue is... directly addressed by the Davis case, for example, in 411 U.S., in which the Court held that there could be a waiver of a right to have your grand jury selected in a nondiscriminatory fashion."
1990.89-1363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.096,442.881,"Yes, but of course in Schor Congress authorized the scheme."
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,442.881,444.583,"--Well, that's true."
1990.89-1363,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.366,447.199,That certainly doesn't exempt--
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,447.199,450.751,"--That is right, but I am addressing... I am addressing with respect to Schor the constitutional question."
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,462.976,467.112,"--Mr. Bryson, could a magistrate pick a grand jury?"
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,467.112,470.314,"--Your Honor, I think--"
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,470.314,473.766,Is there any end to it?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,473.766,482.186,--I think a magistrate could pick a grand jury in the sense that typically I think a grand jury is selected by the clerk of the court.
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,494.294,499.631,"If an objection is made to a grand jury member, could a magistrate pass on it?"
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,499.631,505.785,--If a grand jury member seeks excuse from services?
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,505.785,506.135,"No, sir."
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,513.105,517.676,"Well, if that is done after the fact, in the course of... let's suppose that is done in the course of litigation."
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,524.412,535.22,"Well, as of right now in your experience, how many cases do you know of where somebody has objected to a magistrate picking the jury?"
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,538.256,539.672,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,540.906,541.224,Before?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,541.224,541.724,--Yes.
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,553.516,555.082,What's the difference between that case and this case?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,555.082,557.301,"--Well, we submit that the difference is--"
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,557.301,559.086,The formality of saying I object.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,559.086,561.536,"--Well, we believe it is much more than a formality, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,564.371,564.704,xxx.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,564.704,568.656,"Well, I think it is more than a formality, and I would like to address that--"
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,568.656,570.691,xxx did Gomez object?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,570.691,571.741,--Yes.
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,573.227,573.91,xxx case.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,573.91,574.843,--That's right.
1990.89-1363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.444,707.429,Plain and harmless error?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,707.429,720.803,"--Well, the difference is that something in order to be... there may be errors that... as to what you cannot say that they are harmless, because you simply cannot say with the confidence that is required for the harmless error doctrine--"
1990.89-1363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.803,721.922,Did I read your brief right?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,729.909,733.813,"--Well, I think typically you have to look at each case to decide whether a particular error is plain."
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.351,795.803,May I just ask you a question?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,801.707,804.191,"Well, I think it is conceivable that--"
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.191,805.843,Because the rule doesn't talk about what's plain.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,807.795,815.365,"--The language of the rule would be open to saying that the error is plain, that is to say it's an obvious error, but it really doesn't effect--"
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.365,815.649,But who cares.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,815.649,824.99,"--The way this Court has read the rule is, it seems to me virtually makes it impossible for you to have a plain, harmless error, because the rule has been read to include--"
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,824.99,827.573,You think every plain error is reversible error?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,829.441,829.741,--Yes.
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.741,831.143,Every plain error is--
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,831.143,832.776,"I think it has come to that, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.916,844.384,--You don't think it's saying in order to establish a plain error justifying reversal?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,844.384,857.108,"--Well, I think it would be a very hard argument to make, and I am not making it, to say that an error could be both plain and also harmless."
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.108,858.725,And plain being something other than obvious.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,858.725,862.929,You could use the language that way but I think the way the Court has used the term plain error incorporates the notion of--
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.929,864.246,It is both obvious and reversible.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,864.246,864.629,--Exactly.
1990.89-1363,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,866.23,868.332,You don't have to go that far to win.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,868.332,869.515,"Well, no."
1990.89-1363,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,881.223,884.609,And in order to reach that question do we have to reach the article III question?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,884.609,894.531,"Well, I don't think you have to, because I think that you can resolve the question without addressing the question of whether there actually was an article III violation here."
1990.89-1363,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.063,929.288,"Mr. Bryson, just to... just to round out what your view of the plain error rule is, what if it produces a miscarriage of justice but is not... but is not obvious?"
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,941.529,952.653,"Well, I think the way this Court has interpreted the rule, the fact that it was... if it's a miscarriage of justice I think it's going to be regarded as plain."
1990.89-1363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.246,972.817,"Well, about the only time anybody has ever called an error plain is when they reverse something, isn't it?"
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,972.817,973.8,--That's right.
1990.89-1363,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.708,992.861,What it boils down to is you read rule 52(b) to say plain errors or defects must be noticed.
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1000.115,1003.983,--I think that that is effectively what the Court has... the way the Court has read the rule.
1990.89-1363,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1130.649,1132.184,Why do you say it was likely?
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1132.184,1137.838,"Well, it, the Court granted rehearing en banc from a panel that had gone the same way as the Ninth Circuit."
1990.89-1363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.524,1172.476,"If there had been an objection, then the judge might have picked the jury himself."
1990.89-1363,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1172.476,1173.595,"--He might have, that is right."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1503.473,1504.442,"It's Levine, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1504.442,1505.175,I'm sorry.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1505.925,1506.825,"That's all right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.577,1561.243,"Mr. Levine, may I ask a preliminary question?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1561.243,1561.51,--Yes.
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.51,1565.731,"You say we start from the proposition that that's error, and the question is whether it is waived or so forth."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1565.731,1566.147,Yes.
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.147,1577.17,"Is it not at least theoretically conceivable that one could say that if the parties both consent to the use of a magistrate for the purpose of picking the jury, for conducting the voir dire, that it's not error at all?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1577.17,1582.657,"Well, of course that didn't happen here."
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1583.442,1589.262,"Well, assume that the... assume that one treats the absence of an objection as the equivalent of consent, at least hypothetically."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1589.262,1592.012,"Well, that jumps right to the constitutional question."
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.82,1602.57,It would be unconstitutional.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1602.57,1614.192,"--it would be unconstitutional, because it is an article III structural right, which as Justice O'Connor intimated in Schor, is a structural right that cannot be waived."
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.935,1643.111,"Does that mean if, for example in a felony trial, the judge has a lot of confidence in two lawyers with experience such as yourself and an adversary who is equally experienced, and the first 10 questions are kind of boilerplate, where do you live, where did you go to school, are you married."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1660.489,1669.428,"Well, for 10 minutes to answer a phone call, I would be hard pressed to say that there was a structural violation."
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.428,1671.444,"Well, by the time he got back they'd be finished with the case."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1671.444,1673.527,"Well, that's another question."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.614,1741.004,"Well, what is your authority for that very... rather general and ambitious statement, Mr. Levine, that the public has a right to know that the criminal justice system is being presided over by an article III judge?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1741.004,1747.158,"--Well, as I say, I hope the Court doesn't have to reach the issue of whether it is not a waivable right, but my argument for that is this."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.924,1749.86,"I was asking you what case, not what argument."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1749.86,1753.812,"--Well, I don't have a direct case, but I have cases by analogy."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.94,1802.475,"Those... those are, as I understood them, First Amendment cases."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1802.475,1803.058,True.
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1803.058,1809.046,"It... this partakes of nothing of the First Amendment, so far as I can tell."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1809.046,1811.898,"No, it... that's true, but the interests at stake are similar."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.751,1873.638,"Well, a... a right?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1876.256,1878.389,A requirement in a constitutional sense.
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.157,1911.847,"Well, any Federal judge who sits by designation in the country has to have my assignment to do so, the assignment of the Chief Justice."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,1933.593,1933.743,No.
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.385,2008.622,"Excuse me, could you tell us a good reason why they shouldn't, if on direct review they do?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2025.501,2028.12,"--This is just in Federal... this case is only going to arise in Federal courts, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.655,2033.857,--But I'm talking about the futility doctrine.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2033.857,2034.223,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.223,2042.129,"Why shouldn't the futility doctrine, if it applies in this context, not apply as well in habeas corpus cases?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2042.129,2045.414,"Well, the futility doctrine is really in Federal court--"
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.414,2047.347,Which we said it doesn't.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2047.347,2047.949,--You have said that.
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.491,2171.245,You say really that the Ninth Circuit didn't need a futility exception to reach this question?
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2171.245,2171.514,That's right.
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.953,2297.745,"Let's assume that... let's assume that there was an express waiver, and that the waiver would not be subject to your structural argument."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2310.255,2312.588,I think it could.
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.193,2324.645,"That's, you say that... yeah, but then you are arguing plain error."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2324.645,2337.405,"--Well, I'm arguing... first of all I'm arguing if it's a structural error of the magnitude such as I... I suggest to the Court that it is, a court of appeals, even in an express consent, is going to say I'm sorry, parties, you can't consent."
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.274,2347.011,"Well, suppose Gomez had never been decided, but the issue came up?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2360.286,2361.603,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.639,2366.591,Suppose Gomez had never been decided.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2366.591,2366.857,Yes.
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.857,2368.674,And... but there was a waiver of--
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2368.674,2369.376,Express waiver.
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.376,2372.995,--An express waiver says let's go ahead with the magistrate.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2378.649,2380.849,The... the court of appeals can do that.
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.373,2392.723,But you have to get to--
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2401.764,2402.764,"Well, no."
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2403.897,2404.966,Supervisory power.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2405.632,2411.37,"--In the interests of justice, as it was in this case."
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.738,2415.288,--But that is plain error.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2416.69,2419.892,"--Well, I'll move to plain error then."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.147,2465.634,"When you say jurisdiction to preside, do you mean anything more than Congress had not authorized the magistrate to preside here?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2465.634,2469.955,--I am not sure what I mean when jurisdiction to preside.
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.522,2472.59,Then maybe you should use a different phrase.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2472.59,2473.074,--All right.
1990.89-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.199,2600.257,"You know one point you haven't touched, I don't think, if the magistrate committed error you could go to the judge then and there and get it corrected."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2602.459,2606.244,"Theoretically, except that this Court in Gomez--"
1990.89-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2606.244,2606.627,"No, no."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2611.231,2612.615,--The judge was there.
1990.89-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2613.465,2614.017,Was he available?
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2614.017,2614.8,--He was available.
1990.89-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2615.983,2618.634,"Well, how are you injured by that?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2618.634,2619.518,I was injured--
1990.89-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.518,2621.753,"It's about 5 minutes, that's all."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2621.753,2624.972,--I was injured in the same way the defendant in Gomez was injured.
1990.89-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2631.209,2634.311,All you have is Gomez?
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2634.311,2636.061,"Well, that's... that's all."
1990.89-1363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2637.346,2638.713,And you say that is enough.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2638.713,2643.75,"--that's 9 to 0, very strong holding in the United States v. Gomez."
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.664,2694.85,"It's just as much error, but is it just as much plain?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2694.85,2696.302,I... I believe it is.
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.49,2709.275,One is plain enough that... well--
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2709.275,2711.894,"Well, what is the real distinction?"
1990.89-1363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.702,2736.193,"--But Mr. Levine, say the function of drafting jury instructions was delegated by the trial judge in the first instance to the lay... two citizens who are the lawyers for the respective parties."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2744.282,2744.732,No.
1990.89-1363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.732,2746.9,Done entirely by this panel of two citizens.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2746.9,2747.65,No.
1990.89-1363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.602,2756.09,"But here in our case the two citizens that are involved are the lawyers for the parties, plus a magistrate who is not a total stranger to the process."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2756.09,2756.506,--Yes.
1990.89-1363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.41,2762.627,By the judge.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2762.627,2766.462,"Well, not only by the judge, by the Constitution and by the structure of the system."
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.949,2783.519,"Mr. Levine, rule 51(b) says that, it is headed up"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2791.542,2791.959,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.959,2802.599,"Now I suppose... are the, do you think plain error and defects affecting substantial rights are the same thing, or is plain error different from--"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2802.599,2807.568,"I read it as the same thing, but I can't say."
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.568,2814.574,--So you say at least this error affected substantial rights?
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2814.574,2814.84,Yes.
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.709,2822.311,"Which Gomez would... would prove, I gather?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2822.311,2823.477,"Yes, exactly."
1990.89-1363,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2823.477,2831.25,"Counsel, is there anything in the record to show what Judge Kalaherst's practice was in his own district in delegating the selection of the jury?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2831.25,2835.119,"No, nothing in the record, Your Honor, in fact, and I don't know."
1990.89-1363,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2835.119,2844.807,"Because he was a visiting judge, and it might... it's perfectly plausible that if there had been an objection he would have instructed the... selected the jury."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2844.807,2851.378,"I beg to differ with Your Honor, because first of all magistrates conduct the jury on Mondays."
1990.89-1363,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.7,2864.686,"Well, but there could be an objection at that time."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2864.686,2872.708,"Well, I submit that that would be futile, given that the policy is established by the chief judge of Hawaii."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2951.974,2963.699,"Well, what if there had been no Ninth Circuit precedent at all on this point, but the chief judge of the District Court of Hawaii had made it very clear in earlier cases that you had tried that this was his view of the law?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2963.699,2964.718,"No, then there's no excuse."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.853,2973.74,"Well, you can't rely on a ruling of the district judge?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2973.74,2974.174,No.
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.174,2979.893,"You have... but you can rely on the court of appeals, even though you could have brought the case further and brought it here?"
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2979.893,2982.409,"Well, Your Honor, I asked this Court to grant certiorari."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2989.915,2992.367,But we did finally grant certiorari in Gomez.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,2992.367,3011.929,"But who... who... all I am suggesting is, as Justice Scalia wrote when he was on the D.C. Circuit in the Byers case, could a reasonable attorney in essence have fought objection futile in that case, when the attorney did not object to the admission of the psychiatrist's testimony."
1990.89-1363,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3044.198,3050.537,So on this point you think what is futile in the Ninth Circuit might not be futile in the Fifth?
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,3050.537,3052.054,That's right.
1990.89-1363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3060.559,3070.498,"May I ask you to comment on another argument they make, that... especially when you got a new judge you haven't tried cases before, and you know the magistrate."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,3084.972,3085.508,All right.
1990.89-1363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.251,3133.405,"You do know there's a difference, because most cases of plain error, it is perfectly obvious when you look at the matter later."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,3139.143,3140.326,--Well--
1990.89-1363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.326,3143.344,Which isn't necessarily true in this scenario.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,3143.344,3144.227,"--Plain error, that's a funny thing."
1990.89-1363,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3146.496,3147.664,That's right.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,3147.664,3148.598,"I mean, Gomez seems obvious now."
1990.89-1363,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.258,3165.293,It became obvious.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,3165.293,3166.01,It became obvious.
1990.89-1363,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.435,3210.822,I considered myself bound by D.C. Circuit precedent in Byers.
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,3211.972,3216.926,"Well, but that didn't say it could have been futile, I don't believe."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3217.259,3222.13,"Thank you, Mr. Levine."
1990.89-1363,1,36198,michael_r_levine,,3222.13,3222.647,"Thank you, Your Honors."
1990.89-1363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3222.647,3224.331,"Mr. Bryson, do you have rebuttal?"
1990.89-1363,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3224.331,3225.981,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1990.89-1363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.502,3311.52,Had the visiting judge arrived the preceding Friday?
1990.89-1363,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3311.52,3314.139,--I... I don't know whether the judge had arrived--
1990.89-1363,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.139,3315.022,Then we really don't know whether she could have done that.
1990.89-1363,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3315.022,3320.126,"--but the judge would certainly have been aware of any motions that had been filed in court, and would have been in a position to act on them."
1990.89-1363,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3411.77,3413.588,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
