2010.10-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.305,"We will hear argument first this morning in case 10-10, Turner v. Rogers."
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,6.768,9.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,32.054,50.922,It's -- it's a formal adversary proceeding in a very limited sense and not in the sense that caused us to require counsel to be provided in criminal proceedings where the other side is armed with the legal knowledge that the poor defendant does not have.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,55.477,59.266,"Well, Justice Scalia, the answer is yes and no."
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,65.118,65.997,I'm talking about counsel.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,81.543,83.968,--I think it is -- the contrary is true.
2010.10-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,140.392,143.447,"Well, if we agree with you, isn't this going to create an imbalance?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,148.419,154.438,"Ms. Rogers -- in most of the proceedings, and it -- it does vary from one to the other."
2010.10-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,165.028,165.308,Yes.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,237.906,239.619,"Not at all, Justice Alito."
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.367,274.063,--Why don't you argue for a rule that -- that the State must provide counsel for the defendant in these cases where it has provided counsel or there is paid counsel on the other side?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,275.609,281.293,"--That would certainly be more than fair, and the number of instances -- let -- let's be clear about this."
2010.10-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,326.56,327.193,When you asked--
2010.10-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.193,340.493,"Mr. Waxman, in your opening statement you said whenever, in civil contempt, a person is subject to incarceration he or she is entitled to counsel."
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,383.28,398.409,"It is definitely the broader claim; that is, this -- this decision about counsel has to be determined ex ante, because the State -- and this is our limit -- I suppose our more limited request for a categorical rule."
2010.10-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.261,409.483,"Well, my -- my question follows from what I think Justice Ginsburg must have in mind."
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,450.907,452.34,"--No, no, no."
2010.10-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,470.258,471.471,You're committed to custody until you testify.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,471.471,472.321,--Well--
2010.10-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.321,473.433,"""Mr. Bailiff, take him out. """
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,473.433,492.534,"--There -- the cases have recognized the distinction, Justice Kennedy, between direct contempt and indirect contempt; and direct contempt, which is a witness in the courtroom refuses to testify, the cases have -- both civil and criminal -- have not required the appointment of counsel or a jury trial or anything like that."
2010.10-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,543.07,571.531,"Mr. Waxman, the Solicitor General suggests that the failure in this case or the failure to appoint counsel arises from a due process complaint that the -- that the -- that the Petitioner here didn't know that he had indigency as a defense, or what he needed to prove or to bring to court to prove that."
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,603.715,604.249,The reason--
2010.10-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.249,605.112,What do you need?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,605.378,612.076,--The reason it doesn't satisfy -- even if the -- even if the defendant is advised that there is an inability-to-comply defense.
2010.10-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,653.954,655.0,--He admitted that.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,655.0,657.26,"--Well, no, he admitted that--"
2010.10-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,657.26,658.972,At least up until the accident.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,658.972,659.272,--Yes.
2010.10-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,682.379,693.035,"And you don't think an individual is capable of saying, I can't -- I'm -- yes, I am or no I'm not using up my money on drugs; that's my preference?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,693.035,694.998,"I mean, the -- the first of all--"
2010.10-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,694.998,699.554,"Or I have a $1,500 car, but I need it to be able to do something else?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,699.554,712.57,"--Justice Sotomayor, even leaving aside all of those undecided questions under South Carolina -- legal questions under South Carolina law, even as to the facts that you've addressed, the burden is not insignificant."
2010.10-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,729.458,730.175,Where is that form in the record?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,730.175,730.738,--Hmm?
2010.10-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,730.738,732.034,Where is the form in the record?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,732.034,736.839,The form is in the trial record; we did not include it in the -- in the joint appendix.
2010.10-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,751.735,752.085,--Counsel--
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,752.085,753.977,--but I think the Court's lodging rules--
2010.10-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,753.977,755.161,--Counsel !
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,755.161,757.487,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry."
2010.10-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,757.487,762.209,You have stressed that the burden in this case is on the defendant.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,765.217,769.19,I think the case would -- our case would not be as strong.
2010.10-10,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,832.678,833.341,Mr. Waxman--
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,833.341,833.924,That's our--
2010.10-10,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,833.924,854.371,"--suppose the Court thinks that -- suppose the Court looks at this record and thinks this is a broken system and a violation of due process, but requiring a counsel in every case may go too far, and there may, in fact, be alternate procedures that a State could adopt that would comply with due process."
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,868.667,888.981,"--Certainly -- I mean, we think that given the way the adversary system works and given the legal nature of the determination that a judge makes depriving somebody of liberty, and given the significant burdens that are faced in carrying the burden to establish that, there are none."
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.396,975.475,"Mr. Waxman, for those of us who think the Due Process Clause doesn't contain whatever we think it ought to contain, but contains what the people who ratified it thought it contained, what's the earliest case that you have which adopts the proposition that you're now espousing, that whenever a civil contempt citation is imposed upon an indigent person, that person is entitled to counsel as a matter of due process?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,975.475,981.727,"--Justice Scalia, if I had such a case, it would have appeared quite prominently in my brief."
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.861,1112.092,"Whenever there is an erroneous judgment in a civil contempt case, it becomes a criminal contempt case; is that -- is that what you're saying?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1112.092,1139.903,"This -- this Court has said in Bagwell and in Gompers that in the event that the sentence applied -- in Bagwell it was a fine, in Gompers it was imprisonment -- served only punitive purposes and could not be coercive because the defendant could not comply, that sentence was unlawful because it had not been imposed following a proceeding in which the government--"
2010.10-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.903,1142.813,I'm still curious -- are you finished?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1142.813,1171.904,"--But, yeah -- just in -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer, just to finish this sentence -- that is the sine qua non of the distinction, and unlike, for example, the immigration context and the other contexts that the government is relying on, this is a situation in which the consequence of an error, that is an erroneous outcome renders the detention an unlawful criminal penalty."
2010.10-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1173.95,1176.626,Are you saying all the trappings of criminal procedure come with it?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1183.062,1196.941,"No, Justice Ginsburg, this Court has made -- we're talking about a determination ex ante, before the man is sent to jail, in this case for repeated long periods, should he be appointed counsel."
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.708,1226.032,"My goodness, if -- if you're relying for that proposition only on the fact that we've already said it, why don't you also say we've never said what you want us to say now?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1231.42,1252.864,"It wasn't wrong, Justice Scalia, and as we've pointed out, the majority of States and all seven circuits that have spoken to this question have all held that there is, in fact, a right to appointed counsel before the State in an -- in an assertedly civil contempt proceeding can deprive a human being of his liberty."
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.864,1261.391,"But if all of the arguments you're making to us are correct, why shouldn't the other accompaniments of a full dress criminal trial apply?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1261.391,1261.841,Because--
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.841,1271.882,"So he has counsel, but the burden's been put on him rather than on the State to prove, in fact, that he -- whether or not he is indigent?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1271.882,1273.762,--Because the proceeding is civil.
2010.10-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.658,1293.892,Why is it--
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1293.892,1296.751,--I'm sorry -- and because it is a civil proceeding--
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1296.751,1298.631,It's an illogical distinction is what I'm saying.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1298.631,1301.157,--Well--
2010.10-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.157,1302.62,Maybe Justice Alito can--
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1303.72,1304.653,"--Yes, Justice Alito?"
2010.10-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1304.653,1308.959,Why isn't something like what the solicitor general suggested adequate here?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1348.69,1358.68,"It's -- that submission is inconsistent with how the adversary process works, and more importantly, Justice Alito, it misunderstands the nature of the burden."
2010.10-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1382.004,1386.726,You think the issue here is more complicated than the issue about whether somebody's probation should be revoked?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1386.726,1403.53,"--Well, what Gagnon v. Scarpelli said was in any -- in the mine-run of cases, all that is required with respect to somebody who has a highly reduced liberty interest in an informal proceeding is whether or not they have subsequently been convicted, yes or no."
2010.10-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1423.148,1433.371,"Mr. Waxman, you mentioned Lassiter, and you mentioned something that Lassiter said in passing, but what was at stake there was deprivation of parental status."
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1465.055,1465.672,Right.
2010.10-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1502.841,1539.664,"--My concern is -- and it's been brought up in some of the other questions that Justice Ginsburg asked earlier -- I just have the sense that there are thousands of these hearings around the country, and they're -- and they're very important in order to ensure child support, and that if we adopt your rule, in many cases where counsel are now waived or not present because of the -- the noncompliant parent is going to ask for counsel and that we're going to change the entire landscape of domestic relations proceeding, the Heisenberg principle."
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1539.664,1547.894,"Justice Kennedy, the vast majority of jurisdictions require counsel and provide counsel, and there is no -- we would think if this were--"
2010.10-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1547.894,1549.107,In every case?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1555.838,1564.533,"--I believe the rule is that if you have a right to counsel, the court is required to advise you that if you -- that you have one, and if you are unable to afford--"
2010.10-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.533,1573.143,"My question is: Do you -- are there any data -- are there any data to show that in most of these cases, counsel does, in fact, appear?"
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1573.96,1575.356,--I'm not aware--
2010.10-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1575.356,1576.236,My assumption is not.
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1576.236,1578.912,--I'm not aware of data one way or the other.
2010.10-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1589.735,1592.411,Does that go for alimony and palimony as well as child support?
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1592.411,1599.976,--It would go to any instance in which an alleged civil contemnor is facing incarceration.
2010.10-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1599.976,1600.476,"Yes, it did."
2010.10-10,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1600.759,1608.29,"Yes, and can demonstrate an inability to afford counsel in the same way that happens in misdemeanor cases."
2010.10-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1610.253,1610.953,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1621.456,1624.352,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-10,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1644.436,1652.48,"Ms. Kruger, you say that the procedures here were inadequate, but that counsel in every case is not necessarily required."
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1699.726,1702.136,"--No, I don't think you are, Justice Kagan."
2010.10-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1713.922,1714.355,I'm sorry.
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1715.818,1716.284,--I'm sorry.
2010.10-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1784.044,1797.544,"Counsel, as I -- and then I think one of the deficiencies in addressing your argument is that I don't really know what the State's procedures are."
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1860.348,1875.94,"I think that's right, and I think it's also right that South Carolina, at least insofar as the record reveals, doesn't require a finding that the alleged contemnor has the ability to comply with a purge condition, as opposed to requiring a finding of willful violation of the court's order."
2010.10-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1875.94,1892.449,"Well, the -- the form, the order for contempt of court itself, 61A, does require the judge to fill out an answer as to whether he thinks the defendant is gainfully employed or has the ability to make the payments."
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1895.058,1903.319,"The -- the question on the form relates to a past condition, as opposed to present ability to comply with a purge condition."
2010.10-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.911,1916.736,Why -- why isn't the requirement that the judge satisfy himself that there's a willful failure to comply with the order?
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1925.013,1926.096,Justice--
2010.10-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.096,1927.309,It's not willful if he can pay.
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1930.485,1931.381,--If he can't pay--
2010.10-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.381,1932.327,You know what I mean.
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1932.327,1933.127,--I do know what you mean.
2010.10-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.187,1968.47,I see.
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1968.47,1970.446,--carry out their financial obligations.
2010.10-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1970.446,1974.622,"Counsel, just to be clear, your answer to the question presented is no, right?"
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1981.936,1983.529,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-10,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.918,2006.056,"Is there a State -- we've been told that in many States appointment of counsel for an indigent, noncustodial parent who has -- who has child custody -- that counsel is automatic."
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2019.989,2026.703,--I don't think that there is any one place you can look in order to see what -- features States are employing.
2010.10-10,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2069.923,2074.562,"What about, an aid who is not counsel?"
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2096.589,2123.671,"I think it would certainly be open to the Court to consider whether or not having the assistance of a layperson who may not necessarily be a lawyer would be a requirement of due process, but I think given the nature of the inquiry which goes to financial condition, it's the kind of information that individuals provide on a regular basis without the assistance of either competent lay people or lawyers with legal expertise."
2010.10-10,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.856,2154.939,"Is the form you have in mind something different than the form, the IFP form that would be filled out say, by a 2255 petitioner?"
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2154.939,2162.769,"I don't think it would, Justice Ginsburg, but precisely what the form would contain would have to be tailored to the law in the relevant jurisdiction."
2010.10-10,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2207.686,2225.741,"Ms. Kruger, could you say a bit more about the question that Mr. Waxman and Justice Scalia were talking about: how often these proceedings have the State on one side, how often they have the custodial parent on one side, whether there is counsel for the opposite side in many of these cases?"
2010.10-10,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2225.741,2229.084,"There is in some, but not all, Justice Kagan."
2010.10-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2241.85,2243.129,"Thank you, Ms. Kruger."

2010.10-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2311.219,2318.071,"The South Carolina Supreme Court, as I understand, heard this case after he was released, so they didn't consider it moot."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2318.071,2324.005,"Your Honor, the issue was not briefed or argued or raised."
2010.10-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2330.903,2332.7,Suppose--
2010.10-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2332.7,2335.292,"But it was a fact, was it not, that he was already released?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2335.292,2336.755,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2336.755,2342.106,"--I suppose -- we have held, haven't we, that States can have different concepts of mootness than the Federal one?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2342.106,2344.069,"Yes, Your Honor, that's right."
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2367.492,2375.753,"Counsel, do we have jurisdiction over any matter that isn't rendered in a final judgment in State court?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2375.753,2378.05,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2378.05,2389.169,"So if we don't have jurisdiction over anything but a final judgment, how could we ever grant a stay if the State refused to?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2389.169,2392.179,I -- your--
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2392.179,2394.605,If a State refused to grant a stay.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2394.605,2395.721,--I--
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2395.721,2402.585,"And why would South -- why would the State here have granted a stay, if it believes there's no Sixth Amendment right whatsoever to counsel?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2409.9,2421.14,"--Your Honor is correct that the relief would be coming from the South Carolina State courts, and South Carolina ruled 241(c) appears to be tailor-made for this situation."
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2430.0,2439.778,Can you point to any case involving support payments in which the South Carolina court has ever granted a stay?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2439.778,2464.397,"--The closest I can point to is Berry v. Januario, a South Carolina State court case involving parental termination -- termination of parental rights from a family court, where the South Carolina Supreme Court stayed the matter; and so if Petitioner had asked, there's a substantial likelihood the court would have granted a stay through the South Carolina Supreme Court; at this point under rule 23 this Court could affirm--"
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.397,2466.74,Did the Petitioner know about rule 23?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2469.416,2474.137,--He had counsel as of no later than three weeks after the trial court hearing.
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.267,2478.276,"Okay, before -- before it got up to the--"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2478.276,2481.869,"That's right, 11 months before the case became moot."
2010.10-10,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2492.822,2501.137,Is it correct for me to think of both the Petitioner's argument and your response as a Mathews v. Eldridge problem?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2501.137,2502.6,No.
2010.10-10,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2515.099,2529.395,"Well, it -- it does seem that absolute right and Mathews v. Eldridge is not quite a -- a good fit, but it seems to me that most of Mr. Waxman's arguments can be subsumed within the Mathews v. Eldridge framework."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2529.395,2542.811,"Yes, that is his fallback argument, though it wasn't developed in the courts below, but I think it's important to note that because his argument approaches and, in fact, leads with an absolute claim to note the breadth of the rule."
2010.10-10,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2578.487,2582.309,Just -- just -- just assume that we could somehow block out that category.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2596.391,2599.484,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, there would be a massive change."
2010.10-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2604.753,2613.53,"Isn't it -- isn't it true that most States in child support cases, when the defendant says I have no money, will appoint counsel?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2613.53,2617.252,"That is not true of most States, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.619,2708.202,I thought the point was it's only if the defendant -- the complaint is only if the defendant does not have keys in his pocket because he has no money.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2733.071,2739.34,"--Yes, Your Honor, but very, very many non-supporting parents protest the same."
2010.10-10,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2745.904,2754.135,"Yes, and I -- and I suppose you could say that in -- in advance that the judge and the appointing authority simply wouldn't know."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2754.135,2755.615,"Exactly, Justice Kennedy."
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2802.811,2818.337,"Counsel, I -- I took the solicitor general's position to be, they may accuse me of not being accurate in what I took their position to be, which is the rule would be simple."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2862.14,2863.187,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2863.187,2863.687,All right.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2916.934,2918.23,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.257,2957.562,"--Mr. Bibas, I have a question about -- about the position of the government in this case."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2984.69,2987.533,"No, Your Honor, that's beyond the question presented."
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.533,2990.792,"Question presented was just whether counsel was necessary, right?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2990.792,2991.842,That's correct.
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.842,3002.245,"And I suppose it's fully within the power of the government to say why, you know, in general counsel is not necessary because these other procedures are good enough."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3010.81,3015.578,"Yes, Your Honor, and as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, that's not what this Court granted certiorari on."
2010.10-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3016.511,3036.975,"What about you -- you stressed that this falls on the civil side, so why shouldn't we take Rule 54(d) as our model say that instructs the court that you give parties the relief to which they are entitled, even if they haven't asked for that relief, even if they've asked for something that they can't get?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3036.975,3041.614,"--Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe this is a question about relief."
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3051.984,3058.086,"I don't know that that answers my question, because the way I phrased the question was very specific."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3088.194,3091.732,"--Your Honor, I respectfully--"
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3091.732,3095.408,Then isn't that an answer to the question presented?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3095.408,3098.251,"--I don't read the question presented that way, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3098.251,3100.177,We can argue about that later.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3100.177,3100.527,Okay.
2010.10-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3100.71,3101.193,Okay.
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.806,3112.63,"I would think that the rule would be that if -- if South Carolina has not complied with minimum due process procedures, minimum due process procedures are required, not counsel is required."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3112.63,3114.176,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3116.352,3118.815,Go back to the -- what happen.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3127.092,3137.749,"Here's what happened, Justice Breyer, the rule to show cause at joint appendix 50 A said in all capital letters, must bring proof of employment."
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.6,3144.897,Did he bring some proof of employment?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3144.897,3146.86,--He did not.
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3146.86,3147.493,All right.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3149.702,3150.352,All right.
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3172.878,3173.628,You mean he didn't believe him about what?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3174.328,3175.804,--That he did not have the money.
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3175.804,3176.337,Okay.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3178.813,3182.571,That's our reading of petition appendix 18A.
2010.10-10,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3182.571,3185.081,"Well, we couldn't really tell, could we, Mr. Bibas?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3203.536,3208.404,"Your Honor, none of those -- you are correct; none of those is filled out."
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3225.542,3226.808,I think actually trying--
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.808,3228.288,I don't understand all of this discussion.
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3235.153,3235.949,--Just out of curiosity--
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.949,3237.596,It is simply whether counsel is necessary.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3240.772,3241.388,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3241.888,3243.864,"--Fine, but I would like to ask a different question."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3267.02,3268.317,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3272.326,3274.039,I understand there was no -- look.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3279.807,3280.853,--Yes.
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3280.853,3286.038,So I'm trying to say: What really differed from what the government wants?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3286.038,3295.565,"Whether in a form or orally, a judge could ask such questions, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out."
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.055,3306.435,"The government is not a party here, is it?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3306.435,3307.285,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3307.285,3308.231,It's just an amicus.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3320.352,3321.064,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3322.114,3322.944,And skip that one.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3354.331,3355.794,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3383.356,3383.706,Okay.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3392.534,3394.96,It -- it is not across the board.
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3394.96,3395.493,And that is the answer?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3396.939,3398.485,We don't have good statistics as to how often.
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3398.485,3398.815,Okay.
2010.10-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3399.781,3403.654,Do you know why we're not hearing from the State of South Carolina?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3403.654,3406.117,Because the state was not a party--
2010.10-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3406.117,3406.58,"No, no."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3412.514,3413.431,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.431,3415.357,Why aren't they defending their procedures?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3415.357,3419.929,Well--
2010.10-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3419.929,3421.558,"It may be an unfair question, since you don't represent the State."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3421.558,3421.842,--Right.
2010.10-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3442.789,3449.787,I think it would be a great financial interest if they have to provide counsel in these thousands and thousands of cases.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3449.787,3456.205,"That is a -- that is a broader systemic interest, and the State did, in fact, join an amicus brief to that effect in this case."
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.205,3459.13,Could I ask a question about your mootness point?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3459.13,3459.51,Yes.
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.51,3471.214,"You say it's not capable of repetition, and yet evading review, because should this happen again, he could get a stay, as he could have gotten in this case."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3496.0,3500.555,The closest is this Court's decision in St. Pierre.
2010.10-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3503.647,3510.795,"But it can't possibly be true, because we have cases applying the rule that this is capable of repetition, yet evading review."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3513.888,3515.451,"They -- no, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3561.701,3572.571,"Do we have any -- any computation about what it would be, what the counsel fee would be as opposed to keeping someone in prison for a year?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3572.571,3580.385,"We don't have those numbers, but I also believe that's not the correct inquiry, Your Honor, because it's not just the few people who are confined."
2010.10-10,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3625.735,3628.077,But there are things that -- did anybody look at housing courts?
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3639.447,3648.225,"We haven't looked at that, Your Honor, and I'm sure the same arises in administrative appeals and small claims court, any number of places."
2010.10-10,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3659.148,3664.553,"There are things the judge could have asked, though, and put on the record, and it might have cleared this up."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3695.971,3703.285,"Yes, Your Honor, and whether that's salutary or ought to be considered in a future case, it's not the question here."
2010.10-10,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3710.636,3717.2,It's a little difficult to write the opinion if you are to prevail.
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3735.005,3739.728,"--I don't believe this Court has to do that, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3755.736,3759.079,"Well, then you do think we should lay out the factors, and if so what are the factors?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3759.079,3768.486,--I -- I don't believe that it's necessary because we can't conceive of a legal issue here so complex that categorically a lawyer is necessary.
2010.10-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3768.486,3781.902,"Counsel, I don't understand how we could say that if you do not meet minimum due process procedures, you must meet more than minimum due process procedures."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3802.299,3803.249,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-10,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3824.492,3829.761,"Well, I -- I just don't know that all those things are properly before us."
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3829.761,3838.075,"Well, then, the appropriate thing is to answer the question that was raised by Petitioner in this case and not to go -- no need to go beyond that I would suggest."
2010.10-10,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3861.945,3868.563,"Practically when those forms are used, the person fills out a form, and mostly they're just accepted, aren't they?"
2010.10-10,2,41097,stephanos_bibas,,3868.563,3871.305,"--Your Honor, I don't believe they're rubber stamped."
