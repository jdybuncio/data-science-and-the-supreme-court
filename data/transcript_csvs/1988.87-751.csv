1988.87-751,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,0.0,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-751, Frank C. Carlucci v. John Doe."
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,0.0,3.285,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,200.462,207.135,What authority was the Secretary... or the agency acting under at this stage?
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,207.135,209.051,They were acting under dual authority.
1988.87-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,213.289,221.395,"Yes, but when the... when the agency first took action against him and started this procedure, what did it purport to act under?"
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,221.395,229.548,It was acting under its statutory authority to hire employees without regard to the Civil Service laws.
1988.87-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,237.07,243.824,And you say that that gave the agency the power to fire too.
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,243.824,244.424,--That's correct.
1988.87-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.61,249.045,And the agency had issued regulations?
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,249.045,250.178,--Yes.
1988.87-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,257.984,259.451,And that is what they were acting under?
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,260.27,260.636,--That's correct.
1988.87-751,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.231,286.837,"Mr. Kellogg, would you tell me what is the NSA regulation that required that the removal be for cause?"
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,286.837,289.622,Chapter 370--
1988.87-751,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,289.622,290.589,It's 370.
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,290.589,299.811,--of the NSA regulations says that removals are to be for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.
1988.87-751,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.811,303.013,And is that... is 370 in the appendix of the cert petition?
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,303.013,304.215,"Yes, it is."
1988.87-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.215,319.475,"Mr. Kellogg, doesn't Chapter 371 of the regulations say that it applies to actions to limit access to classified information and to suspend or terminate personnel for reasons of national security?"
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,319.475,320.591,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.591,328.33,"It looked to me reading through it, frankly, like this was a 371 proceeding or should have been."
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,336.334,338.286,"No, they were not, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-751,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.85,360.116,Then it becomes cause.
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,360.116,367.871,And then it becomes cause because possession of a clearance is a statutory requirement of employment at NSA.
1988.87-751,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.452,393.856,"I was a little troubled because reading the regulations, it did seem to me that they just didn't follow their own regulations."
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,393.856,395.073,"Well, I think that's not correct."
1988.87-751,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.637,428.391,"So, you say this is not a national security case as defined in the preamble to the regulations."
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,428.391,429.591,That's correct.
1988.87-751,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.634,520.767,"Mr. Kellogg, may I ask you another question?"
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,523.836,524.686,That's correct.
1988.87-751,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.686,527.804,Does it... is every 7532 suspension one without pay?
1988.87-751,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,527.804,530.858,"Well, I don't think it would have to be."
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1140.311,1152.302,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1988.87-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.462,1279.401,"But before that carries the day for you, you've got to show that 7532 is the exclusive provision for removal."
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1279.401,1281.218,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.635,1310.254,And you'll tell us why I suppose.
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1310.254,1310.937,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.937,1313.706,Certainly the plain language of 7532 doesn't say that.
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1319.524,1321.11,"Then it starts with suspension, Your Honor."
1988.87-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.11,1322.86,--Suspension without pay.
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1322.86,1323.176,And suspension is discretionary.
1988.87-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.176,1323.71,Right.
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1323.71,1328.697,"But then it gets to but when there's removal, the employee is entitled."
1988.87-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.697,1335.953,"But that's an employee suspended under Subsection (a) of this section, so forth and so on, is entitled."
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1335.953,1337.286,Well--
1988.87-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.286,1340.322,That's the only mandatory language I see.
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1340.322,1350.795,"--Well, we respectfully say that this... if it is in the interest of national security, this is the only option if it's truly an interest of national security case."
1988.87-751,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.795,1351.645,I understand that's your position.
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1354.447,1364.52,"Well, we point out in the... most of our record references are to the Court of Appeals' appendix, which we understand has been filed with the Clerk and circulated to the Justices."
1988.87-751,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.895,1429.312,Excuse me.
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1433.283,1434.499,--This is not in the petition.
1988.87-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.761,1536.981,--But is there any contest about the revocation of his security clearance?
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1538.331,1539.183,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.133,1545.921,"So, this isn't... this isn't a proceeding in which it was sought to take away his security clearance."
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1545.921,1548.789,"--Well, it's unclear."
1988.87-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1564.815,1570.219,"Well, did he argue in these proceedings that his security clearance shouldn't have been revoked?"
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1570.219,1571.321,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.254,1575.29,And was this the proper forum in which he should argue that?
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1575.29,1581.844,"Well, we contend that there should have been 371 rights that gave us these rights plus appeal to the Secretary of Defense."
1988.87-751,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.844,1583.046,That's under--
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1583.046,1583.379,He was cut off.
1988.87-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1591.866,1601.424,"--You would have had on top of this... if the agency said your security clearance is revoked, then you're going to have a 7532 hearing."
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1601.424,1602.224,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-751,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1602.224,1607.494,"And in which that decision to revoke will be relitigated, wouldn't it?"
1988.87-751,1,30449,john_g_gill_jr,,1607.494,1609.427,"""Reviewed and readjudicated"" in the words of the executive order."
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2924.48,2940.156,"In the Court's decision in Cole v. Young, the Court compared 7532... situations in which use of that statute was appropriate with ordinary removal procedures."
1988.87-751,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.466,2990.655,"Part of Mr. Gill's argument, Mr. Kellogg, is that even if you could have proceeded under one of these other provisions, you didn't."
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3003.565,3009.469,--I think actually the agency was very careful in choosing the procedures that it followed here.
1988.87-751,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.937,3068.821,But it's also true that Section 371 in its introductory sentence says:
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3081.212,3091.004,"It would only support the proponent's... the opponent's view if it followed that once you revoke a clearance, you have to continue and can only use Section 7532."
1988.87-751,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.619,3121.689,"So, are you saying that insofar as they went through the revocation of access procedure, they did follow 371?"
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3125.058,3125.741,That's correct.
1988.87-751,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3143.416,3153.058,"You maintain that you carefully tailored it for 371, but you never mention 371."
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3153.058,3155.76,We carefully tailored it for 370.
1988.87-751,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.76,3159.212,"Well, did you carefully not mention 371?"
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3159.212,3164.866,I don't recall if 371 is specifically mentioned.
1988.87-751,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3167.901,3169.817,He said it wasn't mentioned.
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3169.817,3171.4,That's true.
1988.87-751,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3207.09,3216.846,"Yes, but unfortunately this combination of 370 and 371 is contradicted by the very first section of 371 which reads:"
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3245.898,3247.817,That's correct.
1988.87-751,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.817,3249.5,--this thing says it's a dichotomy.
1988.87-751,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3255.804,3256.673,No.
1988.87-751,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3357.686,3359.371,"Thank you, Mr. Kellogg."
