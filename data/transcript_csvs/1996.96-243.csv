1996.96-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.497,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-243, Bernadine Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,11.63,14.243,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-243,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,28.182,32.363,"Well, at the outset, I... and maybe you can answer this question very easily."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,50.067,68.749,"Well, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, of course, is a bi-State body operating under an act of Congress, and the type of proceeding that was initiated here in district court would appear to be specifically authorized under the TRPA compact."
1996.96-243,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,68.749,72.341,Can you bring an inverse suit against the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency?
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,72.341,75.814,"Well, I'm afraid that I can't answer that question, Justice Kennedy."
1996.96-243,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,75.814,77.354,But don't you have to answer it under Williamson?
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,85.089,92.994,Does your... is the thrust of your question going to the second prong of Williamson County regarding the need to pursue State remedies?
1996.96-243,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,92.994,107.754,"--Yes, and these aren't State remedies because it's a bi-State agency, but it still seems to me that to put the case into focus you should go to inverse condemnation first and then 1983 if there's no inverse available."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,107.754,125.505,"Well, the position of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is that they do not have the power of eminent domain, they do not have provisions for paying just compensation, and this entered into the decision that was made at the initial level of this litigation to proceed by way of Federal--"
1996.96-243,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,125.505,125.946,Thank you.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,138.784,142.797,"--I'm not aware of such a practice, certainly not routinely, Justice Kennedy."
1996.96-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.797,143.057,Thank you.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,146.44,147.932,"No, it does not, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.683,184.176,"But it might have relevance as to whether there's a taking, conceivably."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,184.176,189.061,"I don't believe that would be true, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.202,195.213,"Well, but it was true in Penn Central, I guess."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,195.213,202.92,"--Justice O'Connor, I think that the Solicitor General made a... an extremely important distinction in the brief that was filed with this Court."
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.334,259.175,"Well, how were the TDR's obtained in Penn Central?"
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,264.409,270.994,"--The TDR's at issue in Penn Central, Justice O'Connor, of course were not considered relevant to the ripeness issue."
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.006,278.838,But apparently they were considered of relevance in deciding whether there was a taking.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,278.838,281.85,That... that would appear to be correct.
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.37,300.273,They existed when the owner bought the property in question and later sued on it?
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,300.273,311.91,"I could not tell you exactly when Penn Central purchased the property involved and when the New York City zoning ordinance went into effect, but the TDR's were part of the general zoning ordinance."
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.91,322.657,"But in any event, when Mrs. Suitum bought her property the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency was not yet in existence and hadn't developed the TDR?"
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,322.657,329.032,The agency was in existence at the time Mrs. Suitum acquired this property in 1972.
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.199,355.168,"Now, there is some residual value to the extent the property might want to be acquired by a neighbor or someone else to have a larger yard or additional property, I assume."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,355.168,356.119,Justice--
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,356.119,359.762,"There is some value, apparently, remaining for that purpose."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,361.582,362.904,"--I would disagree with that, respectfully, Justice--"
1996.96-243,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.904,364.765,Volleyball and things like that?
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,364.765,366.497,"--Well, I know--"
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.497,367.186,A picnic table?
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,367.186,375.921,--The situation that we have here is an ordinary street with ordinary homes and one vacant lot in the middle of it.
1996.96-243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.515,403.17,"But there was an affidavit backing that up, wasn't there, the Johnson affidavit that said this property has some residual value?"
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,403.17,405.092,"That's true, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-243,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.092,407.352,So the Ninth Circuit had something to go on.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,407.352,413.326,"Well... however, if you look at the evidentiary basis for that affidavit, there were no comparable sales."
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.558,457.025,"Well, suppose we think in fact there is some residual value in what's left for sale for some purpose, obviously less than it would be if a house could be built upon it."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,469.023,473.648,"It would presumably go to the issue of viability for a taking, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,475.859,479.382,"The Ninth Circuit didn't reach any takings question, did they?"
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,479.382,480.269,No.
1996.96-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.269,487.194,They said that under Hamilton County this was simply... you had to pursue further remedies before they would even confront the question.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,487.194,488.766,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.766,491.88,I thought it was your position that it doesn't go to the taking either.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,491.88,492.357,Well--
1996.96-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.357,501.193,"That the criterion is not residual value, but whether there is any economically beneficial use of the land."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,501.193,504.005,"--That, indeed, is our position, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-243,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.245,516.975,Or decides that there may be.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,519.606,520.967,--That's correct.
1996.96-243,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,554.068,560.794,Do we have to say whether it's a Lucas case or a Penn Central case in order for you to prevail on the ripeness claim?
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,560.794,561.134,No.
1996.96-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.911,578.574,Is the TRPA subject to the Administrative Procedure Act?
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,580.397,597.147,"--I know of no ruling to that effect, Your... Mr. Chief Justice, and my assumption would be they are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act which, of course, applied in the Abbott Laboratories case that TRPA now seems to rest its ripeness claims on."
1996.96-243,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,597.147,632.491,"Do I understand the reasoning of the courts below that the lack of ripeness depended not only on the fact that there had not been a final ruling from the county in this... with respect to one of these rights that... the lottery issue, I guess... but that in fact with respect to all of the TDR's collectively there was simply too little known about their actual functioning to assign a market value, and because a market value could not be supplied, that was one of the reasons for saying that the claim was not ripe."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,633.482,639.356,"Justice Souter, that is the interpretation that TRPA places on the decisions below."
1996.96-243,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,691.208,704.278,"I take it it's your position that even if the value of the credits cannot be determined, you are prepared to proceed in this suit and take whatever consequences that fact might produce for you."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,704.278,705.768,"Justice Souter, the answer to that would be yes."
1996.96-243,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,718.187,721.449,And I take it you would say... or maybe you don't say.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,735.097,737.398,"That would be correct, Justice Kennedy."
1996.96-243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.266,816.88,"If you're right, you have a very strong argument that's final and definite."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,843.557,857.537,"Our basic position, Justice Breyer, is that although the value of the credits can easily be determined by the trial court, that in fact is irrelevant to the taking issue, because what these regulations have done--"
1996.96-243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,857.537,859.368,So in other words you're going to send it back and make a legal argument.
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,859.368,859.929,--That's--
1996.96-243,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.929,865.762,"And the legal argument will be on the basis of the record this constitutes a taking, and the other side will say on the basis of the record it doesn't."
1996.96-243,0,40357,r_s_radford,,865.762,866.704,--That's correct--
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1430.281,1431.653,"It's exactly that, Your Honor."
1996.96-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.223,1464.365,Do you think the Administrative Procedure Act applies to the TRPA?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1464.365,1464.896,--No.
1996.96-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.914,1486.11,"So you would apply, say, Abbott Laboratories to an entirely uni-State proceeding if this were just California?"
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1486.11,1487.78,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.615,1499.817,What if the State of California were to take a different position in its administrative procedure rulings?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1499.817,1504.302,"--Well, we're just claiming in terms of Federal jurisdiction, and--"
1996.96-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1504.302,1509.264,So you say the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is governed by Federal law in this respect?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1509.264,1509.465,--No.
1996.96-243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.391,1587.845,"Well, and that sounds eminently reasonable in light of the evidence that we do have in front of us."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1591.16,1603.667,"And we do agree, Your Honor, that the appraisals that are in evidence are very good evidence and they're weighty evidence, but the value of an actual marketing effort for a TDR remains great, and let me explain why."
1996.96-243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1603.667,1606.018,"Well, but I don't see why that's a requirement for ripeness."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1606.018,1606.378,Well--
1996.96-243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1606.378,1618.606,"Maybe the best value of a property is if it's sold, but we have many claims for takings where the property isn't sold, and no court requires it to be sold in order to determine the value."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1618.606,1619.007,--That's right.
1996.96-243,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1619.007,1620.957,So it's a strange argument.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1620.957,1629.423,"Well, Your Honor, this is a unique case, because TDR's... most real property, the value can be readily determined based on appraisals."
1996.96-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.985,1682.109,"Well, but the TDR's in Penn Central were different in that they went to property already owned by the claimant."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1682.109,1683.178,--They didn't have to.
1996.96-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.495,1708.075,"Well, you say they're more flexible, but they also strike me as less usable, since at least the person who owned the property that the TDR applied to could make the judgment do I want to use it, rather than just having to sell it to somebody."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1725.607,1737.604,--The fact that the Court considers the TDR's in the Penn Central case relevant both to the economic impact and considered to be use of the property did not turn on the happenstance that they actually owned some other property nearby.
1996.96-243,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1744.519,1747.559,What... there's a 60-day claims period against TRPA?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1747.559,1750.601,The 60-day claims period would not apply in this case.
1996.96-243,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1760.088,1764.913,How does Mrs. Suitum know when the... even under 1983 the statute runs?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1764.913,1777.582,"--The statute would run in our view, the way we approach the case, that if she identified an interested and eligible buyer, and they had obtained TRPA approval of the transfer, at that point limitations would run."
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.109,1794.963,"Your rules adopted by the association say that you have to bring suit within 60 days, don't they?"
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1794.963,1813.266,"Yes, but those rules... and this has actually been litigated and settled, at least in the Ninth Circuit, that for a 1983 action it's quite consistent, and mandated by this Court's decision in Wilson v. Garcia, that there is a uniform limitations period for all 1983 actions, and you look to the applicable State law, and in this case it would be Nevada."
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1824.355,1841.766,"But I didn't see anywhere in these... I haven't read yet everything, but I didn't see in most of these things any ground that the authority would have to deny approval, assuming that she transferred the rights to a person who was qualified, which any other... so what's left to do?"
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1844.598,1844.938,--Well--
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1844.938,1859.878,"That she's been told at a certain date at that moment you cannot build on this property, and instead, here are some pieces of paper, and they have definite rights in them, and there's nothing more for the agency to do."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1871.028,1891.498,"--Well, one of the factors that would apply in a case like this is the Penn Central factor and the economic impact of the regulation, and until the court has the record fleshed out to make the proper determination of the economic impact, which includes the value of the TDR's, the court... it's just a matter of prudential ripeness considering on the one hand the relative fitness of the issue, and the issue simply is not fit."
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.633,1905.208,"Mr. Lazarus, suppose there's a regular inverse condemnation case, and the plaintiff is saying, you took my land, and I want just compensation."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1933.556,1938.1,It's different from the present case because of the uniqueness of TDR's.
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1939.152,1940.421,"No, but you are creating the uniqueness."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1959.584,1965.717,"--Well, the landowner shouldn't have to wait if there would be any undue hardship, but what you have here is a question for the court."
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.717,1967.239,We don't inquire into hardship in that case.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1977.644,1978.075,"Well, the--"
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.075,1978.946,They don't look into hardship.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1978.946,1980.186,--There are other things at stake here.
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1993.726,2002.232,"I can't think of any ripeness case I've ever read, and maybe you can cite one, but I can't think of any ripeness case I've ever read in which a factor like this made a difference."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2019.863,2020.113,--Well--
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2020.113,2023.146,--this matter isn't ripe?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2023.146,2025.607,--There are not cases involving valuation.
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2025.607,2026.779,"No, but anything like that."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2026.779,2027.647,There are--
1996.96-243,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.647,2028.659,Which case?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2028.659,2050.815,"--Well, there are cases involving the fact the court wants better facts before it to decide, like the Whren v. Geary case, the First Amendment case I believe written by Justice Kennedy involving a First Amendment challenge, and one of the questions... it was a California constitutional provision which made it unlawful for a political party to endorse any candidate for non... a nonpartisan office."
1996.96-243,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2064.572,2072.157,"Mr. Lazarus, on a question of evidence, what these TDR's are worth, it's something that you created."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2102.137,2113.855,"--Well, because she is the plaintiff in this case, and she in effect created the factual uncertainty about these TDR's which prompted the lower court to decide that it needed a better record to decide the case than it had before."
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2113.855,2120.46,Why should we characterize her as creating the uncertainty when it was your agency that created the rights?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2120.46,2121.651,"Well, we created the--"
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2121.651,2124.242,Why blame her rather than your client?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2124.242,2131.946,"--Well, the rights that we created, though, were rights which were very consistent with fairness and justice, and that is in this case we were striving--"
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2131.946,2134.638,"Well, that's kind of the issue here, isn't it?"
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2194.829,2211.921,"--Well, certainly the agency has an interest in a ruling which promotes the creation of this market, but the real, more concrete interest of the agency in this case... because, of course, the only record evidence in this case, the only appraisals are all on our side."
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2221.478,2225.75,But it seems to me quite manipulative for you to say we want to use the courts to create our market.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2229.172,2231.534,It would have... it could have that incidental effect.
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2231.534,2239.779,"If your position is that these are worth something, then that ought to be a market that you've created when you gave her the coupons."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2239.779,2257.64,"Well, Your Honor, that is an incidental, I think positive effect of our position, but I think the main impetus of our position remains the fact that it is in the Government's interest always to have the constitutionality determined based on a fully fleshed-out record."
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.152,2287.78,"But then she could have been able to appeal here on the merits question, which your opposing counsel is urging us to reach but acknowledges we need not reach, and this 6 years of litigation would have been ended that much sooner."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2287.78,2288.311,Well--
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.311,2291.063,This just adds another layer of litigation.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2295.685,2297.217,--I believe she's 82 years old.
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.217,2299.648,And she's been litigating this for 6 years already.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2299.648,2300.419,"Well, Your Honor--"
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.419,2301.889,Do you want to talk about hardship?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2301.889,2302.269,--Well--
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.437,2348.682,How could she... does she have to wait till she wins the lottery?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2351.612,2356.176,"--Under our view, she basically would have to make a good faith effort."
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.176,2357.355,To win the lottery?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2357.355,2361.329,"Well, it's a lottery that we'd all like to apply to, Your Honor."
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.542,2376.278,"She can only sell that particular right if she wins the lottery, so I guess she would have to keep applying until she wins, and then try to sell it and see how much it's worth, and then maybe you discount it by the chances of winning."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2376.278,2376.519,--Well--
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2376.519,2377.47,I don't know.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2377.47,2380.722,"--Yes, well, the record evidence is in 1993 there is--"
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.722,2384.594,"The point is, it's certainly not an easy thing for her to come up with the kind of evaluation--"
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2384.594,2385.745,--Well... well--
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.745,2388.636,"--that you're talking about, and she had no reason to believe you were going to be generous in--"
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2388.636,2390.038,--Your Honor--
1996.96-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.038,2390.878,--saying never mind the lottery.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2390.878,2394.62,"--Because everything is outside the record, there were fewer applicants than allocations."
1996.96-243,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.62,2398.512,"Yes, but it's the case that everybody wins this lottery after 4 or 5 years."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2399.834,2406.939,"Well, at this point there were few... in Washoe County there were fewer applicants than there are allocations, so at this point it's really not--"
1996.96-243,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.939,2409.17,--There's 100 percent chance of winning the lottery?
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2409.17,2420.877,"--Yes, and even if there wasn't, Your Honor, because obviously this could vary depending on the county, all we're asking... all we're basically urging the Court to adopt here is a prudential approach which would be looking at--"
1996.96-243,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2420.877,2428.542,"Mr. Lazarus, I understand the Ninth Circuit didn't, and the Abbott Laboratories is a new creation, and you're talking about balance of hardships."
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2435.217,2439.381,--We think the better way to view the case is in more flexible terms.
1996.96-243,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2449.716,2451.188,But there's also one... I'm sorry.
1996.96-243,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2496.816,2501.881,"--Well, and that's maybe one reason why we think the better way to view the case is in more flexible terms."
1996.96-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.764,2537.953,"Thank you, Mr. Lazarus."
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2540.006,2554.246,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-243,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2572.977,2575.63,"But they're new sticks in the bundle, at least some of them."
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2575.63,2577.82,--They're new sticks in the bundle which--
1996.96-243,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2577.82,2580.491,Is an easement part of the bundle of rights?
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2580.491,2584.205,--It could be if it were transferable.
1996.96-243,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2619.358,2625.8,"If you had two parcels, one with this restriction and one without, which person has the bigger bundle of rights?"
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2629.393,2653.318,"--Well, it is part... in takings analysis, in regulatory takings cases we look to see what economic value has been retained and what economic value has been taken, as well as the purpose of the regulation, interference with reasonable investment-back expectations and the rest of it."
1996.96-243,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2693.954,2709.035,"Well, Mr. Wallace, what if the Government had imposed this same restriction on her, and instead of giving her TDR's had said, we have another piece of property over here that we think is equal to the value we're taking away from you, so here it is."
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2713.389,2717.801,"Well, ripeness is not what I was speaking of at the moment."
1996.96-243,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.602,2719.734,"Well, I thought that's what this case involved."
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2719.734,2756.276,"--Of course it does, and I wanted to get to that, but first we are quite concerned with the per se takings theory under which they are arguing that it's ripe, because it seems to us contrary to this Court's jurisprudence, not only directly contrary to the holding in Penn Central that TDR's count in the takings calculus and are not just to be considered part of compensation, but there's a reason for that holding that has to do with the fact that the TDR's are part of the bundle of rights that an owner of this parcel would get."
1996.96-243,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2756.276,2760.419,But the Court didn't treat Penn Central as a ripeness case at all.
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2761.839,2762.07,Of course.
1996.96-243,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2762.07,2763.051,--and said there was no taking.
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2763.051,2782.953,"Of course, and that is my point, that the Court held there was no taking, and part of the calculus was that the value of the TDR's was retained by the owner, and was something that contributed to market value remaining in that parcel of property."
1996.96-243,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2828.063,2831.626,"Mr. Wallace, let me understand what you're just saying."
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2839.33,2840.682,--That is true.
1996.96-243,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2868.849,2871.531,"Goodness, no court decided that."
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2871.531,2871.811,--Well--
1996.96-243,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2871.811,2875.575,Even taking the evidence introduced by the respondent--
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2875.575,2877.295,--No court has decided--
1996.96-243,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2877.295,2896.408,"--her land was worth more than $100,000 many years ago as a location to build a house, and the evidence introduced by respondent shows that the rights given by the TDR's and the other rights attaching to the property at most would amount to what, $30,000 or something?"
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2896.408,2897.898,"--$35,000, but--"
1996.96-243,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2897.898,2901.401,So we're not going to decide here that that couldn't be a taking.
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2902.192,2902.452,"--Well, there's--"
1996.96-243,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2902.452,2909.636,"I mean, why not give this poor, elderly woman the right to go to court and have her takings claim heard?"
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2909.636,2914.75,--That could be done.
1996.96-243,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2915.32,2917.132,You rely on Abbott Labs.
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2918.692,2919.052,"--Well, what--"
1996.96-243,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.052,2921.295,Abbott Labs is an APA case.
1996.96-243,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2940.587,2943.849,--She is seeking very similar relief in some of her claims.
1996.96-243,3,40357,r_s_radford,,3125.789,3133.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless there are further questions from the Court I have nothing to add."
1996.96-243,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.975,3135.226,Very well.
