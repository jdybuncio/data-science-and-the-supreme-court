1978.77-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.712,We'll hear arguments next in Illinois State Board of Elections against the Socialist Workers Party.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,54.688,57.695,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.326,236.768,Was the case you were referring to as summary affirmance here?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,236.768,238.028,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.028,249.07,"And we've said, haven't we that our summary affirmances are in our own jurisprudence entitled to less weight than are fully written out opinion for the Court?"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,249.07,250.174,"No, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,262.717,286.993,"They do -- all I'm suggesting is that whereas in the -- in Hicks against Miranda, I think we said that they were binding on lower court -- lower federal courts in cases like Edelman against Jordan, we have said they were entitled to some weight but not the same weight that a fully written out opinion would be, would it?"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,286.993,300.979,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as I understand or as appellant is maintaining that perhaps the ratio decidendi or the rule of law which is to be gleaned from a summary affirmance is very difficult in the absence of an opinion."
1978.77-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.844,333.901,But you -- don't you at least agree that the -- that prior summary actions are not entitled to the same way here in this Court?
1978.77-1248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.901,334.283,In other words --
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,334.283,335.435,"In terms of this Court -- yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,335.435,336.666,Even though the lower court --
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,336.666,336.966,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,336.966,339.011,Your hands is bound by it when it gets here --
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,339.011,339.492,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.792,341.284,-- we can ignore it.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,341.284,342.627,Hopefully not.
1978.77-1248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,342.627,343.16,"No, we can't."
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,343.16,343.85,"Yes, you can."
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,344.297,345.513,"Well, we can't."
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,345.513,346.388,But that would --
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.388,347.683,Maybe we're quibbling about words.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,352.133,352.5,You would have to --
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.5,359.183,"-- mention it but it has as my Brother Brennan suggests, less precedential controlling weight here in this Court."
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,359.183,360.387,"Yes in this Court, it does."
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,360.387,362.783,Than a fully developed court opinion --
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,362.783,362.923,That's true.
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,362.923,365.165,-- what the case would have.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,365.165,375.136,"For the appellees to succeed in this case, appellants submit would require overturning the Jackson summary affirmance."
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.136,375.611,Mr. Levinson --
1978.77-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,375.611,385.067,This is based not just on the fact that it is not a fully developed opinion necessarily but this case that hasn't had plenary treatment was full briefing in oral argument in this Court.
1978.77-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,385.067,385.975,It is?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,385.975,386.056,Mr. Chief --
1978.77-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,386.056,386.797,And therefore --
1978.77-1248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,386.797,388.673,Isn't that the case?
1978.77-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,388.673,402.016,"-- well, we can ignore theoretically any opinion of the Court, we give less weight to the summary, dispositions, isn't that the way you read Hicks against Miranda?"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,402.331,424.417,"Mr. Chief Justice, as I read Hicks versus Miranda and the Mandel decision that there is less constraint on this honorable court than to decide otherwise than were the case to receive plenary consideration."
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.977,478.096,"Mr. Levinson, would you help me on that precise point."
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,494.587,495.96,"Yes it was, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.96,497.838,But you didn't quote that part in your brief.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,508.566,512.615,"As I recall Your Honor, in our briefs we do maintain that the issue was presented to this --"
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.615,517.57,"You say that but you don't cite anything in the jurisdictional statement that supports your statement, that's what puzzled me."
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,517.57,517.937,I see.
1978.77-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.03,520.702,Just one sentence (Voice Overlap)?
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,520.702,521.861,What part of your brief?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,521.861,523.102,"No, it's more than one sentence."
1978.77-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.277,525.445,The lower --
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.445,526.146,Are you --
1978.77-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.146,533.522,"-- the District Court here said there was only one sentence and that it -- that -- and it was only a passing mention, wasn't discussed, etcetera."
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,533.522,558.452,"Yes, that with all due respect to the lower court I think that is not a totally accurate statement because in the later opinion of the Court he says, well it was mentioned in passing in a brief but attached is appendix D to the U.S. Labor Party's brief is the memorandum of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and this Court will note that it's more just one sentence."
1978.77-1248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.452,558.904,Yes.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,558.904,561.015,It's a significant argument.
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,569.898,570.576,"Mr. Levinson, --"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,570.576,570.667,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.667,573.304,-- it's really quite important that I do know exactly what you're relying on.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,577.173,577.221,Yes.
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.221,582.096,"It was an argument made in the United States District Court, is that as I understand it correctly?"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,582.096,582.844,"Yes, but this was --"
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.844,587.695,Was there anything -- what was argued in this Court and that it was the same argument that was being made here today?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,587.695,602.303,"Well, this Court did not grant plenary consideration therefore the jurisdictional statement which contained the memorandum of the Attorney General was an issue presented based on the doctrines of this Court in Hicks and Mandel if it's an issue which has been presented to this Court."
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,602.303,602.521,Who commence --
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,602.521,603.381,The lower courts are bound by --
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.381,608.514,-- the argument in this Court that your opponents now rely on?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,608.514,609.327,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.327,615.457,Who advanced the argument in this Court in Jackson against Ogilvie that your opponents now rely on?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,615.457,621.881,The appellants Jackson attached the memorandum of the Attorney General to his jurisdictional statement because the Attorney --
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,621.881,626.986,Then he make the argument other than attaching a document that shows it was argued in the District Court?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,627.614,627.995,There was no oral --
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.995,629.054,-- in this Court?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,629.054,631.144,"Well, by attaching it to the jurisdictional --"
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,631.144,633.992,That's -- that's the extent of the argument that was made in the other case.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,633.992,635.711,"Well, cause no plenary consideration was given."
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.711,638.312,Well but -- alright.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,638.312,638.347,Since no --
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.347,638.805,But that is the sentence?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,638.805,642.196,"-- plenary consideration was given, the only way it could be presented to the Court, we --"
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.196,648.565,I suppose the argument could have been advanced in jurisdictional statement itself and said we think the decision is wrong for this reason.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,648.565,648.745,"Well, there --"
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.745,650.321,"But that was not done, as I understand it."
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,650.321,651.513,There was a crossover.
1978.77-1248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,686.055,690.877,I just don't understand if that's clear why you didn't quote any of these in your brief.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,692.053,694.665,"We did mention, as I recall in our brief Your Honor."
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,873.444,882.215,"You're not arguing for consideration of the second issue that the Court of Appeals considered the agreement between the labor party and the Chicago Board, are you?"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,882.215,891.004,We are arguing that the doctrine of mootness has been given lip service by the lower courts but that the issue was not moot and that it should be remanded.
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.004,900.471,"But to say -- unless I am -- got the wrong brief here or something, this -- that the Seventh Circuit did hold that part of the case was moot."
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,900.471,901.277,That's right.
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.277,903.687,And you don't disagree with that holding?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,903.687,904.469,"Yes, we do."
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,934.244,936.942,"But the Seventh Circuit found otherwise, didn't it?"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,936.942,939.688,This did not resolve the issue on the ground of mootness.
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,941.049,944.754,"One, did they -- did not resolve the substance of the issue because they --"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,944.754,945.097,That's correct.
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,945.097,946.528,-- concluded it was moot.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,946.528,947.238,That's correct sir.
1978.77-1248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.238,958.006,And isn't there are some reason for us thinking that the Seventh Circuit probably knows what the Cook County Board of Elections might do in the future better than we do?
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,958.006,959.205,"No, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,982.272,983.621,"Oh, Mr. Levinson, if --"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,983.621,983.828,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,983.828,997.276,-- we agree with you that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit was in error in considering this second issue moot then we should do no more than on that branch of the case remand it to the Court of Appeals --
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,997.276,997.436,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,997.436,998.59,"-- for decision of the merits, is that right?"
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,998.59,999.246,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,999.246,1001.029,We shouldn't attempt to decide the merits here.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,1001.029,1001.73,Right sir.
1978.77-1248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1001.73,1002.528,Right.
1978.77-1248,0,36233,michael_l_levinson,,1002.528,1005.41,May I reserve the rest of time for rebuttal sir.
1978.77-1248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1005.41,1007.662,Very well.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1023.763,1026.922,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.432,1114.827,Are you not reading from 19 (a)?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1114.827,1115.856,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1115.856,1117.049,About where on the page?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1117.049,1119.161,"Oh, about a third of the way down."
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1119.161,1119.456,Alright.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1119.456,1120.498,Two-fifths the way down.
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1120.498,1122.038,Alright.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1122.038,1134.547,It is most respectfully suggested that this Court might properly look to and reasonably rely upon the response and pleadings and memorandum of law filed by the Attorney General.
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.27,1169.66,"Yes, but that's been in dissent primarily, hasn't it?"
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1169.66,1179.494,That's been in a concurring opinion in Mandel versus Bradley and in Mandel versus Bradley the majority per curiam opinion supports that position as well.
1978.77-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1179.494,1184.925,"Well, unless it's a five to four decision per curiam opinions don't carry any weights."
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1184.925,1201.701,"We would submit also that in Hicks versus Miranda, the opinion of Mr. Justice White in which he indicates that those issues properly presented to this Court are the issues that are binding on lower courts insofar as summary affirmances are concerned."
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.58,1218.189,Which is what do you think?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1218.189,1247.504,"Which is whether Sections 10-2 and 10-3 of the Illinois Election Code which require local candidates in Chicago and Cook County who are independents or new political parties to obtain far in excess of 25,000 signatures to obtain ballot placement as opposed to a maximum 25,000 signature requirement for all other elections in State of Illinois."
1978.77-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.926,1274.092,Do you have to split them up among counties?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1274.092,1274.895,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.895,1278.089,"So that you could get 25,000 signatures in Cook County."
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1278.089,1279.472,"The reality -- yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1248,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1309.807,1313.923,I take it that Cook County is only Illinois county in which this could happen.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1313.923,1315.8,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.811,1338.871,Is that Rockford or Winnebago County?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1338.871,1340.578,That's in Rockford City.
1978.77-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.29,1346.115,Is Rockford bigger than Peoria?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1346.115,1346.327,Excuse me?
1978.77-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.327,1347.706,Is Rockford bigger than Peoria?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1347.706,1361.642,"That's according to the 1970 census, Your Honor which is the official census by which they go in 1970 Rockford had 31,000 votes cast for Mayor and that was the second highest vote at that time."
1978.77-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.195,1371.425,"Well, let me go back once more if I may to pages 19 (a) and appendix D."
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1385.337,1385.82,I --
1978.77-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.82,1386.143,What?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1386.143,1386.893,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1978.77-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1444.25,1446.411,It does state this -- a similar argument then they break of --
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1446.411,1447.945,It alludes to it Your Honor.
1978.77-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.945,1452.198,But what was -- where did it -- it was -- appendix D actually an appendix to the jurisdictional statement filed?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1452.198,1453.657,It's my understanding that it was.
1978.77-1248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.657,1454.915,I see.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1459.274,1478.268,"I stated earlier that in our view and as well in the view of the District Court and the Court of Appeals that this classification which requires independents and new political parties in Chicago and Cook County to obtain more than 25,000 signatures is irrational."
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.755,1516.778,"Well, is your argument here limited to the comparison with statewide offices?"
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1516.778,1518.495,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.495,1527.57,"Absent to 25,000 signature limit for -- in other situations, would you be here or?"
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1527.57,1529.27,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.27,1537.242,You don't think the 5% requirement on its face or in the context of Illinois politics is unreasonably burdensome?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1537.242,1542.411,We thought that it was within the context of the special mayoral election held last year.
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.411,1544.549,Just being -- but not generally.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1544.549,1546.071,Generally this Court has upheld that.
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.902,1553.954,Here you had only 81 days.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1553.954,1554.525,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.525,1558.812,But you're not arguing that here -- you're not supporting the judgment on that ground here?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1558.812,1560.262,That's not crucial to the Court.
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.362,1572.374,"Well, I thought that that is what you concede was decided in Jackson against Ogilvie."
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1572.374,1576.801,That was decided in Jackson versus Ogilvie Your Honor within the context of a general election.
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1576.801,1577.183,Yes.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1577.183,1577.778,And if I may just --
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1577.778,1581.381,Which is simply an attack on the 5% requirement as such.
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.381,1583.055,But there you had an unlimited amount of time --
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1583.055,1583.54,That's correct.
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.54,1585.909,-- to get the signatures and here only 81 days.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1585.909,1592.378,If I want to run for Mayor of the City of Chicago in 1999 I can go out and start collecting my signatures tomorrow.
1978.77-1248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.378,1593.281,Do you expect to do that?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1593.281,1598.662,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.57,1743.766,"It could -- suppose we disagreed -- well, I'll put it this way, did the Court of Appeals relied it all on the just as your burdensome in El Salvador, was the -- was it -- was this principal ground or the only ground the comparison?"
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1743.766,1755.113,"The Court of Appeals adopted the equal protection analysis that the District Court engaged in and that was limited essentially to the disparity between 25,000 statewide --"
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.113,1756.629,So what if we disagreed with you?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1762.312,1762.844,We would agree --
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.844,1765.267,We wouldn't decide -- we wouldn't decide that issue here.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1765.267,1770.669,"Well, we would agree that it was burdensome given the factual context, the limited number of time."
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.669,1772.253,"Well, you would argue it was burdensome."
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1773.258,1773.986,I'm sorry.
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.981,1780.76,"But -- but to that issue, I would suppose it should be decided in the first instance in the lower courts, shouldn't it?"
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1780.76,1784.533,That was the issue that we entered into a settlement agreement on Your Honor.
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.646,1788.375,I know but there's a permanent injunctions outstanding.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1788.375,1790.4,That's correct and the permanent injunction says --
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.4,1799.814,And the question is should the permanent injunction be outstanding for a reason other than the reason given in the lower courts?
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1799.814,1800.957,It should not if this Court --
1978.77-1248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.957,1804.0,"Oh, I know but shouldn't it be decided there first?"
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1811.722,1812.922,"The -- no, you should not."
1978.77-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.426,1848.815,"Mr. Colman, under our practice, isn't it usual if a Court of Appeals decides that an issue decided by a District Court is moot we don't simply dismiss the appeal but we direct that the complaint be dismissed?"
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1848.815,1856.89,In this case Your Honor the only thing that was found to be moot by the Court of Appeals was the settlement agreement.
1978.77-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.666,1877.104,"Well, but this is half the case."
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1887.955,1889.285,That's correct.
1978.77-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.285,1892.932,-- but in -- because of the agreement that it had been entered into.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1892.932,1897.639,Because the election had passed because this as an agreement entered --
1978.77-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.639,1902.435,Simply because the election had passed and the usual capable of repetition principle didn't apply here.
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1902.435,1903.753,That's correct.
1978.77-1248,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.753,1911.11,"Well then why shouldn't it have remanded with instructions to dissolve the injunction, dismiss the complaint as to that aspect of the case?"
1978.77-1248,1,29745,jeffrey_d_colman,,1911.11,1925.167,"It could have remanded with instructions to dissolve settlement agreement, the order entered in March 17th but that order itself says that it applies only to the June 1977 election."
1978.77-1248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1943.629,1946.363,Very well.
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,1950.62,1954.895,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.426,1981.146,"Well now, do you suggest that that issue decided in the Court of Appeals?"
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,1981.146,1982.355,No.
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.291,1988.171,Are you saying that we should decide it if we were to reject the equal protection argument?
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,1988.171,1996.193,I'm saying if this Court decides to reject the equal protection argument that it can be decided on its face.
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.193,1997.79,"Well, I know we could but the --"
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,1997.79,1998.445,And sure with this case.
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.445,2004.182,-- half of that -- a good part of that kind of a judgment is some feel for local politics.
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2004.182,2030.821,"I think Your Honor that the 20th -- the history of the application of the 25,000 signature requirement on a statewide basis provides this Court with ample basis for determining that given the effectiveness of the 25,000 signature requirement that the additional burden in light of the significance of that burden would be clearly unnecessary."
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.821,2037.885,"Well, but the party has seemed to have been unable to satisfy it on prior occasions."
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2037.885,2038.473,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.473,2043.222,"The 5%, they've been able to -- its not -- hasn't been -- it hasn't prove them practical, has it?"
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2043.222,2046.472,"Your Honor, in Cook County it has proved the impossible."
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.768,2156.977,What do you --
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2156.977,2158.175,There is no reason for --
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.175,2170.762,What do you understand to be the justification offered by the state for a greater signature requirement in Cook County elections?
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2170.762,2172.005,None whatsoever.
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.225,2207.02,But you don't understand this -- you don't under --
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2207.02,2207.446,-- history.
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.446,2210.168,-- you don't understand the state ever do have said anymore than that.
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2210.168,2214.332,They -- I do not understand them to have ever said any more than that.
1978.77-1248,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.332,2214.41,In fact the record --
1978.77-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.41,2222.473,Maybe an independent candidate in Cook County just needs a lot bigger base of support than a statewide candidate.
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2222.473,2228.972,He may need a lot bigger base of support to win but it doesn't need a bigger base of support to become a legitimate candidate.
1978.77-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2252.471,2280.323,Could a state say that in a large county we have the hypothetically two well-established political machines of the regular parties and an independent just doesn't have much of a chance there and so we're going to require more for him run in that particular county or city than we would statewide where he -- independent has a much larger base to draw on statewide.
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2280.323,2281.133,"Well, --"
1978.77-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.133,2285.34,It maybe a rather cynical approach but could a state say that for constitutional purposes?
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2285.34,2287.178,I don't think so because it is cynical.
1978.77-1248,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.707,2309.478,But those could be both cynical and real.
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2309.478,2322.087,"Well, I don't see any relationship between any of the interest that this Court has indicated, our legitimate state interest which justified burdening the fundamental rights at issue here."
1978.77-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.579,2331.859,Mr. Reosti.
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2331.859,2333.541,I don't think the Court has ever gone that far.
1978.77-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.541,2340.311,"Mr. Reosti, if I may ask a background question, when did this discrepancy in the statute arise?"
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2343.045,2345.149,It's read this way since 1931.
1978.77-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.372,2355.115,And that you should (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2355.115,2357.286,"-- they've kept it, they've kept the 25,000."
1978.77-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.286,2365.417,"It's also rather interesting that now I'm seeing this appendix D again, the Governor of Illinois and the Attorney General of Illinois took the position the statute was unconstitutional (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2365.417,2366.179,That's correct.
1978.77-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.179,2366.863,-- didn't they?
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2366.863,2366.939,That's correct.
1978.77-1248,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.939,2368.675,My Brother remarked of.
1978.77-1248,2,40331,ronald_reosti,,2368.675,2371.266,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1248,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2373.216,2373.828,Very well.
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2375.653,2378.765,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1248,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.699,2410.472,"But to resolve the statute is that in Cook County, you need more signatures to run as a countywide candidate than you do to run in the State of Illinois as a statewide candidate."
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2413.437,2420.256,If -- I suggest that some historical staging is necessary in terms of a justification.
1978.77-1248,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.122,2500.885,You say if the Courts had simply let the legislative plan alone from the beginning it would be a lot more rational than it is now?
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2500.885,2506.73,"Well, I believe Justice -- Mr. Justice -- oh, I better not guess."
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.68,2551.924,"Well, do -- you think you just have to go about it in by percentages?"
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2551.924,2563.932,"Yes, I think if the general assembly had struck 25,000 and made 5% the minimum signature requirement for statewide candidates, we wouldn't be here today based Jenness, based on the recent decisions of this Court."
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.932,2569.141,"I know but the state has and it said 25,000 is enough for statewide."
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2569.141,2570.074,That's right.
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.074,2573.049,And now why isn't that enough in Cook County?
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2573.049,2574.261,Because in all other areas --
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.261,2576.81,What justification do you have for the distinction?
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2576.81,2580.608,I have no justification other than there were two different legislative schemes.
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.058,2586.073,And a percentage.
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2586.073,2586.805,And a percentage.
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.709,2589.923,Yes.
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2589.923,2593.99,"-- units to local government, and townships and counties, it was 5%."
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.182,2603.655,How long was the 5% requirement been?
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2603.655,2605.149,It's been there a number of years.
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.718,2609.52,What was the 1931 date that someone mentioned?
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2609.52,2611.321,"That was the 25,000 signature requirement."
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.321,2613.332,And -- and has the 5% been as --
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2613.332,2614.796,"Almost as long, yes sir?"
1978.77-1248,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2614.796,2615.162,"Well, Mr. Levinson (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.162,2621.427,What would have been -- what would have been -- how many signatures would the 5% have amounted to in 1931?
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2621.427,2622.356,I don't have those figures.
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.225,2624.846,It might have been less --
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2624.846,2624.914,Yes.
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.914,2625.917,-- than 25.
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2625.917,2626.608,It might have been.
1978.77-1248,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2629.512,2634.016,"Now my question was that the -- all this time, the legislature has been meeting they could change it."
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2634.016,2635.812,They could've changed and they could've increased it.
1978.77-1248,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2635.812,2641.093,"They could have prevented us from destroying it all, did they?"
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2641.093,2642.238,That's true.
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.466,2673.471,What was your position in Jackson v. Ogilvie?
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2673.471,2674.56,We were not created.
1978.77-1248,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.522,2677.946,But what -- did the state take a position?
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2677.946,2678.251,Yes.
1978.77-1248,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.91,2726.762,But you're telling us that no hardship was shown then.
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2726.762,2727.272,Exactly.
1978.77-1248,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2727.272,2729.084,No basis for any conclusion on that.
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2729.084,2729.402,Right.
1978.77-1248,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2750.701,2755.444,"Incidentally, I was a dissenter in Moore against Ogilvie, I --"
1978.77-1248,3,36233,michael_l_levinson,,2755.444,2757.512,"Yes, I wanted to use your dissent."
1978.77-1248,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2759.016,2760.877,Mr. Justice Harlan was showing me --
