1985.84-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.32,We will hear arguments first this morning in Regents of the University of Michigan against Ewing.
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,12.891,17.193,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,62.49,65.275,May I ask why you make that assumption?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,65.275,66.392,"--Because, Justice Powell--"
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,66.392,68.558,"You don't concede it, do you?"
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,68.558,84.937,--I just assume it as the Court did in Horowitz because I believe it is not essential to reach that issue in order to decide this case on the narrower ground of whether Mr. Ewing was treated by the University in an arbitrary and capricious way.
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,84.937,88.305,"So, you simply make an assumption?"
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,88.305,95.042,I am assuming for the purposes of the argument the existence of the protectable property interest.
1985.84-1273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,95.042,98.261,What if we disagree with you on your argument though?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,103.731,105.517,"Most certainly not, Justice White."
1985.84-1273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,114.206,124.495,"Well, I know, but what if we agree with the Court of Appeals that if there is a property interest there was a constitutional violation?"
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,124.495,128.114,"--Then, of course, I suppose you would have to affirm."
1985.84-1273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,128.114,132.6,Because you are not going to argue about the property interest issue.
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,132.6,152.662,"I must say, Justice White, that the idea of arguing the property interest has some appeal for me and the idea that there should not be a property interest in such as thing as a course grade or a qualification, an academic qualification."
1985.84-1273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,152.662,158.066,You didn't present the property interest question in your petition.
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,158.066,158.949,That is correct.
1985.84-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.949,163.536,"Well, no, I am not sure I agree with Justice White on that."
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,178.812,184.033,"Clearly it is within the parameters of the question as framed in the petition, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,184.033,185.735,"You are not going to present it though, is that right?"
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,185.735,186.418,I agree.
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,186.418,189.437,The Solicitor General said he thought the question was in the case.
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,189.437,197.709,"Yes, and the Solicitor General's position, Justice Powell, is, as I said, quite attractive to me."
1985.84-1273,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.318,218.372,"Well, maybe we think it is narrower to decide it on whether it is property."
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,218.372,222.241,"--Very well, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1273,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.241,236.299,What is the agreement or the understanding that students have who are admitted to the Medical School in your state?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,236.299,252.176,"The understanding that they have, Justice O'Connor, is that they should be permitted to proceed in the program while they are meeting the requirements of the Medical School's faculty, while they are on what I termed a minute ago good academic behavior."
1985.84-1273,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.176,260.58,Are there provisions in the application forms that make it a matter of discretion of the faculty to retain the student?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,260.58,300.657,"In the official bulletins of the Medical School, Justice O'Connor... I am referring now to Exhibits 36 and 39, which are the two bulletins which were effective at the time Mr. Ewing matriculated and at the time he flunked out... there are clear provisions conferring upon the Promotion Board's discretion to pass, to fail, or to take any one of many intermediate actions between those two extremes with respect to the enrolled students, yes."
1985.84-1273,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,459.359,461.477,Where is Mr. Ewing now?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,461.477,470.833,"He is in Chicago, I am informed by Counsel, enrolled in the Chicago College of Osteopathy, Justice Blackmun."
1985.84-1273,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,470.833,473.869,I take it there is no racial overtone in this case?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,473.869,478.571,None whatsoever.
1985.84-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.802,525.652,May I just ask you one question at this point.
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,525.652,526.337,--Certainly.
1985.84-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.337,527.97,What is all of this relevant to?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,533.324,533.724,Well--
1985.84-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.724,536.11,What is the legal point you are making?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,537.176,546.065,--The legal point is the care and deliberation which went into the decision to terminate.
1985.84-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.065,547.833,"But, they didn't have to do any of that, did they?"
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,547.833,551.285,"No, they didn't as a matter of law."
1985.84-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.321,561.843,How does that go to the question of what they were required to do which is really what we are interested in.
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,561.843,582.923,"It goes to the admonition of this Court in Board of Curators v. Horowitz, I believe, Your Honor, that a careful and deliberate decision made by professional decision makers such as those on Michigan's faculty should not be reviewed by the courts."
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,582.923,589.41,"Mr. Daane, this suit is against the State of Michigan, isn't it?"
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,589.41,591.91,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,591.91,594.195,Did you consider the Eleventh Amendment issue?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,594.195,596.647,"Yes, we have argued them on brief."
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,596.647,598.13,Are you going to argue that?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,598.13,600.532,"I hadn't intended to today, Your Honor."
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,600.532,602.151,You rest on your briefs?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,602.151,604.034,"I would rest on the briefs, yes."
1985.84-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,604.034,608.055,Do you think we have jurisdiction?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,608.055,610.489,Yes.
1985.84-1273,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,714.641,726.865,"On the Eleventh Amendment issue, there is a motion, as I understand it, by the Respondent to be allowed to amend the complaint now to name the Regents individually."
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,726.865,727.999,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1273,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,727.999,729.384,To try to meet that issue.
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,732.202,745.61,"We did not file a response to that motion, Justice O'Connor, and my candid opinion is that it really doesn't change the applicability of the Eleventh Amendment defense, because the motion--"
1985.84-1273,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.61,751.33,Do you think if they were named individually that you could still argue the Eleventh Amendment defense?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,751.33,757.301,"--Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor, because the motion does not seek to name them in their individual capacities."
1985.84-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,770.744,780.083,Do I understand you to say you believe that you can amend a complaint in this Court?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,780.083,780.516,Respondent--
1985.84-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.516,782.118,Are you willing to let that out?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,782.118,786.737,--Respondent appears to be of that opinion.
1985.84-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,786.737,789.039,"Well, do you agree with him or not?"
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,789.039,792.574,"Well, I think it is very late in the day, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,792.574,794.259,Do you agree with it or not?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,794.259,796.545,"We did not oppose it, therefore--"
1985.84-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,796.545,797.728,Do you agree with it?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,797.728,798.595,--Yes.
1985.84-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,798.595,799.247,You agree with it?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,799.247,800.18,Yes.
1985.84-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,800.18,803.699,Will you give me one precedent?
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,803.699,811.971,"Hutto... I don't mean to be arguing Respondent's case, but he cited--"
1985.84-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.971,817.624,You are as responsible for jurisdiction as he is.
1985.84-1273,0,39036,roderick_k_daane,,817.624,822.742,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1397.163,1400.517,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.176,1446.211,Do those rules kind of amount to a contract in your view?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1446.211,1447.145,"Yes, they do."
1985.84-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.113,1476.065,"And, then what, do the federal courts simply apply Michigan contract law?"
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1476.065,1482.402,"Under Sindermann and all the cases, Your Honor, the issue is where there is a property interest we look to state law."
1985.84-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.074,1494.459,It is based on an agreement between the Regents and the--
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1494.459,1504.167,"We have cited many cases in our brief, Your Honor, which suggests, under various states, that the relationship between a student and a university is contractual."
1985.84-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1504.167,1511.321,"--Is there a federal parole evidence rule, a federal statute of frauds to govern these kinds of contractual claims?"
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1511.321,1517.225,"Well, Your Honor, as you know, under Sindermann, it doesn't even have to rise to the level of an actual conflict."
1985.84-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.299,1534.25,But here I thought you said the federal court just to apply Michigan law.
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1534.25,1537.186,"The Michigan law being Your Honor, whether there is a property interest."
1985.84-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.046,1557.033,"That is slicing it awfully thin, isn't it, the distinction between federal law and state law?"
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1557.033,1566.722,"Your Honor, I think it is well grounded in the precedents of this Court that there isn't any federal notion of a property interest, that the federal notion of a property interest must look to state law."
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1583.033,1596.391,Have the Michigan courts addressed the nature of the interest at the Medical School at the University under the kind of admission policies that are written in the application?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1596.391,1600.712,"--Your Honor, I think the courts have addressed it in this sense."
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1608.433,1610.535,What rule are you talking about?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1610.535,1616.488,I am talking about Plaintiff's Exhibit 3 which is in the Joint Appendix at 113 and 114.
1985.84-1273,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1666.985,1671.272,"May I ask whether you are reading the word ""qualified"" in your interpretation?"
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1671.272,1677.926,"--We don't have to define... I am reading the word ""qualified"" as the administrators themselves read it."
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1711.897,1715.301,"Mr. Conway, what is this Plaintiff's Exhibit 3?"
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1718.586,1722.472,"Well, it is not promulgated in the sense that a federal regulation is promulgated, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1722.472,1723.038,What is it?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1723.038,1725.657,It is this publication which I have before you.
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.583,1742.451,"Well, it simply is a publication."
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1745.82,1746.287,No.
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1753.141,1758.228,Did it come out before he applied for admission as a student at the University?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1758.228,1759.178,"No, it is some six years--"
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1759.178,1762.013,Was it part of the agreement he made with the University?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1762.013,1763.949,"--Yes, Your Honor, it is part of the agreement."
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1763.949,1767.484,How so if it hadn't been published when he was admitted as a student?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1767.484,1774.773,"Because, Your Honor, Mr. Ewing would have had the option not to take this exam if he knew there was one strike and you are out."
1985.84-1273,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1831.659,1835.277,Those examples are hardly comparable to this situation.
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1835.277,1837.979,"--Justice Blackmun, I suggest they are in this instance."
1985.84-1273,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1849.302,1851.654,Would you select him as your physician?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1851.654,1852.739,"I would, Your Honor."
1985.84-1273,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1863.544,1865.046,He is in an osteopathic school.
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1865.046,1875.486,"And, as Your Honor knows, there is... an osteopathic physician has all the rights of a M.D. graduate, to perform surgery in all the states, can perform in the same manner."
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.729,1918.598,What does your client want today by way of relief?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1918.598,1924.852,The relief he seeks is the right to take this examination at the University of Michigan which does two things.
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.852,1926.787,Does he want to go back to the University of Michigan?
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1926.787,1928.654,It gives him the opportunity to go back.
1985.84-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.964,1948.217,"Well, is he alleging that he wants to take the exam because he wants to gain admission, re-admission to the Medical School?"
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1948.217,1948.734,Yes.
1985.84-1273,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.904,1984.224,"Even if he goes back, you can't get rid of the fact that he did flunk more times than anybody else ever flunked."
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1984.224,1984.558,--Sure.
1985.84-1273,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1986.009,1988.111,"You can't get rid of that, can you?"
1985.84-1273,1,35640,michael_m_conway,,1988.111,1991.146,"--Justice Marshall, many people flunked."
