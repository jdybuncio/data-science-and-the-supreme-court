1967.73,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,30.796,"Number 73, In the Matter of John Ruffalo Jr., petitioner."
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,32.441,35.029,May it please this Honorable Court.
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,90.16,93.136,"Mr. Spangenberg, was this a disbarment in the Ohio Courts?"
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,93.872,95.657,"No, suspension, Mr. Justice."
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,95.657,98.853,"And there is suspension in Ohio, isn't there or not?"
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,98.853,105.514,"In words, no lawyer who has ever been suspended in Ohio has ever been reinstated as you may know."
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,121.07,121.871,After two years?
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,121.871,122.247,After two years.
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,122.247,124.109,This was a suspension --
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,124.109,124.493,Yes.
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,124.493,127.876,"-- in Ohio, but a disbarment from the Court of Appeals?"
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,127.876,128.005,That's right.
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,128.005,129.291,At the District Court also?
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,129.291,131.116,"That's right, sir."
1967.73,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,131.116,138.446,Did I understand that you say that never in the history of Ohio have they reinstated a man who was suspended for two years.
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,138.446,139.531,"That is true, Your Honor."
1967.73,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,139.531,142.924,Is that so?
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,142.924,150.726,"There is one pending now where there are some speculation he may be, and so it will be unique."
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,217.468,220.748,Does the Ohio Supreme Court appoint those 17 people?
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,220.748,224.084,"They appoint the Board of Commissioners, that's the 17."
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,224.084,224.867,The 17?
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,224.867,226.887,The panel comes from the Board.
1967.73,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.887,228.796,"From those 17, for what?"
1967.73,0,20122,craig_spangenberg,,230.061,233.026,I don't know the length of the term.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1560.477,1566.86,May it please the Court.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1676.285,1682.829,"Mr. Kokkka, what's the reference to undercover and secret -- what is the evidence in that?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1682.829,1688.485,"Yes, I walked to turn to that, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1701.113,1702.399,Because he was what?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1702.399,1708.549,"Because he was dishonest and that point, I want to develop later but first, I want to answer the question --"
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1708.549,1712.625,But what was the dishonesty this one that you're making a point here?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1712.625,1727.729,"Yes, the dishonesty was enlisting an employee in the very camp of the party he was suing to develop evidence against that party."
1967.73,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1745.585,1749.029,"Counsel, that's what the United States did in the Hoffa case."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1749.029,1755.325,"Your Honor, that -- the United States did not quite do that."
1967.73,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1778.669,1779.61,I wasn't talking about that.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1785.439,1803.558,"That is true, but may I say to that, that different policy considerations to begin with come into play there and that you are dealing with a criminal elements who do not regard and have no respect for the law."
1967.73,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1816.096,1827.694,"Well, if we have a constitutional question, I wouldn't think it would turn whether the man is a rascal, or a crook, a churchman, or a fine and outstanding citizen, because all the Constitution says, “Any person.”"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1827.694,1836.902,But the Court permitted the use in the Hoffa case of that evidence which was obtained by the undercover agent.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1836.902,1839.993,He was an employee of Hoffa.
1967.73,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1839.993,1846.389,"Well, he was -- I understood he was not an employee of Hoffa but the evidence was not used to convict Hoffa."
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1867.595,1879.165,You mean this -- the testimony of this employee of the Teamsters Union was not used in the Hoffa case?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1879.165,1883.881,Not in the -- not in the Test Fleet case.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1883.881,1886.55,You mean the criminal case against Hoffa?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1886.55,1888.051,"Yes, it was not used in that."
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1904.932,1906.618,Who were the defendants?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1906.618,1913.048,The defendants were Hoffa and the others but it was not in the Test Flee case that the evidence was used.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1913.048,1914.923,What about if it's used against Hoffa --
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1914.923,1915.446,Yes.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1915.446,1920.898,-- as this testimony was used against the B.& O.?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1920.898,1942.306,"This testimony was used against the B.& O., yes but there is a difference, we submit to Your Honors, in a situation that arises in a civil case and one that arises in a criminal case, I think different standards are applicable, and I say to your --"
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1942.306,1948.143,What difference in ethics is there between the criminal and the civil case?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1948.143,1958.628,The first is that you are dealing with a criminal problem with an element which does not respect the law.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1960.663,1965.709,"That there are a lot of people who were charged, who were not necessarily guilty?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1965.709,1974.907,"That is true but we are not saying to this man that he may not use an undercover agent, and the Sixth Circuit didn't say that."
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.045,1993.106,"Mr. Koykka, you've got now -- you've got two justices that would like for you to explain what do you mean by undercover, there are two of us who now --"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,1993.106,1997.998,"Yes, undercover -- let me put it this way."
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.265,2009.566,No (Voice Overlap) undercover agent -- and you said that Orlando --
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2009.566,2010.359,"Yes, Orlando was –-"
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2010.359,2013.666,-- was an undercover agent.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2014.502,2015.406,"Yes, it is."
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.097,2023.707,What is there in the record to show that he was an undercover agent?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2023.707,2031.217,It is the testimony of Mr. Ruffalo and Mr. Orlando.
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.619,2033.517,That it was a secret.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2034.582,2037.05,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.567,2046.146,I thought he actually transported witnesses to the court during that time.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2046.146,2050.827,That is one of the things that he did but it wasn't the thing on (Voice Overlap) was disbarred.
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.827,2053.702,"(Voice Overlap) do that, isn't it?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2053.702,2056.471,"No, I'm not referring to that."
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.201,2059.458,(Voice Overlap) that's the trouble he --
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2059.458,2060.928,I beg your pardon?
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.928,2061.585,I agree with you.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2066.609,2084.157,"Well, I'm trying to get to the basis for calling him an undercover agent that initially, when the charges were brought, there was no charge that he had hired Mr. Orlando to investigate cases."
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2114.194,2114.808,Excuse me.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2119.26,2128.928,"Those charges were, but there were other charges of solicitation that were sustained by the commissioners but not sustained in the state court."
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2128.928,2148.052,"All right but however that may be, as the matter now stands, there is no finding that any -- before us, that Orlando or anybody else are not authorized to do so, not properly authorized to do so solicited business for Ruffalo, is that right?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2148.052,2149.42,That is right.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2168.646,2172.963,"All right, now why is that undercover (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2172.963,2175.532,"I am trying to, but I have to give Your Honors, the background."
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2175.532,2176.358,Yes.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2185.71,2186.22,That's right.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2187.489,2188.905,"Well, is that all there is to the case?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2188.905,2190.058,"No, it isn't."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2208.423,2211.55,Is he disbarred -- is he disbarred for that?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2211.55,2217.502,He is disbarred for that very thing for hiring secretly --
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2217.502,2219.495,Disbarred for destroying his checks?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2219.495,2221.153,"No, no, Your Honor."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2221.153,2222.558,But what does that have to do with it?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2222.558,2230.901,"It has this to do with it, that he then was asked why and he said, “And this is what makes him an undercover agent.”"
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.386,2261.936,It could be simply that he didn't --
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2261.936,2263.852,And that was the evidence of dishonesty?
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.852,2268.197,Mr. Orlando didn't want to get fired?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2269.423,2270.948,It could have been but that --
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.948,2272.299,Was that illegal?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2272.299,2273.333,It is -- it does not --
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.333,2274.314,Was that illegal?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2274.314,2281.463,It does not lessen the lawyer's obligation not to get a layman into that kind of position.
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2281.463,2283.684,"Well, what kind of a position is it?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2293.696,2295.42,"No, I did not say that, Your Honor."
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.379,2298.735,"Well, I --"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2298.735,2298.796,I--
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.796,2300.406,-- assume that you agree with it.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2300.406,2301.927,"No, I do not agree with it."
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.637,2314.49,"You mean that if an employee of a railroad comes into a lawyer's office and says, “I'm willing to give you information."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2324.605,2328.866,It would not be wrong but that is not what was done here.
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2333.869,2335.158,How long?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2335.158,2336.191,How long?
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2347.441,2353.161,How long had the association of the railroad had been investigating Orlando?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2353.161,2355.975,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.762,2392.981,"My question is, that if the association of railroads had been investigating Orlando and Ruffalo, let's say five or more years, well at least during that period, Orlando wouldn't have been a “secret” agent?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2392.981,2413.384,"They were investigating on the business of soliciting and not -- it never apparently occurred to them that he was actually investigating cases against the railroad because that fact never appeared until Mr. Ruffalo said, “That is my defense to the charge of solicitation.”"
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.384,2415.325,And then you amended the charges?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2415.325,2430.321,Then the charge was amended and the panel made perfectly clear that he could have whatever time he needed to answer that charge and indeed the hearings did not close until eight months later.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2444.263,2453.439,"Was he also an -- in your submission, was Orlando an undercover agent as against all the other railroads for whom he investigated?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2453.439,2457.93,"That I don't know, and the record does not show.But it does show that --"
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2457.93,2460.525,"Well, doesn't it show that he did the same kind of work?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2463.459,2464.106,That he --
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2464.106,2465.066,-- he investigated all the railroads.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2465.066,2466.431,Investigated all the railroad cases.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2466.431,2469.407,"Against all railroads, yes."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2471.81,2472.618,I don't know.
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2478.94,2489.355,You don't mean to suggest that a lawyer would have to disclose to the other railroads that he had an outside investigator and give him the name?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2489.355,2489.593,Oh!
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2492.89,2493.981,"Wait, just a minute."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2505.591,2508.178,Subject to one possible condition.
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2527.315,2528.818,That is quite a doctrine.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2530.756,2531.557,No.
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2532.804,2534.184,Let me ask you another question.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2534.184,2535.102,Yes.
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2535.102,2545.164,"How many -- in how many instances according to the record did Orlando investigate claims against the B.& O., his employer?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2545.164,2557.445,The record does not show the number he investigated but it was admitted by Mr. Ruffalo frankly that he did investigate Baltimore & Ohio claims.
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2557.445,2560.798,The records didn't show there was one or a hundred.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2560.798,2564.43,"Well, there are at least three that are mentioned in the record."
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2564.43,2565.893,Against the B.& O.?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2565.893,2567.771,"Against the B.& O., yes, Your Honor."
1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2567.771,2578.674,And did those relate to the area of Mr. Orlando's own employment for the B.& O.'s?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2581.317,2582.349,The record does not show.
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.506,2730.471,So you are going to draw a line then between the continuous course of dealing with an employee because I don't suppose you would deny that a lawyer in investigating his client's case may call on fellow employees and a fellow employee may give him as much information as he has about the accident.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2730.471,2731.993,"Of course, he may."
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.694,2748.028,"And let's assume –- let's assume that that lawyer constantly goes to a particular foreman, a yard foreman where almost these accidents occur, the yard foreman readily and voluntarily gives in all the information he had."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2749.864,2760.292,"Well, you -- if that is what he is doing, I think the lawyer has a right to do that but that is not this case."
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.292,2761.847,What's the line you draw?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2761.847,2769.099,The line is hiring an employee as a regular course of conduct.
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.502,2799.461,"Should we say the yard foreman -- if the yard foreman says to him, “Sorry, I don't know anything about that,” and the lawyer said, “Well, could you please find out about it for me and tell me whom I may talk to.”"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2810.576,2817.505,"Well, if it were in the one case, I think that no lawyer would be disbarred for that."
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2825.705,2831.588,"How many times does he have to do it, the course of conduct?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2831.588,2839.308,"He has -- well, when he does it over a period from '57 to '61."
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2839.308,2841.829,"Well, how many cases against the B.& O. does this record show Orlando helped investigate?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2841.829,2844.559,There are at least three that are mentioned.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2844.559,2845.844,In seven years?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2845.844,2852.477,"Well, there was no inquiry as to how many cases there were."
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2854.133,2855.379,Why didn't you ask him?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2855.379,2859.488,"I -- well, I didn't ask him because I wasn't there but he was --"
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2859.488,2862.047,Why didn't -- why didn't those who were prosecuting asked him?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2862.047,2874.512,"I would say obviously, they did not inquire into that because in their view to hire a man to do that kind of thing, not go to him casually to say, “Tell me about this accident.”"
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.336,2910.65,"Well, I take it that you disagree with the other side of saying that the Railroad Adjustment Board views this practice as not a sufficient reason for firing."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2910.65,2917.428,The Railroad Adjustment Board does not so view this practice in the very case that they cite.
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.822,2943.297,"That's different too, isn't it?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2943.297,2945.402,"Well, he took a picture --"
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.402,2947.481,That's different from just getting information from it --
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2947.481,2948.465,Well its --
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.465,2951.301,"-- and investigation, isn't it?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2951.301,2959.358,"The only difference is that there -- was in the form of the information that was brought back rather than by word of mouth, there it was brought back by --"
1967.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.358,2966.819,Do you have any Railroad Adjustment Board cases that sustain firings on facts like these?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,2966.819,2976.528,"No, but what the Board said in that very case, it said only that he has a right to tell what he knows about an accident, period."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3059.638,3060.697,May I ask you one or two questions?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3060.697,3062.374,Yes.
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3062.374,3067.919,Is there any law passed by the legislature of the State of Ohio against it?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3067.919,3068.964,None that I know of.
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3068.964,3072.005,Has there ever been any attempt to get one?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3072.005,3073.689,Not that I know of.
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3073.689,3080.495,Has the Supreme Court of your state ever held before that a man could be disbarred on this showing?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3080.495,3086.064,"So far as I -- so far as I know, there has been no like case."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3086.064,3087.858,"Well, I'm not asking if there's been any like it."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3090.727,3091.114,"Well, not that I know of."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3091.114,3094.247,Have they ever disbarred a man on a showing like this.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3094.247,3095.761,Not that I know of.
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3095.761,3100.217,Do you -- have you investigated other states?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3100.217,3100.987,Yes.
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3100.987,3105.854,How many states have a law that makes this a cause for disbarment?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3105.854,3136.199,"Well, I don't know of any state that has a law to that effect but I can give you a case that isn't cited in the briefs but decided in Rhode Island where the lawyer employed, first an investigator in a divorce case to investigate the -- on behalf of the wife, and then after that service had terminated, the lawyer on the other side, after a appreciable distance of time --"
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3136.199,3138.597,"Well you don't think that's like this case, do you?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3138.597,3139.985,Well --
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3139.985,3147.735,"As a matter of fact, what you have is, you keep saying he violated something and he did something wrong."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3162.592,3164.991,"No, I would not accept that, Mr. Justice Black."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3164.991,3165.353,Oh!
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3166.968,3171.645,I say that this lawyer violated the first duty that the lawyer --
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3171.645,3173.69,That's because you think it's wrong.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3173.69,3174.05,Because I --
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3174.05,3176.576,That's because you think it's wrong.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3176.576,3177.642,And I --
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3177.642,3180.829,What law book do you have that says it's wrong?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3180.829,3195.366,"The first Statute of Westminster enacted in 1275 that says, “That any sergeant or lawyer who engages in deception against not only the court but against the party."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3195.366,3206.583,You're citing the Statute of Westminster in order to justify disbarring a man in 1968 in Ohio which has no law against what he did.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3206.583,3215.611,"If, Your Honor, please, that Statute of Westminster has come down to us into our present Code of Ethics, the Canons."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3227.769,3244.443,Do you think any man ought to be disbarred or any man ought to be prosecuted and convicted of a crime where there has been no clear legal statement made in advance that that is the law?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3244.443,3248.191,"In my view, there is a clear statement in --"
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3248.191,3248.242,Where?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3248.242,3249.186,-- in the Canons.
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3250.814,3252.741,"That's what you're relying on, Canon 41?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3252.741,3266.917,"Canon 41 plus the oath that I heard lawyers take this morning that he will conduct himself, demean himself uprightly and according to law."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3267.575,3269.707,"According to the law, that's right."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3272.917,3274.037,The only --
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3274.037,3278.273,"So you don't claim that anybody could have known this was against the law in Ohio, do you?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3278.273,3279.515,"I do, Your Honor."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3280.555,3282.909,That's because you think it's wrong?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3282.909,3298.647,"I think it is wrong because of what I read, for example, in the rule of this Court, “The only standard this Court lays down for disbarment is conduct unbecoming a member of the profession.”"
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3337.128,3345.642,Do you think the home owner could have his home taken away from him by statement that he had done something which the law did not forbid?
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3345.642,3347.007,"No, I do not."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3347.57,3351.189,Do you think he would be entitled to due process to protect his property?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3351.189,3351.493,I think --
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3351.493,3355.375,What about his lifeblood in the law practice?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3355.375,3377.933,"I think this lawyer was accorded due process and I say that if he had read the literature on discipline, he would have found that there are many cases the country over where lawyers have been disciplined even though there was no Canon that in so many words said that conduct."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3377.933,3382.365,"In other words, he had been disciplined whether he had not known that it was against the law?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3382.365,3389.159,"Well, because a lawyer is expected to adhere to high standards, the standards so high."
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3389.159,3393.067,"Standard is a big, big question."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3397.027,3397.105,"Well, they --"
1967.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3397.105,3407.48,"I must confess that I cannot see anything wrong, whatever, in a lawyer hiring somebody to do get some evidence for him, whenever he would."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3407.48,3416.921,"Against his own employer and that, Your Honors, we say is conduct unworthy of a lawyer."
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3418.223,3441.915,"Mr. Koykka, you made this an important issue in your case, the fact that this lawyer had failed to use a customary practice in paying this employee that he paid the others by check and he paid this one in cash so that other people would know it."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3463.587,3466.697,"Well, I don't like you getting to the division on the court on that subjective question --"
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3466.697,3469.429,"No, you don't have to get the division just to answer my question."
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3469.429,3472.422,But I think there is.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3490.694,3500.842,Wasn't Partin an employee of the Teamsters Union of which Mr. Hoffa was the president?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3500.842,3509.475,He was an officer of the Teamsters Union but I don't believe that he was an employee of Mr. Hoffa was the president?
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3509.475,3521.322,Do you think that if he had been that the government would have been guilty of the same kind of misconduct and immorality that occurred in this case?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3521.322,3528.296,I think that wrong is in suborning the employee of the party you are suing.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3536.52,3540.478,It suborn in the sense of having him falsify something?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3540.478,3540.501,No.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3540.501,3541.861,Why are you using suborn?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3541.861,3547.376,Suborn to corrupt him from his duty to his employer.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3547.808,3558.066,That is -- all as I understood that that's involved here is that Orlando investigated the facts regarding cases against B.& O.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3558.066,3559.366,Against his --
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3559.366,3559.736,All right!
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3562.699,3563.097,No.
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3563.097,3565.843,Well then I don't know that suborn is right.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3565.843,3570.55,"He was suborned from his duty to his employer, the B.& O."
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3593.188,3604.191,"What is the duty, the level of duty of loyalty of a man that checks airbrakes on cars in B.& O. Railroad?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3604.191,3605.002,It is the same --
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3605.002,3613.016,"Wouldn't be his loyalty be to a good workman like job on an airbrake, period?"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3613.016,3621.736,"It is the same kind of duty as we impose upon a trustee, for example, where we --"
1967.73,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3621.736,3623.053,That's your position.
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3623.683,3634.931,We say that we will not permit you to get into that situation where you may breach your duty of loyalty.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3642.707,3676.868,"What do you do at this language of the National Railroad Adjustment Board where it says, “On the other hand, there is no doubt whatever of the right of an employee when off duty to assist an injured employee or his representative in any manner including the gathering of evidence and so long as it is limited to the development of truth, it cannot be regarded as disloyalty nor afford just grounds for discharge.”"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3676.868,3681.315,I have no complaint with that statement.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3693.501,3709.065,Where do you get any authority for saying there is a difference between doing this specifically on one hand and paying him for his time when he's off duty on the other?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3709.065,3712.794,"I think there is all that difference in the world, Your Honor."
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3732.733,3746.325,"Well, this language says, “He has a right to assist an injured employee or his representative in any manner including the gathering of evidence.”"
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3752.788,3756.964,I don't think the matter of payment is particularly relevant.
1967.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3756.964,3757.995,But what is relevant?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3757.995,3773.936,"But the fact that he enters upon a course of conduct and that a lawyer suborns that obligation of loyalty and says, “You, you go and investigate things against your own employer.”"

1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3797.211,3801.29,Is this statement under your adversaries' brief accurate?

1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3828.156,3828.577,And is it true?
1967.73,1,42925,thomas_v_koykka,,3828.577,3836.763,I cannot answer it from the record.I am told that the president have actually nothing to do with the --
1967.73,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3836.763,3840.17,Was he the original counsel of the B.& O. Railroad at that time?

1967.73,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3852.899,3853.12,Could I ask you one question?
