1968.45,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.916,"Number 45, United States Petitioner versus Richard G. Augenblick et al."
1968.45,0,23379,edwin_l_weisl,,66.805,70.316,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2553.753,2556.996,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1968.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.359,2630.13,Go to the Court of Military Appeal.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2630.13,2632.677,"He can go to the Court of Military Appeal, that's correct."
1968.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.711,2651.504,"But if they had taken it and affirmed it, wouldn't it come to them?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2651.504,2655.836,"No, no there is no jurisdiction between the Court of Military Appeals and this court."
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2655.836,2662.021,What is the difference between that and our certiorari?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2662.021,2665.684,There is no certiorari jurisdiction to the Court of Military Appeals from this Court.
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2665.684,2666.805,"Well, no, no."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2679.0,2686.273,Well contrary to what Mr. Weisl said and so far as I read the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2704.066,2705.185,Their discretion.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2705.185,2710.879,Their discretion here and they did not need to -- they deemed not to exercise their discretion.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.013,2727.32,What constitutional right are you asserting?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2727.32,2728.423,In this case?
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.423,2729.346,Yes sir.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2729.346,2737.79,Mr. Justice Marshall we're talking in this case about the constitutional right to preparing adequate defense against impropriety that it spreads throughout this record.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.23,2745.841,"Well let's put, what constitutional section are you relying on?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2745.841,2747.476,The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2747.476,2749.964,What is the denial of due process here?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2749.964,2763.787,The denial of due process here is the depravation of the right of the defense through statutory rights that he's been granted to prepare a defense against impropriety that is right from this record.
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2816.276,2825.384,"ell, but your client is only right to go the Court of Appeals is one conferred by the Congress is that right?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2825.384,2826.4,Court of Military Appeals?
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2826.4,2827.923,"Court of Claims, Court of Claims."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2827.923,2829.15,That's correct sir.
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2829.15,2853.941,And possibly Congress could circumscribe that right in various ways and I should think that the first task would be to ascertain whether Congress intended to circumscribe the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in the way that Mr. Weisl has argued.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2853.941,2854.366,I think if could --
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2854.366,2869.63,"Then if you find, and if you conclude that Congress did intend so to circumscribe the jurisdictional Court of Claims maybe we come next to your -- to what you're making as a constitutional point."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2869.63,2870.366,I think that's correct sir.
1968.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2878.714,2892.354,"Well on the use of that witness that you just mentioned, don't that facts that you've related go to the credibility of the witness rather than to the -- rather than to his right to testify?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2892.354,2903.361,"No sir, he was used -- it doesn't go to credibility, what it does do is that it goes to the question of impropriety on the part of the prosecution and arranging for the testimony of this key witness."
1968.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2938.03,2940.187,Well wouldn't that still go to his credibility?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2940.187,2944.484,"No, I think it goes, Mr. Chief Justice to a point beyond credibility."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2981.079,2987.216,Well was it denied or was there a dispute as to whether it was then in existence?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2987.216,2992.954,It was never denied that it was in existence at the time it was made Mr. Justice Marshall.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.954,2995.918,"Oh no, I'm talking about the time it was asked for."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,2995.918,2997.12,You're quite correct it was --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2997.12,3000.976,Was there dispute as to whether it was in existence?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3000.976,3002.353,That quite correct there was dispute--
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3002.353,3004.683,Is that a question of fact?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3004.683,3005.805,That question of fact was --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3005.805,3007.377,Is it a question of fact?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3007.377,3008.507,That is a question of fact clearly.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.507,3010.603,Is that a constitutional question?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3010.603,3011.936,It is in this case for the following reason.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.936,3013.655,Or facts in that constitutional.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3013.655,3030.245,"No, certainly not, the facts can very often and most often not be, but in this case the resolution of this problem by the navy was to put the burden of proof of bad faith on the government in losing this tape or in destroying it on the defendant."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.519,3038.023,And what constitution of section does that deal with?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3038.023,3041.762,By itself sir it doesn't deal with any constitutional section at all that's a violation.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3041.762,3044.419,As a matter fact it's all the question of fact isn't it?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3044.419,3054.035,"No sir these are questions of law, every one of them, these are questions of law and the administration of the Jencks Act under the circumstances of this case."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3087.409,3098.505,"I have gotten to there, I was left with the point that I don't know as of right now whether those tapes were in existence at the time you are talking about I don't know."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3098.505,3099.326,That's quite true sir.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3099.326,3100.704,And you don't know.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3100.704,3101.523,That's quite true sir.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3101.523,3103.344,And nobody knows.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3103.344,3113.314,"And it's quite true, but that Navy's the exoneration of the government's obligation to produce these tapes, which were obviously, which were in the navy's hands, which were hand --"
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.314,3117.083,"At that time, they were in the navy's hand at that time?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3117.083,3125.667,"Well, the navy was -- the individual who took the tape was last one who the record shows have the tapes and he was one in whose hands the tape disappeared."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.667,3133.185,"But didn't they, wasn't there evident testimony to the fact that it could have very have been destroyed, they couldn't find it."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3133.185,3133.637,And the one is --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3133.637,3136.46,It could have been expunged.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3136.46,3138.451,There is certainly evidence to that effect sir.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3138.451,3139.315,There is isn't it.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3139.315,3147.59,"There is certainly evidence to that effect, but there is also evidence that this was in violation of the navy's owns policies and regulations with regard to Jencks materials."
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3270.317,3283.15,"Well, is that true the second sentence was 76 2, that binding upon all the departments of court's agencies."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3283.15,3285.268,"Yes sir, that is because I think."
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3285.268,3292.829,"Well, I mean does that have that limitation that you suggest, certainly it doesn't on the face of it, does it?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3292.829,3316.224,"Well, we -- the point of that is as far as I can see there were some, there are very many muddy things about this, but there is about the legislative history in this, the point of that as far as I can see is the elimination of command control in the first place to indicate where the cutting off point of military procedures are as it was --"
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3316.224,3327.764,"Yes, Mr. Sharlitt on its face the language is all action taken to disown to those proceedings or binding upon all departments, courts."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3327.764,3329.151,"Courts, yes --"
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3329.151,3329.737,What the courts had to do with the man?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3329.737,3330.954,I believe the meaning of that --
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3330.954,3334.009,What do they have to do with the chain of command control?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3334.009,3352.623,"Well, I believe that what they had to do with that in a situation such as this where you had the -- where you had a court-martial determination that the civilian, the Federal civilian courts, which is all that could be ruled upon here could not under those circumstances try to service him for the same crime."
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3407.234,3414.087,You don't agree that the Court of Claims could not properly reevaluate the evidence?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3414.087,3421.123,"Oh, I think that's clear the Court of Claims is not an ordinary appellate review of military court-martial under no circumstances."
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3421.123,3433.201,"Then unless, unless the Court of Claim, unless it's a constitutional claim the Court of Claims could not arrive in a different judgment?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3433.201,3486.37,"I would very hardly agree with that sir, that unless you have rules of law that come to this court as rules of law and don't involve any resifting of the evidence, which this court very specifically proscribed in Burns versus Wilson then you don't have any jurisdiction in the Court of Claims, but you do have jurisdiction in the Court of Claims where you have rules of law such as you have in this case, such as you, the putting of the burden for showing bad faith in the destruction of the Jencks materials or the negligent loss of that material on the defendant, such as the failure to conduct an in camera examination of the notes taken during this key interview, such as the failure to call the key witness to testify as to what happened, the witness who denied of taking this tapes and the witness in whose hands this tape disappeared, failure to call him, these are rules of law."
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3494.63,3501.839,But it's not every mistake as to law that is a constitutional error is it?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3501.839,3502.603,I beg your pardon sir.
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3502.603,3509.203,It is not every mistake as to rule of law committed in the trial of a case that amounts to constitutional --
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3509.203,3512.352,"Oh, absolutely not, no we are not our position is not."
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3512.352,3520.532,What you are saying here is there were so many mistakes made that in the aggregate they amount to constitutional error is that your point?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3520.532,3562.208,"What we are saying here sir is that exactly right, that the Jencks deprivation is that, the right as this court annunciated in all the cases in Johnson versus Zerbst court filed through the most recent one through the Giles case and all the case right down the line, that a defendant is entitled to a trial free from impropriety is meaningless tool unless the rights guaranteed him by statute exist to him to enquire into that impropriety and the right to enquire into that impropriety where the impropriety is on the record as it is in this case, is coextensive and vindictive with his right to a trail free from that, that impropriety."
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3620.171,3632.168,"Listening to your argument, you do not take the position that Congress could not have barred the Court of Claims from making this enquiry do you?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3632.168,3633.196,The Congress could not have --
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3633.196,3637.565,Could not Congress constitutionally have barred the Court of Claims for making this enquiry.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3637.565,3645.21,"Mr. Justice Brennan that raises one of the great, great questions of constitutional law that I think is presently unresolved."
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3650.07,3666.189,"Now that wasn't my question, my question was whether the Congress could have said that the Court of Claims might not, could not had no jurisdiction if you please whatever language you want to use, barred the Court of Claims from making any inquiry into this court-martial that it did make."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3666.189,3674.376,"I think that Congress that there is some large question of constitutionality as to whether Congress can do that, and I said so --"
1968.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3674.376,3677.309,"Congress could abolish the Court of Claims couldn't it, it created them."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3677.309,3686.11,"Oh, yes, they readily do that, the question is whether Congress could take servicemen who have acknowledged constitutional rights, this court has articulated in Burns versus Wilson."
1968.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3686.11,3688.769,In fact we are talking about a particular tribunal --
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3688.769,3689.217,Yes sir.
1968.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3700.429,3717.072,"Well let me ask you this, then you are saying if, if we were to constitute a 76 as barring the Court of Claims from making this inquiry then your position is that article 76 is unconstitutional."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3717.072,3719.522,"We say this in our brief, we stand by it sir."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3732.771,3735.425,Burns didn't involve Sara.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3735.425,3762.836,"No sir, Burns is habeas corpus, but Burns articulated constitutional rights Mr. Justice Marshall and my point is that if there are constitutional rights, then they are meaningless unless there is a court to protect them and in Article I court such as court of military appeals which had none of the attributes of an Article III court which has, well I think the selling substance is that the Supreme Court is and should remain the final arbiter -- of the constitutional rights of servicemen."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3762.836,3765.33,You wanted to claim Article 76 unconstitutional?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3765.33,3775.861,"No sir, I do not I want you to -- I want this court simply to view the legislative history as I believe its properly viewed and that is not in anyway --"
1968.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3775.861,3777.736,Well let me see how far that goes Mr. Sharlitt.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3793.088,3793.958,No sir.
1968.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3794.337,3802.442,Then I don't follow your argument that this court should be the tribunal of last resort on the constitutional claims of Servicemen.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3802.442,3808.518,Because the only way under the circumstances that Commander Augenblick could get in this court is sue the Court of Claims.
1968.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3808.518,3810.845,"No, no that's wasn't my question to you."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3836.158,3839.187,"No sir cannot, they cannot not by direct --"
1968.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3839.187,3844.602,Then there are exceptions for your general proposition that this court should remain the court of last resort for the --
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3844.602,3857.564,"No sir, they are not, because I am saying that in order to accept a government position you have to, you have to state that the place that the commander did go to him, the Court of Claims has denied him."
1968.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3865.841,3873.387,"But he did, he had an opportunity for review and it was denied to him in the Court of Military Appeals wouldn't it, on these, on these very same claims?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3873.387,3879.192,"My point was that the, our (Inaudible) of constitutionality of serviceman should be the Supreme Court --"
1968.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3879.192,3882.974,"Why is that, where do you find that on the constitution?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3882.974,3884.359,"I don't sir, I don't find it --"
1968.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3884.359,3885.627,Or anywhere else?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3885.627,3889.953,I don't find it in the constitution but I do believe that --
1968.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3889.953,3902.628,What if the Congress said that in no events will Supreme Court review any instances of court-martial judgments?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3902.628,3910.335,If they had said that the question would have been posed squarely and it hasn't said that and I think until it does this court --
1968.45,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3910.335,3921.272,I mean you can't find any grant by the Congress of any jurisdiction for this court to review courts-martial.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3921.272,3934.912,"No sir, but I can give you a long line of cases where this court is strained in every circumstance to find judicial review in a situation where Congress has purported to grant finality to an administrative agency."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3951.384,3973.287,"Well Sharlitt, suppose a serviceman was found guilty of some minor charge and given six months without salary and he is still in army, its your position that he could go to the Court of Appeals and say I didn't get my Jencks Act materials, so I want my salary."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3973.287,3975.344,He is out in prison sir?
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3975.344,3978.742,"No he is out, he served his six months in stock clearing --"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3978.742,3980.882,Oh and those --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3980.882,3983.508,But he is still in army.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,3987.374,3992.186,"No, I don't, if he had been denied back pay I believe that if he falls within the jurisdictional limits."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3994.768,4001.399,"No, no my point is, he just alleges that he was denied Jencks act material."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4001.399,4002.841,"No sir, no because --"
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4002.841,4004.287,What else would he have to do?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4004.287,4014.036,He would have to show exactly what Judge Davis and unanimous court found below that the record supported a finding of unconstitutionality --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4014.036,4016.74,"Alright, then he sends the record which shows that."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4016.74,4017.775,Then I think you have a case exactly --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4017.775,4023.674,And is he is still over in the Germany but the Court of Claims has given his back pay.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4023.674,4028.769,I believe under those circumstances that the Court of Claims jurisdiction for back pay still exists and that case it would be --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4028.769,4033.054,Well what happens to the army discipline in the mean time?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4033.054,4034.391,Well army discipline sir is --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4034.391,4040.57,What happens to army discipline in that regiment in the mean time?
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4040.57,4041.422,Well army discipline sir is --
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4041.422,4046.673,When the Court of Claim moves in and upsets the army discipline.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4046.673,4052.808,"Well army discipline is always involved in these matters, when army, army prosecutions are conducted irregularly."
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4052.808,4060.579,Well I don't think army discipline as of now is involved with your commander because he is out and this man is still in.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4060.579,4065.225,I don't think constitutionality of court-martials turns on whether a man is out or in sir.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4065.225,4066.643,Discipline does.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4066.643,4070.6,Well discipline and unconstitutionality are two different things and this court has said so.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4070.6,4077.246,"So that on the out, there are no judgment of a court-martial would be final until passed on by the Court of Claims."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4077.246,4078.554,Absolutely not sir.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4078.554,4079.606,Close.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4079.606,4091.788,"No sir, not even close, miles apart, miles apart because I might point out that twice in 17 years the Court of Claims has exercised its jurisdiction and in the Augenblick case --"
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4091.788,4094.941,"For this case, well I am looking for the future."
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4094.941,4102.582,Well I might point out that there has been no flood in the Court of Claims and there won't be sir.
1968.45,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4102.582,4109.279,It be that they read Article 76 to say that no court has jurisdiction.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4118.497,4150.788,"Well now, I think the number there would at least eight times, at least seven times, Mr. Justice Marshall where these cases were taken to the Court of Claims, where the Court of Claims went through the exercise that the government now says was forbidden to of looking at the merits assume jurisdiction looked at the merits and denied the relief on grounds that there wasn't any constitutional exercise so that if there were any clubhouse for barracks and lawyers they have always existed and it hasn't been the language of the Article 76, that's inhibited this review, it's been the restraint of the Court of Claims."
1968.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4184.361,4189.765,"That's not the law, the case law of the Court of Military Appeals is it?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4197.215,4198.907,"That's correct sir, that's correct."
1968.45,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4200.336,4203.482,MThey can be counted on to do so based on their past record.
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4203.482,4252.54,"No but as Mr. Weisl pointed out that there is an additional quantum of, well of rejection that's involved in the C.M.A's turning down a case simply much more than this court simply turning down a case and I would point out that in the Board of Review, the Board of Review's opinion which deals with this case that the law, the law now is as the law from the military since this went to the Court of Military Appeals and there was no review of this determination on Jencks, is that the burden, the clear burden and they couldn't be clear, it's in the record here."
1968.45,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4325.071,4347.317,"Mr. Sharlitt suppose the Court of Military Appeals that, taken this case instead of having refused to review it and had heard all of your arguments along this line and had to affirm the conviction of this man would you then, would the Court of Claims then be available to you?"
1968.45,1,33106,joseph_h_sharlitt,,4347.317,4348.218,"Yes sir, it would."
1968.45,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4421.346,4422.766,Mr. Steiner?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4422.766,4426.327,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4465.787,4471.092,"Was it put to him in just that language that you've said, where in the record --?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4471.092,4480.352,"Your Honor, Appendix III, pages 362 and 363 is an affidavit of an air policeman who had custody."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4480.352,4482.358,"Well, he wasn't a witness."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4482.358,4487.443,"No, this is an affidavit in the board of correction proceedings Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4501.519,4505.265,And this is the part of the record of the trial?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4505.265,4516.334,"Not of the court-martial Your Honor, it was an affidavit submitted to the Correction Board, but it's part of this trial and part of this record Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4539.137,4567.914,"Let me revert just a moment, I've, I want to know if you're telling us precisely what you said and I'm looking at this affidavit and it says subsequent to airman Hughes' trial and prior to Sergeant Juhl's court-martial, this airman was advised that unless he agreed to appear as a prosecution witness and testify, he would be tried by a general court-martial and so forth."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4567.914,4568.589,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4568.589,4578.041,You just told us that unless he testified and implicated this man now he didn't say that according to this affidavit.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4578.041,4581.376,"Well, Your Honor that he testified against Juhl that's what I meant--"
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4581.376,4583.583,"Well, it says that he --"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4583.583,4584.533,As a prosecution witness Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4584.533,4586.391,Testified for the prosecution.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4586.391,4588.79,"For the prosecution, as a prosecution witness."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4588.79,4593.016,But does that imply that he used to tell anything but the truth.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4593.016,4601.734,"Not that alone Your Honor but when combined with all of these facts of this case, his testimony was replete within inconsistencies, with self contradiction."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4601.734,4609.214,"No, I'm not quarreling with that, I just want, I just -- calling your attention to what you said and what the affidavit says."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4609.214,4618.111,"Yes, Your Honor I think that -- well I interpreted that as a prosecution witness and it maybe a little more of an interpretation of it."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4618.111,4621.053,"That's all, that's all I don't want to interrupt your argument otherwise go ahead --."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4621.053,4632.211,"Yes Your Honor but combined with all of these facts and the inconsistencies and self contradictions under oath in his testimony, it was totally unreliable."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4657.202,4664.829,Is there anything to show that he did partner himself in this hearing?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4664.829,4696.151,"Well, Your Honor the closest to it -- one is he denied all these things but in this hearing, you could say this time he's telling the truth, but in the Article 32 proceedings, which is also part of these records, the discovery records, they're asking, would you lie under oath, would you lie under oath, and like he said yes that's part of the record to that -- now whether he's telling the truth this time or not, but the inconsistencies and improbabilities in his testimonies make it look that all the pages are fraud."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4696.294,4698.676,That shows the credibility doesn't it?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4698.676,4701.257,"Yes, Your Honor it does but when you get so many of them I think it comes --"
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4701.257,4707.024,"And credibility is a little below a constitutional question, isn't it?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4707.024,4713.377,"Yes, Your Honor just on credibility but you also get a statistical impossibility when there are so many of these inconsistencies."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4717.736,4720.623,It's still one witness's credibility.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4720.623,4726.003,"Well, it's still the fact that he's also testified on these very same facts under oath --"
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4726.003,4731.65,Well normally in an ordinary criminal trial you know the credibility left to the triar of facts usually.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4731.65,4759.533,"But Your Honor we have a provision here which covers under the manual itself, I think that alone is enough regardless of Section 76 but if it's not, the manual for court-martials provide in Section 153 (a) and this is an instruction to the court-martial panel, you cannot face a conviction upon the un-corroborated testimony of an accomplice, if that testimony is self-contradictory, uncertain or improbable."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4759.533,4762.742,And who is to be the Judge of that?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4762.854,4770.592,"I think, not that court necessarily Your Honor, if the record shows that no other conclusion can be reached, if you have a jury trial."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4770.592,4774.614,Do you have anything in your case other than the credibility of the witnesses?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4774.614,4784.637,"Yes, Your Honor I've got the assurance of the -- it's not just the credibility of the witnesses, it's the question of all these facts showing that no other conclusion can be reached then --"
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4784.637,4786.794,Is this man still in the army?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4786.794,4787.912,"Yes, Your Honor, he is."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4787.912,4788.715,He is still serving?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4788.715,4789.746,In the air force.
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4789.746,4790.964,He is in air force.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4790.964,4791.648,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4791.648,4796.257,And you want us to approve paying him his back pay.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4796.257,4796.949,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4796.949,4798.673,While he's still in the air force?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4798.673,4800.531,Yes Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4800.531,4802.998,And you don't see a disciplinary problem either do you?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4802.998,4806.762,"No, your -- not -- when it conflicts with the constitutional right of a fair trial."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4820.694,4823.27,Well that's just like an instruction isn't?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4823.27,4826.517,"No, no I don't believe it is Your Honor, not at all."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4843.65,4863.788,"(Inaudible) is a daily matter for the enforcement of the narcotic laws that the government uses narcotic addiction notoriously irresponsible and untruthful, will have a string of convictions, maybe a block long."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4869.378,4870.236,"Well yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4871.235,4875.392,Does that deprive the Court of Jurisdiction?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4875.392,4888.903,"Your Honor, if the facts were the same as this I would say yes, I would say with all of the self contradictions and the improbabilities in his testimony, if that was the only evidence, it wouldn't be sufficient to convict."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4908.833,4912.223,Is there any other evidence besides him in this case?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4912.223,4916.996,"None that would tie him -- this is not corroborated, there is other testimony."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4916.996,4918.766,Nothing that would corroborate him?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4918.766,4921.198,"Nothing that would corroborate him, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4964.088,4971.865,But didn't she also testify that they would punch it twice in the same hole on his ration card?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4971.865,4972.758,"No, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4975.302,4976.733,Somebody did in the record.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4976.733,4977.761,"Oh, yes Your Honor they are."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4977.761,4981.321,And that would look like it was getting more than the usual amount.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4981.321,4982.317,"No, Your Honor this -- she said that --"
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4982.317,4985.128,It would usually save hole for two cottons.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,4985.128,4989.772,"She did -- she said she did this for some people, but again this is another."
1968.45,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5138.613,5141.432,"Well, this is not a Habeas Corpus case is it?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5141.432,5143.803,"Well, Your Honor the same rules would apply."
1968.45,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5143.803,5148.934,"No, this is not Habeas Corpus case."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5148.934,5152.573,"We are not seeking the relief, but I believe the same principle applies."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5171.687,5176.678,My great difficulty is that none of that is in the purview of the Court of Claims.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5180.961,5184.72,"He has the right to his back pay, under the Court of Claims Jurisdiction."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5184.72,5185.566,Period.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5185.566,5186.75,Under the constitution.
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5186.75,5190.125,But can the Court of Claims issue writ of Habeas Corpus?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5190.125,5190.688,"No, Your Honor they cannot."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5190.688,5191.591,Of course not.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5191.591,5192.635,But as a practical man --
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5192.635,5194.669,Then why you are trying to put them together?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5196.279,5209.14,"No, Your Honor he has been constitutionally deprived of his property and even if it's a smaller amount he's still being deprived of it, and the Court of Claims has jurisdiction to rule upon that, on his constitutional deprivation of salary."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5209.14,5212.9,-- look on whether or not gets his back pay.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5212.9,5215.94,"Well, Your Honor I do not believe it's the equivalent of that in the first place."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5215.94,5218.272,You are going to extend the Court of Claims jurisdiction?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5218.272,5219.073,"No, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5230.701,5232.56,"Oh, that's what you want to do now."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5239.963,5242.02,"Yes, Your Honor I'll do that as soon as this decision --"
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5242.02,5243.806,"Well, have you applied there yet?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5243.806,5244.854,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5244.854,5246.594,And is it being held?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5246.594,5246.878,"No, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5246.878,5247.275,Or have they ruled?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5247.275,5249.431,They denied it and this is another basis for jurisdiction.
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5249.431,5253.141,"They denied it, so you really appealing from that denial aren't you?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5253.141,5254.158,"No, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5385.026,5387.205,Did you go to the Court on Military Appeals?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5387.205,5388.009,No Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5388.782,5389.581,Why not?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5389.581,5393.593,"He had no appeal, he could not take it up, he could not even ask him to review it."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5419.654,5423.508,Do you mean that the Court of Military Appeals had no jurisdiction?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5423.508,5426.866,"That's right Your Honor, not even to consider whether they would review it."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5440.725,5447.367,"That is because of the minor, the minor penalty that was put on his --"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5447.367,5449.145,"Yes Your Honor, yes."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5449.145,5462.388,"Now does that mean that every, every penalty that, in the armed forces, it is so minor that it cannot get to the Court of Military Appeals has a right to go direct to the Court of Claims?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5462.388,5470.183,"Yes, Your Honor, if it's a constitutional depravation, I believe under like Thompson versus City of Louisville where we had a $20 fine."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5473.689,5475.785,I see.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5475.785,5493.317,"Here there was no way, no review he had at all."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5513.762,5518.404,Is there some sort of collateral relief inside the military?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5518.404,5522.295,The Board for the Correction of Military Record is the only thing Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5522.295,5523.889,What section is that under 67?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5523.889,5529.446,1552A 28 U.S.C. -- 10 U.S.C excuse me.
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5530.483,5532.092,What does that involve?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5532.092,5539.799,"Your honor, there the secretary has given the authority to review, to correct any record point in justice."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5539.799,5543.333,Did that involve jury or is that on the record and -?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5543.333,5553.033,"He can do, he can take a hearing, he gathered all the records and he will accept any evidence you have, affidavits or he can also hold a hearing, many times it's just decided just upon the record."
1968.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5553.033,5558.952,"Do you have a board, do we appoint a board for that purpose or -- a permanent board or you have a --"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5558.952,5567.448,"Your honor, I'm not sure of the exact procedure -- they do have someone over here who does this work, who reviews it, and says this is what can be done."
1968.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5580.752,5582.926,That indicates there's a board.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5582.926,5609.671,"Yes Your Honor, through the executive part of that military department may correct any military record of that department when he considers it necessary to correct an error or remove an injustice, and that is then reviewable in the Court of Claims, they considered in this correction statute should we make it final on the courts, in the legislative history and they didn't, they struck that out –"
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5609.671,5617.81,"Could you, are there some jurisdictional limits on what the board can do in the sense could they have reconsidered your case?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5617.81,5621.46,"Yes, Your Honor, they did consider it and deny it."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5626.105,5630.841,You say you could have had your review on the Court of Claims from that?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5630.841,5635.094,"No Your Honor, I could review the Board of Correction of Military Records in the Court of Claims."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5635.094,5636.157,How?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5636.157,5636.718,Because --
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5636.718,5640.653,By filing a suit for back pay?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5640.653,5641.515,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5641.515,5642.495,Which is what you've done?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5642.495,5643.497,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5645.15,5647.589,"Well, now if you're going to do that."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5652.833,5653.983,No Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5653.983,5657.604,Would it be on the record of the board of review?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5657.604,5663.422,"Yes Your Honor, the measurement is whether it's arbitrary and capricious and not supported by substantial evidence."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5663.422,5697.841,"Well, I suppose and following up the question I ask you -- we would have to say, if we agreed with you, that in every conviction, military conviction where the punishment was so small that it could not be reviewed by the Court of Military Appeals that this court would have the responsibility of eventually reviewing these cases just on the record of the military trial."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5697.841,5698.66,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5716.338,5729.729,Is that – that difference between your case and the Augenblick case namely that you did apply to the Board for Correction of Records and had its determination before you went to the Court of Claims.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5729.729,5731.588,"I have two distinctions, that's one Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5731.588,5735.049,"That's one -- but I just want to be sure in the Augenblick case, that did not happen."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5737.556,5739.302,I don't know about Augenblick.
1968.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5750.743,5772.887,"You're saying that whatever may it be, as I understand you now, whatever may be the interpretation on ‘76 that there is review in the Court of Claims of the determination of the Board to correct the records because Congress considered having the same prohibition against judicial review as determinations of that Board and rejected that in this case."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5772.887,5774.494,"Yes, Your Honor, yes Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5774.494,5775.286,Where is that?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5775.286,5779.718,This legislative history as in Ashe v. McNamara that they discuss it --
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5779.718,5786.047,The express statute which grants the Court of Claims this kind of jurisdiction to review appellate jurisdiction?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5786.047,5794.215,"Well, Your Honor the Court of Claims has jurisdiction under any statute treaty or constitution and this would be under a statute."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5794.215,5796.595,"You mean, namely a pay statute?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5796.595,5805.421,"Well, the pay statute and also the Correction Board statute because the secretary under the statute is given authority to correct an error or remove an injustice."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5811.708,5816.921,Now that's -- and your authority for that is what just logic or --?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5816.921,5823.073,"Well, the correction statute and the legislative history Your Honor and the wordings of the two statutes Section 76."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5823.073,5831.497,Do either one of -- does any of the statute say that this kind of a determination may be reviewed in the Court of Claims?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5831.497,5842.341,"No, Your Honor, I know what they say a court-martial specially be reviewed, but they have reviewed, the attorney general says the secretary can review this."
1968.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5846.002,5851.411,Well I suppose if Shapiro was considered by the Congress in the context of all of this.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5856.545,5856.725,Yes.
1968.45,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5856.725,5873.942,"What you are saying is when they came up, as I understand you now, on the applications made for review to the Board of Corrections of Records, that they considered the same kind of the prohibition against additional review that we have in ‘76 and rejected it, is that what you're telling?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5873.942,5874.8,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5883.2,5884.766,You've got that in your brief?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5884.766,5896.105,"Yes Your Honor, well, I've citied in Ashe v. McNamara which has a full discussion of it, which I've referred from Ashe v. McNamara to the legislative history, but in addition one what the difference is --"
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5896.105,5897.933,What brief is that you state your evidence?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5897.933,5906.407,"In Your Honor where -- it's in my brief that a filed here, where I've citied --"
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5906.407,5907.624,This brief?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5907.624,5915.064,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5915.064,5917.837,Here it is.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5917.837,5926.916,"Yes that -- Your Honor on page 14 of my brief, on the second paragraph the --"
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5926.916,5931.538,"Mr. Steiner you've filed more than a memorandum on opposition, didn't you?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,5931.538,5932.063,Yes Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6011.746,6016.791,"To what extent must, must it be corroborated?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6016.791,6029.601,"I think with any corroboration Your Honor that its corroboration but you can't read just, for example the testimonies of the people who said, yes he was out here, but he didn't engage in any of this activity."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6077.903,6078.748,You say the other man --
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6078.748,6085.053,"Yes, the other, the other possible collaborator, in other words he contradicting on everything and –-"
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6085.053,6087.782,The fact they were contradicted with the --
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6087.782,6088.661,"No, Your Honor but --"
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6088.661,6089.856,They told it?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6089.856,6099.562,"Yes, Your Honor but that has to be corroborate -- in other words he didn't corroborate on any of the criminal factors and Hughes didn't repeat that testimony at the trial."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6099.562,6101.439,Who said the cigars --?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6101.439,6102.377,This was the Article 33.
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6102.377,6104.956,Who said the cigars were in the front seat?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6104.956,6108.902,"Hughes, Hughes, the name the name of accomplish, the man we complain off."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6109.726,6112.636,The car in which the defendant was when they went to sell this --
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6112.636,6115.069,"Yes Your Honor, He said they were sitting in the front seat."
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6115.498,6117.434,Now why isn't that that corroboration?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6117.434,6122.78,"That's his testimony, his testimony has to be corroborating."
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6135.567,6137.841,For the courtwide reasons -- now let me ask you –
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6137.841,6138.582,Yes Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6138.582,6168.332,"Now I understand you now to be fair that despite the conviction, despite the Board of Appeals in the military, there is still a limit provided in a Code section for an examination by a board and if they decide against the man, the soldier there, he can have that reviewed in the Court of Appeal in the Court of Claim."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6168.332,6169.271,Yes Your Honor that's correct.
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6169.271,6171.98,What is that code section that authorize it?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6171.98,6181.043,10USCA 1552(a) I've cited it on page 2 of my brief.
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6183.477,6186.655,Has the government said anything about that in its brief?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6186.655,6197.035,"Well Your Honor they say that this, well this is okay for the secretary to do it, but it doesn't, they didn't mean to vary but there is no provision, that they didn't mean that a Court could then review it."
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6197.781,6205.189,"In Court of Claims do you say it authorizes the Court of Claims, is that set out anywhere in your brief or you just refer to it."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6205.189,6207.326,"No, this is one of my basic arguments Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6207.326,6211.01,But is it set out in your brief in the Court section?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6211.01,6213.135,"Yes Your Honor it is, I've cited."
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6213.135,6214.964,But is it quoted?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6214.964,6216.158,Yes Your Honor it's quoted.
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6216.158,6217.034,Where?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6217.034,6219.303,On page 2.
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6219.303,6220.367,Of the reply brief?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6220.367,6221.891,Yes Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6221.891,6223.794,1552 (A).
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6223.794,6226.61,But it doesn't say anything about the Court of Claims.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6226.61,6227.487,No Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6229.842,6230.307,Well does that say?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6230.307,6233.392,Will be filed just on officers and that they consider will it be on court --
1968.45,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6233.392,6235.042,It says officers.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6235.042,6237.889,It says officers and they deleted courts.
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6237.889,6242.106,"Well and then say it in the statute and the Court of Claims have never done it, is that right?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6242.106,6243.046,Pardon me Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6243.046,6252.609,"It doesn't say in the statute and the Court of Claims has never reviewed that sort of a determination, am I right or wrong?"
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6252.609,6257.506,"You are right on that, that they have never reviewed a court-martial but two circuits have, two circuits have and --"
1968.45,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6257.506,6274.637,"No, but you were saying Court of Claims and in fact of the matter is statute does not mention the Court of Claims and the Court of Claims has never have reviewed it, has never exercised power that I understood you to assert that it has."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6274.637,6288.086,"Well Your Honor I think if they were faced with a case directly in point, well that was the only basis they would construe it that way, now that's just conjecture but they haven't ruled that I know, that no this prohibits us from reviewing it."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6296.065,6298.015,Was that involved in the Ashe case.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6298.015,6299.212,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6302.804,6305.002,Plus the 28 U.S code.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6305.002,6306.623,Yes sir.
1968.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6306.623,6310.49,Now these two circuits that have that -- what cases are those?
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6310.49,6319.02,The First and Tenth Circuit Your Honor Ashe versus McNamara.
1968.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6319.02,6319.926,Uh-huh.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6319.926,6324.034,"Which is 3355 Federal Second 277, yes Your Honor."
1968.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6324.034,6326.786,That's First circuit and the Tenth circuit case is.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6326.786,6333.443,Is Smith versus McNamara 395 F Second 896.
1968.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6333.443,6338.024,"Well, I thought those are habeas corpus cases."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6338.024,6350.895,"No, Your Honor these were under the correction board statue Ashe for example was not in fact -- and they didn't hold in its favor and Smith, but they ruled they had jurisdiction in accordance of Ashe."
1968.45,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6350.895,6351.94,Thank you.
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6351.94,6361.94,I take it there would be any limit on the nature of the attack which the secretary of the board under this section could have entertained.
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6361.94,6364.365,The secretary could do anything Your Honor I believe.
1968.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6364.365,6387.984,"Under this section, he could just say –- he can say there has been an error here, because there wasn't enough evidence to sustain my conviction by the court-martial and the -– and so the Secretary could if he wanted to despite 76 review the evidence and then you would say the court might review him."
1968.45,2,24616,francis_j_steiner,,6387.984,6393.217,Yes Your Honor.
1968.45,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6395.668,6398.259,Mr. Weisl.
1968.45,3,23379,edwin_l_weisl,,6398.259,6401.403,Very briefly Chief Justice --
1968.45,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6401.403,6405.268,Was the certiorari sought in that Ashe you remember --
1968.45,3,23379,edwin_l_weisl,,6405.268,6420.372,"I don't believe it was Mr. Justice Douglas, the speaker as to the board question that has been the subject to extensive examination by the court -- there is a discussion in our brief of footnote 31 on page 46."
1968.45,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6449.427,6453.723,"Mr. Weisl -- what does this mean, I am reading from Ashe."
1968.45,3,23379,edwin_l_weisl,,6472.924,6476.584,I think that case is clearly wrong to the extent that it says if you can review a board.
1968.45,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6476.584,6478.331,But it is contrary to your position.
1968.45,3,23379,edwin_l_weisl,,6478.331,6478.966,Yes sir.
1968.45,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6478.966,6480.093,I see.
1968.45,3,23379,edwin_l_weisl,,6481.736,6486.05,"Your Honor, I think you'll see it from the Court of Claims decision in Juhl that there are two questions --"
1968.45,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6486.05,6496.199,"Can I ask then before -- what about the other case, was there any proceeding before the Augenblick case, any effort to get a proceeding before a correction board in that case?"
1968.45,3,23379,edwin_l_weisl,,6496.199,6501.846,"To the best of my knowledge, there was not --"
1968.45,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6501.846,6505.879,I don't see any conflict in Ashe and your position here.
1968.45,3,23379,edwin_l_weisl,,6505.879,6521.373,"Here no, but I said if the question arose again whether the board for the correction of records could be reviewed in court when they have corrected a court-martial, we would urge that Article 76 bars judicial review of that board Ashe."
1968.45,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6622.071,6624.096,Thank you Gentlemen.
