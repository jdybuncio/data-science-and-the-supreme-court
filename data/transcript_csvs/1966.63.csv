1966.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.736,"Number 63, Bank of Marin, petitioner versus John M. England trustee of bankruptcy."
1966.63,0,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,21.563,24.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, may the Court please."
1966.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,57.206,58.551,No notice and no knowledge.
1966.63,0,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,58.551,60.66,No notice and no knowledge.
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,1660.649,1664.516,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1806.945,1812.794,May I ask what is your interest in the outcome of the suit?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,1812.794,1820.651,"Well, I am here Your Honor for two reasons, one as an officer of this Court and as an officer of the bankruptcy court."
1966.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1857.572,1863.567,"In other words, you want some guidelines on how you shall act in the future?"
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,1863.567,1866.618,"Yes, that's the second half of it Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1867.154,1870.875,And that is advisory verdict revised with the judgment?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,1870.875,1884.096,"I do not believe sir, Your Honor for this reason I agree 100% with the court that there is nothing that we can gain by your decision in this case."
1966.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1902.507,1904.995,"Well, now you're pleading for the petitioner?"
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,1904.995,1910.544,"No, I'm simply accepting his position as far as this -- your question goes."
1966.63,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1949.717,1953.91,And that distresses as a trustee in bankruptcy?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,1953.91,1955.727,"No, that doesn't bother me a bit."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.249,1989.693,You mean whether you have to go after the -- whether you can go after the bank rather than the payee?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,1989.693,1995.549,"Well, that question is not here, the question is whether we can go after the bank because then --"
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.549,1998.249,You want to be able to go after the bank?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,1998.249,1998.29,Yes.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.29,2003.892,"That is, you want to be able to -- you don't want to be left if you can go after anybody to be go -- to go after the payee?"
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2003.892,2004.451,Yes.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.451,2008.208,You want to -- all is to be able to go to the bank and let the bank chase the payee?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2008.208,2014.488,If the bank is liable under the statute we do not want our right as attorneys for trustees to be precluded.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.488,2034.181,"Well, do you think one reason for this is that unless you can -- and that this -- that if you can go after the bank, the bank pays you the money and the bank -- the money that the bank has paid the payee remains with the payee and the bank can't get it back which means there's some -- well, that's the claim against the assets."
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2034.181,2035.683,Yes Your Honor.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.816,2044.307,"That really -- I mean it, the reason it really does do some good is -- it is because the bank does pay twice."
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2044.307,2051.408,The bank is a better defendant in any lawsuit as far as solvency goes than most other defendants.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.408,2055.286,"You mean, what -- it could afford to pay twice?"
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2055.286,2059.592,"No, that is not what I said."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.449,2065.397,This kind of a lawsuit only comes up when the bank has already paid the payee?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2065.397,2074.522,"Yes Your Honor, but it might very well come up in a situation where the -- for example in this case we had four people that we could have pursued."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.685,2112.087,A simple case is just where there are some checks outstanding at the time of bankruptcy.
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2116.933,2117.437,Yes.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.437,2127.708,And -- was then -- then the payee pockets the money and the trustee finds out that the check has paid after bankruptcy and he asks for the money back in the bank.
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2133.423,2145.838,"The bank's cause of action against the payee Mr. Justice White is for -- as we point out in our brief, it's paid out money under a mistake of fact."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.277,2169.379,"Now, but the payee is liable to say, ""Well, now look, at the time I got the check, bankruptcy has not been filed and it was a cash sale."
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2174.425,2175.291,"Yes, now this --"
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.291,2182.411,"And the bank -- and he says, ""I didn't -- I should be able to keep the money."""
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2182.411,2193.342,"Your Honor you've led me into the answer to your question which you had asked my opponent, wasn't this a preference of the -- this question is not involved here."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.823,2204.971,Alright.
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2204.971,2207.884,It's a -- it is considered a cash payment.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.884,2216.87,"Alright, so in that case, in my case where the payee has made a cash sale before or a cash -- yes, say under bankrupt, just before bankruptcy."
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2224.514,2226.375,"Unless -- that's right, that's right."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.957,2229.925,And then you wanted -- you want -- you have to be able to get the money from the bank?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2229.925,2236.673,"But you see -- that again is not this case Your Honor, this case -- there was no money in the bank at the date of bankruptcy."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.673,2240.164,"Yes, but the rule, it's established (Inaudible) for that case."
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2240.164,2251.859,"No, this is precisely why I believe that the Section 70d(5) provides that nothing in this Act shall impair the negotiability of currency or negotiable instrument."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.811,2288.976,Did they pay the holder in due course?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2288.976,2312.283,"The payee would be a holder in due course and he would have -- he may be -- also the recipient of a preference, he may not be, that we do not know but if he is, he's going to have to pay back under the bankruptcy law even though under negotiable instrument law he's a holder in due course if he is not the recipient of a preference."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.993,2323.202,And the bank must to pay two.
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2323.202,2334.649,The bank has to pay for this reason Your Honor because at the time of bankruptcy these assets if we may speculate about what happened here and I think we have to.
1966.63,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2385.389,2394.821,Would you be making up this argument though if in fact the deposits had been made before bankruptcy?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2394.821,2398.867,"No, I would make the same argument, yes."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.515,2409.373,The fact -- that in this case the --
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2409.373,2409.427,Yes.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.427,2415.795,-- deposit were in fact made after bankruptcy is immaterial on legal questions?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2415.795,2417.945,"Yes, yes sir."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.945,2434.686,"What you are saying in effect is as a bank, even though it knows nothing about bankruptcy is liable to pay valid checks with which the depositor has presented -- paid to somebody and presented to the bank."
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2434.686,2435.522,Yes Mr. Justice White.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.522,2438.068,Makes no difference whether it knows it or not?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2438.068,2439.308,Precisely.
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.308,2442.402,May I ask you something about the judgment?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2457.401,2464.2,"Yes, to go off the record again sir, the bank or we don't have to go off the record, it is in the record."
1966.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.2,2465.1,It's on the record?
1966.63,1,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2465.1,2465.277,Yes.
1966.63,2,29985,justice_douglas:,,2465.277,2468.137,As I understand (Inaudible).
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2468.137,2486.162,"On Oct -- September 30th, 1963, John England was appointed as receiver and at that time examined the record in the bankruptcy court and he determined that there was a bank account in the Bank of Marin and he sent a notice dated October 2nd to the Bank of Marin."
1966.63,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.434,2494.975,"Well, what about the 700?"
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2494.975,2511.131,"Now, on October 3rd, the bank received the notice from Mr. England and notwithstanding it had notice of the bankruptcy, it continued to honor checks against this account to the tune of $700."
1966.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2511.965,2514.01,Has the bank appealed that part of the judgment?
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2514.01,2516.515,"No, the bank has paid that part of the judgment."
1966.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2516.515,2520.448,So that we on there -- the $2000 judgment.
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2520.448,2523.691,Yes sir.
1966.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2523.691,2528.956,What would happen if we were to -- got told there that the bank is not liable?
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2528.956,2538.742,The Court of Appeals asked us same question on argument and it asked for further briefs on that particular question.
1966.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2565.97,2568.547,Suppose we hold the bank is not liable?
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2568.547,2569.501,Is not liable.
1966.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2569.501,2570.599,Yes.
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2570.599,2573.09,Well this would be very serious.
1966.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2573.09,2576.334,That is very serious.
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2576.334,2584.357,Not -- it would not be serious -- I didn't mean to be funny.
1966.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2596.032,2602.713,"Well, you're not thinking of the payee, not very serious for him, you mean very serious in the bankruptcy law."
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2602.713,2603.033,Yes.
1966.63,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2603.033,2603.439,That's --
1966.63,3,42632,thomas_b_donovan,,2603.439,2604.158,Yes.
1966.63,4,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,3914.594,3915.462,Mr. Chief Justice --
1966.63,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3915.462,3918.979,-- you have a few moments left.
1966.63,4,23361,edgar_b_washburn,,3918.979,3926.326,"I think from the questions asked by the court to Mr. Donovan, the court fully understands the position of the bank."
