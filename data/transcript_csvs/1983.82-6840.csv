1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.504,We will hear arguments next in James v. Kentucky.
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,11.539,14.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,71.594,92.191,"Was there anything to prevent counsel, when the court ruled, to say I intend my motion in the sense of an instruction, an admonition or an instruction, in the alternative, treating them, even though they are not, treating them as though they are synonyms?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,92.191,103.999,"Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, there is nothing requiring counsel from asking for relief in the alternative."
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,103.999,105.515,Nothing preventing him.
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,105.515,136.134,"Nothing preventing him, and certainly there was nothing preventing the trial court from performing its obligation that once it was put on notice that the defendant wanted some sort of jury guidance, no matter how that jury guidance is phrased, whether as an admonition, an oral, authoritative communication to the jury, or as an instruction in writing containing the law of the case, certainly I think the judge was on notice as to the relief that the defendant wanted."
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,232.86,237.847,"Well, when you emphasize one, would it have made any difference if there were eight of them?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,237.847,241.616,I think it would have made a difference depending upon where those fingerprints were.
1983.82-6840,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.356,314.561,"Mr. Hectus, was the defendant in the case below represented by different counsel at trial?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,314.561,315.829,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-6840,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.829,329.137,"And counsel, for whatever reason, did not request a written or present the court with a written instruction in this regard?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,329.137,331.356,"No, but I would like to point out to you--"
1983.82-6840,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.356,343.497,"And Kentucky law, I take it, is perfectly clear that only written instructions will be given and that counsel has to present written instructions?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,343.497,349.968,--It is perfectly clear that the trial court has an obligation to instruct the jury in writing.
1983.82-6840,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.5,373.1,And in Kentucky law... all right.
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,381.356,382.456,Absolutely.
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,545.188,566.453,"Sometimes a judge's ruling on that score in that stage is to prevent error getting into the case right at the outset because of the view that that is a good way, a good way to call attention to the failure to testify by having a great deal of discussion about it when they are picking a jury."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,566.453,579.694,"--That may be, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think in this point, the trial judge's response to his attempt to do that was that the jurors have already been instructed that they are to decide this case on the law and the evidence."
1983.82-6840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.919,598.924,"At what stage did your client request the admonition to the jury, Mr. Hectus?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,598.924,604.509,"At the close of all the evidence, and apparently during the instruction conference."
1983.82-6840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.509,617.302,"So that if his request for an instruction had been given... for an admonition had been granted by the trial court, the trial court would have admonished the jury presumably at the next time the jury was brought in, which might have--"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,617.302,621.604,"Presumably, immediately prior to his giving the law of the case in instruction."
1983.82-6840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,621.604,626.408,--And are there written instructions given to the jury in Kentucky?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,626.408,627.608,"Yes, as an--"
1983.82-6840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.608,630.094,So that the jury takes the--
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,630.094,635.264,--The normal practice is to give a copy of the written instructions to jurors.
1983.82-6840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.264,643.453,"--Under your client's request the admonition, being oral, would not have gone in writing."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,643.453,657.527,"Assuming that the request for an admonition wasn't an inadvertent use of the word, or request for an instruction, yes, then I assume that he wanted them to be orally admonished right then and there prior to the instructions."
1983.82-6840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,657.527,665.8,"Well, you are not suggesting, are you, that the trial court was obligated to determine whether the lawyer's request was inadvertent?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,665.8,666.183,Not at all.
1983.82-6840,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,704.075,706.81,"Well, I come back to the practice in Kentucky."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,713.864,717.002,"--I don't think that's unusual at all, Mr. Justice Powell."
1983.82-6840,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,717.002,719.954,And the court makes its own instructions without any help from counsel?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,719.954,733.361,"Usually during the instruction conference, instructions are discussed, and most instructions, from my practice in Kentucky, including some--"
1983.82-6840,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,733.361,737.665,What do you discuss if there is nothing in writing?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,737.665,742.467,"--Well, for example, lesser included offenses, whether or not--"
1983.82-6840,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,742.467,747.454,Was this particular question of admonition discussed in this conference?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,747.454,748.221,--Apparently it was.
1983.82-6840,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,748.754,752.889,"It's not clear from the record, to me, as I read it."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,752.889,776.754,"--The record apparently was not made during the instruction conference, but when the proceedings went back on the record, defense counsel indicated that there had been a request for an admonition on the defendant's failure to testify, and the apparent request for a no inference admonition."
1983.82-6840,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,791.431,795.985,Did counsel except on the record to the overruling by the judge?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,795.985,799.27,There is no requirement in Kentucky for exceptions.
1983.82-6840,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,799.27,799.77,In Kentucky.
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,799.77,828.956,"The reason I think that the whole notion of instructions and the request for the admonition in Kentucky is not really important is because the Kentucky practice, as this Court is aware I think from cases like Taylor v. Kentucky, is to give very spartan and skeletal instructions, in this Court's own language, they give very brief instructions which have only to do with the elements of the crime, which come right out of the statute book."
1983.82-6840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.039,880.139,"Well, it might actually, if one were looking at the thing from some other planet, spare, skeletal instructions might be better than these convoluted things you see some courts give where, you know, the presumption of innocence takes fifteen pages to define, and the jurors are all asleep at the end of the definitions."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,880.139,884.457,I Would respectfully assert that I would prefer the fleshed cut sort.
1983.82-6840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.457,892.279,"And in some places, years ago, the instructions were in effect do what you want to, I mean, do what you think is just."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,892.279,899.3,"Nonetheless, I think that now there are at least certain constitutional prerequisites."
1983.82-6840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.284,931.072,"Mr. Hectus, before you do that, let me just ask one question similar to the one Justice Powell asked."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,955.553,962.459,--I think that the Kentucky Supreme Court and the Commonwealth of Kentucky per the Attorney General's Office have assumed that that was the state of affairs.
1983.82-6840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.459,963.009,I see.
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,969.697,971.165,Prior to instructions.
1983.82-6840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.165,971.815,"--I mean, at the same time."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,971.815,972.499,"Prior to instructions, right."
1983.82-6840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.312,996.597,"And the oral admonition and the oral instructions are given consecutively, right together."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,996.597,998.632,Assuming that there are any admonitions to give.
1983.82-6840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.632,1000.501,"Right, okay."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1000.501,1003.12,"Moving on with the evidence, after Ms. Richardson testified--"
1983.82-6840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1003.12,1011.207,"Counsel, in Kentucky practice, is there just one copy of the written instructions that goes into the jury room, or does each juror get a copy?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1011.207,1012.141,--There is not a rule on it.
1983.82-6840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1025.783,1026.133,All right.
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1029.268,1034.072,With regard to the... with regard to the instructions?
1983.82-6840,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1034.072,1036.591,Of written instructions going into the jury room?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1036.591,1037.807,I don't think that it's novel.
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1310.208,1318.23,"Well, an alibi witness would contradict, too, or ten alibi witnesses if he was off at a football game with them."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1327.752,1343.195,"--I think under the circumstances of this particular case where the defendant's evidence was limited to the rape charge and there wasn't any evidence on the other charges, that that had to be considered by the jury as a reference to the defendant, even though--"
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1343.195,1344.963,Did he bring in any alibi witnesses?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1344.963,1347.113,--As to those charges?
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1347.113,1351.931,Did he bring any alibi witnesses saying he was somewhere else at the time?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1351.931,1352.681,"No, sir."
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1352.681,1356.902,"Well, such witnesses could contradict."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1356.902,1363.139,"If such witnesses were available, but then, we don't know whether they were available or not or why he did not."
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1363.589,1372.611,"Well, I suppose a fact-finder or a judge or anyone else in the courtroom would assume the reason they didn't bring alibi witnesses is because there weren't any."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1372.611,1381.198,"--Right, and that's exactly the point, Mr. Chief Justice, that they would assume that the reason he didn't bring any evidence forward and the reason he didn't testify was because he guilty."
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1385.268,1392.655,"Of course, a great many people think that's what juries do, no matter what any judge instructs or admonishes them."
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1392.655,1405.248,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, all I can say is that I would agree with the Court's statement in Lakeside that the Court has yet not come to a conclusion that juries are going to disregard admonitions or instructions of the court."
1983.82-6840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.594,1426.261,Nor does Griffin.
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1439.153,1470.024,"--I think Carter simply stands for the proposition that Mr. Justice Stevens and Mr. Justice Brennan stated in their concurring opinion that whether... I take that back... in Lakeside, that whether or not the jury is going to be given any guidance on the failure to testify is going to be up to counsel and the defendant, and in this particular case, it's obvious that counsel and the defendant requested some jury guidance and were denied it."
1983.82-6840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.583,1685.756,"Is your basic argument, Mr. Hectus, that your client was entitled to an instruction because he had requested something almost like an instruction or that he was entitled to an admonition because he had requested an admonition?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1685.756,1694.612,"My basic argument is that he was entitled to an admonition, at the very least."
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.472,1876.757,Was there a motion for a directed verdict on that count?
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1876.757,1879.226,--There was a motion for a directed verdict as to all counts.
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.226,1882.761,"Well, not separately as to some?"
1983.82-6840,0,19129,c_thomas_hectus,,1882.761,1894.569,"No, sir, it wasn't articulated such that it broke the... that defense counsel broke down the evidence as to each charge, but he did move for a directed verdict of acquittal after the Commonwealth's evidence and after the state's evidence."
1983.82-6840,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.869,1902.523,Ms. Warren?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,1902.523,1907.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-6840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1937.396,1937.896,What page are you on?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,1937.896,1938.546,--Pardon me?
1983.82-6840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1938.546,1939.114,What page are you on?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,1939.114,1970.05,"On page 1a in the Addendum, Your Honor, and this is Petitioner's brief before the state court... the trial court refused to admonish the jury, and then the first sentence, Appellant, by counsel, requested that an admonition be given, and on page 2a at the top, appellant submits that the requested admonition is now constitutionally mandated, and in their footnote that trial counsel apparently requested an admonition rather than a written instruction."
1983.82-6840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.05,1972.252,"Where are you, Ms. Warren, in the--"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,1972.252,1973.485,Respondent's brief.
1983.82-6840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.437,1974.971,--The back part?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,1974.971,1978.056,"Yes, sir, the addendum reproduces the state court brief."
1983.82-6840,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1978.056,1979.889,Thank you.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2008.158,2042.598,"Justice O'Connor, in Kentucky the term ""admonition"" means only an oral comment by the judge for two purposes: one, a curative purpose to eliminate from the jury's consideration evidence that was improperly presented to them, the classic example being incriminating impeachment evidence, to limit their consideration only for impeachment purposes; and the other purpose of an admonition is to guide the jury as to their duties, you are not to speak with others outside of the courtroom."
1983.82-6840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.739,2065.345,Do I judge from your answer to Justice O'Connor's question the admonitions are really something that occurs during the testimony of witnesses--
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2065.345,2065.78,Yes.
1983.82-6840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.78,2074.134,"--such as the objection is sustained and the jury admonished to disregard it, that it really fulfills quite a different function, it isn't just an oral instruction?"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2074.134,2074.636,That's correct.
1983.82-6840,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2079.788,2086.108,"And yet in Kentucky practice on may have oral instructions, may he not, if he asks for them?"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2086.108,2086.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-6840,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2090.328,2092.045,Is quite what?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2092.045,2093.38,--Quite old.
1983.82-6840,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2101.25,2103.502,"Well, I was living in 1912 and--"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2103.502,2133.788,"My comment was that the... now the rules of procedure say, you know, shall be written, and I don't know that the Kentucky court, after 70 years of experience with the written instructions, would now say that they may be waived, but in fact they do, and it is the law in Kentucky today, you may waive written... if there is a clear waiver... and all instructions are given orally, all are given alike."
1983.82-6840,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2133.788,2138.075,--Would that require waiver by the state as well as the defendant?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2138.075,2144.496,"According to current case law, it appears to be only the defendant--"
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.496,2149.165,May I ask you a question about the material that you called our attention to at the beginning of your argument?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2149.165,2149.9,--Yes.
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.9,2165.909,"That, as I read it, it really is just a repetition of the colloquy that is found on page 11 of your brief where the defendant merely said the defendant requested an admonition be given to the jury that no emphasis be given to the defendant's failure to testify, which was overruled."
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2170.98,2172.496,"Yes, sir, but--"
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.496,2177.031,So do we have anything in the record other than that one sentence about what really happened here?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2177.031,2179.333,--I believe we do have some inferences.
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.333,2180.4,Do you have some--
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2180.4,2181.685,"No, we do not have an expression."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.685,2183.668,--No quotation in the transcript?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2183.668,2184.387,No quotation.
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.087,2192.308,"Well, then, do you disagree with your opponent's reading of this as something that was requested during the conference on instructions?"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2192.308,2199.063,"--I believe it was requested during the conference because of the choice of terms, which was overruled, yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2199.063,2205.567,"Yes, so that it was asked by the defendant's lawyer as something to be given to the jury along with the written instructions."
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2209.685,2216.239,It would have been an oral comment by the court preceding the reading of the instructions.
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.239,2217.025,Immediately preceding.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2217.025,2218.941,And then the instructions--
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.941,2219.727,Immediately preceding the instruction.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2219.727,2220.427,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.427,2222.762,Because the instructions were given right after that comment.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2222.762,2224.362,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.08,2310.134,Would it have been error as a matter of Kentucky law for the judge to have given the admonition he had requested?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2310.134,2311.784,"--Yes, Your Honor, it would have been."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.784,2312.301,It would have been?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2312.301,2317.019,Because instructions must be given in writing; this is an instructional--
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.019,2322.923,"And if the judge orally tells the jury something that he doesn't put in writing, he commits error?"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2322.923,2323.489,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.489,2324.089,It's a rather strange procedure.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2324.089,2330.177,"Oral instructions, separate, isolated oral instruction is not permitted in Kentucky."
1983.82-6840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2398.304,2399.221,Ms. Warren.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2399.221,2400.089,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-6840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2400.089,2407.41,Is there a decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court says that an oral request for instruction is not appropriate?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2407.41,2408.393,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-6840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2410.629,2411.079,"Oh, well--"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2411.079,2423.704,"Oral instructions, a separate, isolated oral instruction or an instruction given by way of an admonition are not appropriate, Your Honor, and I believe there are some cases cited in the brief."
1983.82-6840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2423.704,2427.84,"--So you don't have to write out anything, he just has to ask him to give an instruction."
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2427.84,2434.26,"Good practice is to prepare written instructions so that there is something to discuss in that charging conference, but no, it is not required."
1983.82-6840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2445.618,2446.951,"Well, I find this record very confusing."
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2457.776,2459.826,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-6840,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2464.846,2466.531,"Well, that's just one element."
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2472.851,2490.83,"The position of Kentucky in this case is that the defendant had available to him a constitutionally adequate vehicle to protect his Fifth Amendment right, but now he insists that he has a right to ride in every other car going in the same direction so long as it serves that underlying purpose."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.073,2563.773,May I go back to my confusion about Kentucky law for a minute?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2563.773,2564.275,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.275,2569.51,I understood you to tell me that it would be error in Kentucky to give an oral instruction on the law.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2569.51,2575.647,"Yes, a defendant may waive all written instructions under Kentucky law, and all--"
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.647,2587.806,"But could he not waive a... your brief at pages 24 and 25 quote the law as I understand it to say that if it is clear that the defendant was satisfied to have the instruction be given orally, that there is no error."
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2587.806,2596.829,"--That applies to all... all instructions may be given orally or all written, but we found no authority that would suggest that you should isolate one and pull it out."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.829,2610.237,"But is there any authority in Kentucky for the proposition that if the defendant asks for one oral instruction, as he did here, or you call it an admonition, and the judge gives it, that that would be error?"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2610.237,2612.005,"There is not a case on that point, Your Honor."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.541,2618.908,So there is no consistent body of state law that supports that.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2618.908,2623.729,There is a body of state law that says that there must be a clear waiver--
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.729,2627.098,The instruction should be in writing unless the defendant asks for it to be oral.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2627.098,2627.548,--Waives.
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.998,2631.233,And here he asked for it to be oral.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2631.233,2641.858,"--He asked for this particular... he asked for an admonition which is a term of art in Kentucky meaning an oral comment, not an instruction, but an oral comment by the court."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2734.217,2740.553,"But can you really call this an ingenious defense remedy, saying he wants this particular admonition?"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2740.553,2741.353,In that it was--
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.353,2742.405,Why wouldn't the judge give it?
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2744.155,2751.328,"--Your Honor, I am at a disadvantage, and we are all at a disadvantage because we do not know what was discussed before."
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.28,2758.915,We don't know if the judge said you can have it in writing if you want it but you can't have it orally.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2759.498,2761.381,--I believe the... I'm sorry.
1983.82-6840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.381,2764.133,--That's what you are assuming he must have said something like that.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2764.133,2778.976,"Yes, Your Honor, and again, during that early discussion when there was some confusion about what the defense attorney wanted, when we were talking about the persistent felony offender issue, when the judge had some confusion, he clarified and he repeatedly asked defense counsel."
1983.82-6840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2794.963,2804.955,"Well, in Kentucky do you... I take it that you regard the term ""admonition"" as being something of less force than an instruction."
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2804.955,2805.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-6840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.455,2808.057,Other than the technical differences you are talking about.
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2808.057,2816.495,It serves very different purposes and also is not that directive on the law to be applied by the jury in their deliberations.
1983.82-6840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2820.314,2832.036,"Well, do you think in Kentucky a juror or a jury can have greater latitude in disregarding an admonition than an instruction?"
1983.82-6840,1,38412,penny_r_warren,,2832.036,2850.948,"They certainly must follow the advice and caution of the trial court, but I believe in Kentucky that all instructions are presented in a unified manner, whether it be all oral or all written, and in my practice, I have never seen any request for an oral instruction at all."
1983.82-6840,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3071.134,3071.884,"Thank you, Counsel."
