1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3281.112,3307.924,"Your Honors, you've just enjoyed a -- an extraordinarily fair statement of the facts in the record from Mr. Schober as to the basic facts in his presentation, I have no quarrel.Some of the inferences that he draws principally in his briefs more or so than here on the argument this afternoon, I do quarrel."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3475.084,3477.052,What is the police -- 28 police department?
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3479.224,3482.136,"There are 28 separate police departments in the county, Your Honor."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3482.136,3482.896,"Oh, I know."
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3488.835,3491.509,"Well, some of the departments are quite small."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3492.115,3492.145,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3492.145,3501.92,-- more than uniform patrol groups but some of the departments like the county police have seven or eight precincts maybe 150 or 200 men in each precinct.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3501.92,3503.958,Is the department a functional division of (Voice Overlap) --
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3503.958,3505.304,A functional division --
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3505.304,3506.054,I see.
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3506.054,3512.323,-- and with independent authority.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3523.302,3524.579,About 10 o'clock?
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3524.879,3526.005,"About 9 o'clock, Your Honor."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3526.005,3526.723,9 o'clock.
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3526.723,3530.403,The testimony of Rouffet is not too clear.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3546.409,3553.652,"They were -- the -- when -- through the inference that they were rather waiting for the return from these tests, isn't that right?"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3553.652,3555.601,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3559.225,3559.383,Yes.
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3559.383,3563.254,-- whether Inspector -- when Inspector Pribell finished these test.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3563.254,3566.167,I thought it was -- I thought (Inaudible) what is his name?
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3566.167,3567.309,Dr. (Inaudible)
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3567.309,3571.509,"I thought he testified that by 8 o'clock, they had it, didn't they?"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3571.509,3575.161,By 8 o'clock they had taken the samples but then --
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3575.161,3578.342,And they have to have these arguments (Inaudible)
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3578.342,3579.556,"That is right, Your Honor."
1959.497,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3597.652,3599.739,"All were negative, were they?"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3599.739,3601.538,"All were negative, Your Honor."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3689.939,3696.294,"Mr. Heneghan, you said a minute ago that the murder investigation didn't begin or until about 9 o'clock, is that right?"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3696.294,3698.3,"Well, I would say the questioning --"
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3698.3,3699.158,"Questioning, that the --"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3699.158,3700.574,-- in a murder investigation.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3700.574,3706.141,"Didn't begin until 9, the fact that there was murder to be investigated was clear at 5."
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3706.141,3707.638,"That is true, Your Honor."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3707.638,3711.986,And how do you account for the hours between 5 or 9?
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3711.986,3724.642,"The record -- the testimony of both Detectives Stock the homicide squad and Inspector Pribell show that once the body was located, they proceeded to the scene of the crime."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3756.83,3758.86,"The body was found about at 5 o'clock, petitioner --"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3758.86,3765.229,And they were -- the body was discovered by a railroad worker around 4 o'clock.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3767.527,3767.771,No.
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3771.893,3779.002,"It was until sometime after 5 apparently, that Stock and Pribell arrived at the scene."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3779.002,3788.079,"And then -- then they took the body, an investigation -- an autopsy was made of the body, wasn't there?"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3788.079,3788.624,Yes.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3790.17,3800.283,"And then there were also various samples of necessary evidence to make test of the child's body or what had taken place there, wasn't it?"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3800.283,3800.654,Yes.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3801.442,3804.532,"Well, I suppose that accounts to intervening time?"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3804.532,3806.93,"Well, there, again, the record isn't clear as to --"
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3806.93,3809.334,"But I say that probably account, one can't tell."
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3809.334,3810.041,You can't tell --
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3810.041,3812.19,"There isn't a timetable in the record, is there?"
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3812.19,3812.531,"No, there is not Your Honor."
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3812.531,3817.224,I mean there is an -- a timetable to be worked out to the record.
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3817.224,3817.664,Yes.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3820.952,3821.085,Approximately.
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3821.085,3822.058,-- but not for all.
1959.497,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3822.058,3825.872,Yes.
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3825.872,3837.763,I believe -- I was talking about the interruptions or the lapses in the questioning of the petitioner as a suspect in a murder.
1959.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3849.064,3850.356,What time was that please?
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3850.356,3863.215,That must -- sometime between 3:30 and 4:30 apparently was the questioning conducted by the chief of detectives.
1959.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3863.215,3866.3,They are not -- they knew nothing of the body at that time.
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3866.3,3867.24,"Yes they did, Your Honor."
1959.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3869.783,3870.464,"Oh, a.m."
1959.497,1,30687,joseph_i_heneghan,,3870.464,3871.14,A.m.
1959.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3871.14,3871.753,"Oh, yes."
