1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.447,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-6146, Angel Monge v. California."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,68.027,71.669,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-6146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.547,102.76,"Could you in other States, or is that a peculiarity under California law, or is this just a rule of finality that prevails, you think, in most jurisdictions?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,104.643,106.386,My guess is that it's a rule of finality.
1997.97-6146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,106.386,107.547,"Newly discovered evidence, can't you--"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,107.547,113.671,"Well, there could be a collateral attack, certainly, but I could not go in in the absence of some kind of new evidence."
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.494,121.177,--But any number of collateral attacks might be possible.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,121.177,121.407,Certainly.
1997.97-6146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,141.432,150.989,"Well, does California have... in your first hypothetical, assuming you lose and you find there was something wrong, there was not really a prior conviction, there's no motion to modify the sentence?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,159.427,163.618,"He could seek a writ of habeas corpus, or if the trial court still had jurisdiction, perhaps."
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.141,170.223,And of course the State can't collaterally attack the sentence.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,172.887,177.578,There is... under the Double Jeopardy Clause the State has no right to collaterally attack or direct attack the judgment of acquittal.
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.578,180.981,"Well, but the State, there's simply no proceeding available."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,192.381,198.498,"I think that's right, because of the Double Jeopardy Clause there is no right to appeal a jury's finding, or a jury verdict of acquittal."
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,210.443,218.73,"Well, of course, it's not just a judgment... you're saying that a judgment of acquittal is the same thing as a sentencing determination."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,218.73,230.057,"Well, for purposes of the distinction between an appellate court's finding and a jury verdict, the distinction that the Court was referring to in Burks, the question is, should those two be treated differently?"
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.721,236.753,"I hope you will, yes."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,236.753,245.609,"--I suspect, but for purposes of the distinction between a trial acquittal and an appellate acquittal, Burk suggests that there's no rational reason why there should be a difference."
1997.97-6146,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.353,271.244,"Well now, historically I guess we have not thought that sentencing aspects are covered by the Double Jeopardy Clause for most crimes, have we?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,271.244,272.195,That's correct.
1997.97-6146,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.195,292.309,"And if there were a judge imposing a sentence in a case and imposes it and then the defendant who is sentenced appeals on the ground that the judge imposed a sentence not authorized by law and prevails, then I suppose it would be remanded for resentencing."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,292.309,293.768,"Yes, it... I agree."
1997.97-6146,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.768,295.341,You wouldn't be arguing double jeopardy here.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,295.341,296.89,"I certainly wouldn't, or certainly not here."
1997.97-6146,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.755,306.076,Right.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,306.076,308.149,That's not what this case is all about.
1997.97-6146,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.149,316.344,But you say that this is different because of the special procedures that California employs in the context of this sentencing.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,316.344,316.725,Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.364,331.177,California was foolish to provide those protections.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,348.888,352.24,"--Well, I don't agree with the predicate that California was foolish for doing it."
1997.97-6146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.325,371.173,"But your argument is so counterintuitive, that the more protection the State gives to the defendant the worse shape the State is in as far as being able to resentence if it's overturned on appeal."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,382.2,385.342,I don't view it as punishing the State.
1997.97-6146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.758,391.907,I didn't think of that.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,394.38,395.971,--Then I'm sorry I suggested it.
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.282,414.013,"But are you accepting... you are accepting that California, unlike the death situation where there has to be a procedure to present the mitigators and the aggravators and... that for this kind of sentencing it isn't required to have a trial-type hearing at all?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,414.013,414.644,Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.644,415.936,You're conceding that?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,415.936,419.238,"Well, certainly perhaps 3 weeks ago I could have made a different argument."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.449,453.099,But why is the State locked into two models?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,470.872,471.893,"--No, and I--"
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.893,475.875,"Either give him no hearing, or give him the full-dress hearing with the double jeopardy?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,475.875,476.744,--I didn't mean to suggest that.
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,499.13,513.59,"But this isn't exactly one or the other, is it, because although you said in a conclusory way a moment ago that this, in fact, is the choice of the trial model, there are at least two respects in which it's different from the usual trial model and different from what was involved in Bullington."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,543.37,547.961,"I don think so, and let me, if I can, take them one at a time."
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,559.27,562.342,And in fact I... perhaps I didn't speak properly on that.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,572.838,591.02,"--Well, with respect to all sentence enhancement allegations in California, whether it's a current conduct enhancement such as firearm use or great bodily injury, or a strikes allegation, there's a right to a jury, and the jury, or the judge if a jury is waived, is the fact-finder for purposes of making the determination as to whether the State has presented in... sufficient evidence."
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,591.02,598.896,"But isn't... even beyond sufficiency of evidence, isn't there also a discretionary element somewhere?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,598.896,608.721,"After the fact-finding stage, where the jury or the judge, if a jury is waived, makes the determination that yes, the firearm use has been proved, or yes, the strike allegation has been proved."
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,616.148,616.328,Okay.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,620.28,621.341,"Well, actually--"
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,621.341,621.962,Normal trial scheme.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,621.962,627.275,"--Actually, under California law it isn't, judge... I'm sorry, Your Honor... because--"
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,627.275,629.807,"Don't worry, I don't regard it an insult."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,631.927,639.653,--It isn't because what we see in trials on substantive offenses in California is that very same power under section 1385.
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,647.74,654.633,"You mean, if someone is charged with armed robbery and the case is proved and so on the judge can say, well, I think in the interest of justice this should be dismissed?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,654.633,660.369,"The judge, under California law, can dismiss any allegation in the interests of justice."
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.369,660.669,Really.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,660.669,661.999,So in that sense--
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.999,663.441,"Okay, so we're back to my original two."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,668.816,668.996,--Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.628,671.838,--Okay.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,685.229,686.208,Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,727.087,728.429,"Okay, so in fact you're--"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,750.414,765.915,"I think as a... as a matter of the facts of Bullington, it turned out that they were the same, the jury's sentence, both on... the factual determination and the sentence was the same, but I think that the critical component, if I had to break them out, would be the binary determination of fact that was made, and that's made here."
1997.97-6146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,766.416,767.047,--May I... excuse me.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,778.844,799.037,"--If Almendarez-Torres had been decided differently, or perhaps not been here, I probably would have placed a greater significance on the fact that... the additional exposure to punishment that a client faces under a three strikes or a firearms allegation is so high that that in itself should--"
1997.97-6146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.037,802.99,And it cannot be imposed unless this critical finding is made by the fact-finder.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,802.99,804.441,"--Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
1997.97-6146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.441,818.23,"Mr. Gardner, even though Almendarez-Torres has been decided, isn't it possible... all that said is that recidiv... it doesn't say that recidivism laws must be nonelements."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,852.503,855.925,"I agree, and that's precisely the argument I'm trying to make."
1997.97-6146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.925,867.131,"Well, I don't think you made the argument... no, you've never come out and confronted the State and said, even though they say it's an enhancement, it's not an enhancement, it's actually an element."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,867.131,870.223,"Then let me state it now, if I haven't before."
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.707,891.378,"Now, what's your authority for those three propositions?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,891.378,894.971,"The hallmarks of trial, of course, stems from Bullington."
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.971,896.01,Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,896.01,902.204,The exposure to... the fact that exposes to additional punishment really stems from some of the due process cases this Court has now--
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.204,905.055,"So you're not relying on any one case, then?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,905.055,905.446,--No.
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.749,941.039,"Well, but what do you do with a due process case like North Carolina v. Pearce?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,941.039,947.625,"Well, I don't think Pearce... Pearce--"
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.625,952.026,Pearce says you can get a tougher sentence on resentencing.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,952.026,952.436,--Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.736,966.238,"Well, that's not the only difference."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,980.947,982.98,"Well, that, too--"
1997.97-6146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.98,990.263,"That's crucial, that if you're going to say, even though this looks like an enhancement, it smells like an enhancement, it's not an enhancement."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,999.229,1002.083,"--Well, I agree, it is crucial, and that's why the first part--"
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1002.083,1002.241,Wait a minute.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1029.753,1030.073,--No.
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.073,1030.603,Why not?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1030.603,1036.117,"Because although the Sentencing Guidelines are a way to increase punishment, it increases it within a previously prescribed range."
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1040.751,1052.128,"Oh, so if, in fact, this book had been enacted by Congress rather than delegating the power to the agency, i.e., the commission, then in your view the Double Jeopardy Clause would apply?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1052.128,1053.768,--No.
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1054.338,1055.37,Then I don't understand.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1055.37,1057.18,"--If I expressed that view, then again I misspoke."
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1057.18,1058.872,I don't think you did.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1060.864,1062.255,"No, I think the difference is this."
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.822,1083.549,"It says in the statute... it says in the statute, say, zero to 20 years, and within that, these are factors, and you're saying it's the zero to 20 years that makes the difference."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1083.549,1084.721,--That's part of the difference.
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1084.721,1084.921,Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1084.921,1085.912,That's part of the difference.
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.912,1086.142,What else?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1086.142,1086.623,That's the first part.
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1093.787,1096.732,"Well, that has never been decided, I mean, I think in this Court."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1125.389,1125.91,Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1125.91,1126.24,All right.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1141.371,1153.869,"Well, the difference isn't between a statute and a regulation, and I'm not suggesting for a moment that the California system of what we call determinate sentencing level, where the judge chooses from 2, 3, or 4 years, where choice is within that previously prescribed range, are subject to double jeopardy."
1997.97-6146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.349,1168.559,Can you tell me--
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1181.836,1185.61,"Actually, I'd rather not express an opinion on that."
1997.97-6146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1188.832,1191.176,"You don't think that's relevant to this case, do you?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1191.176,1194.717,That's certainly not an issue in this case.
1997.97-6146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1194.717,1196.049,May I ask you this.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1222.037,1226.852,"Well, double jeopardy typically would not apply to sentences."
1997.97-6146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1235.938,1236.138,"No, no."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1243.134,1246.035,"--You can't do that under California law, Your Honor."
1997.97-6146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1246.035,1249.026,But I'm assuming that you have some State procedure where this happens.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1267.71,1271.752,"Certainly, I think that there's a component of finality in the Double Jeopardy Clause."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1290.965,1298.301,"Mr. Gardner, it would help me to put a little flesh on these bones and to tell us exactly what was the proof deficiency here."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1304.475,1305.457,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.457,1308.178,"To a crime called what, assault with a deadly weapon?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1308.178,1326.8,"It was a guilty plea to assault and the proof deficiency requires a brief understanding of the particular allegation at issue here, and that is, in defendant's current offense he was charged with having committed the prior assault, but that does not expose one, under the California scheme, to additional punishment."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1337.317,1343.852,Wasn't that charged as part of the indictment in that prior crime?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1343.852,1345.301,In the original assault?
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1345.301,1345.762,Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1345.762,1353.368,"It was not either charged or established from the records of the prior conviction, and that was the proof deficiency in this case, to just--"
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1353.368,1358.832,What would it have taken to supply the deficiency?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1369.647,1369.848,--The--
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.848,1370.348,--Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1370.348,1379.034,"--The prosecutor slipped here because what the prosecutor introduced was a four-page document that did, indeed, show that the defendant was convicted of assault in 1992."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.479,1389.292,"And where would that document, documentation have come from?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1389.292,1403.421,"Now, under California law the State has a limited universe of places to provide that information, or to seek that information, called the record of conviction, so the State would have had to look in the record of conviction to see if there was documentation to establish that in the 1992 assault--"
1997.97-6146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1403.421,1407.034,"What's in the record of conviction, the transcript of the evidence?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1407.034,1407.585,--Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.375,1411.736,Which this was.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1422.522,1429.808,"--Well, if the pieces of paper that Your Honor is referring to were admissible and if, indeed, they contained the information that was necessary to cure the insufficiency--"
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1429.808,1434.162,"Were they records of the very court that we were dealing with, or was there some other court?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1434.162,1443.048,"--If the question is, was the 1992 assault conviction from the same superior court in the current case, I don't know the answer."
1997.97-6146,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.155,1459.307,"Well, it can't be easily proven if there's a presumption of innocence that applies."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1463.391,1465.833,"--Ultimately, that's the evidentiary failure in this case."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1465.833,1472.028,"But you're saying there was proof of a prior assault, that there was proof of that."
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1472.028,1476.732,"The question as to whether defendant committed a 1992 assault was, indeed, established by the State."
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.866,1485.808,What about the fact that the lawyer didn't contest it?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1503.921,1504.371,--Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1504.371,1507.212,And then there is no objection on the ground of personal use.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1518.121,1519.193,"Okay, for two reasons."
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1519.193,1519.393,Yes.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1519.393,1525.488,"First, the fact that there's no objection does not in any way undercut the State's burden to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1541.19,1543.521,But it was... it was a single defendant case.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1545.524,1548.105,"--That part was never established, Your Honor, at this trial, absolutely not."
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1556.071,1562.455,"But what was introduced into evidence, the issue is whether there was an assault with a deadly weapon, is that right?"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1562.455,1565.117,The issue is whether defendant personally used a weapon during the assault.
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1565.117,1565.358,Personally used a weapon.
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1582.762,1585.063,"Well, if we had those two things--"
1997.97-6146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1585.063,1585.533,"Now, you have those three things--"
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1585.533,1591.466,"--I will answer that question, but we don't have those things, because at the first hearing the State introduced no evidence that a stick was used."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.936,1637.159,--But... so what exactly was presented?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1651.39,1653.39,"Yes, that's not so."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1660.035,1661.484,Does it take four pages to say--
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1661.484,1664.187,"--Well, it's a prison package, and it comes from the prison."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1678.179,1682.7,--And there would be no description of the crime beyond assault?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1682.7,1697.709,"Beyond, in this case, Penal Code section 245(a)(1), I believe was the provision, which, of course, is not sufficient in and of itself and that's why we have this finding by the State court of appeal, that was agreed to by the Attorney General and has never been contested, of insufficient evidence."
1997.97-6146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1703.804,1709.849,And there was an objection to that evidence being insufficient at the sentencing?
1997.97-6146,0,18968,clifford_gardner,,1709.849,1721.188,"--There was no argument on insufficiency of the evidence, but under State law that is not necessary to raise insufficiency of the evidence on appeal, which was done, and the court of appeals said, you know, by gosh, you're right, there was insufficient evidence."
1997.97-6146,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.208,1755.5,"Thank you, Mr. Gardner."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1760.493,1767.759,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-6146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1793.023,1800.37,"Would you agree, then, that it would be a limitation, based on the rule as we would understand it, if we go back to Bullington?"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1800.37,1806.595,"--Your Honor, it's our position that Bullington is self-limiting, that Bullington does not purport to--"
1997.97-6146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1806.595,1820.862,"Well, I don't see how you can say that in the light of DiFrancesco, because DiFrancesco wasn't a capital, and if it had been the capital versus noncapital character, DiFrancesco would have been distinguished right then and there."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1834.974,1849.394,"--Well, Your Honor, I think more recently, specifically in Caspari v. Bohlen, the Court has described Bullington as arising and based largely on the rationale that applies in the death penalty context."
1997.97-6146,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.394,1854.556,Your position is that it was Bullington that was a departure from the line of cases like Stroud.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1854.556,1864.863,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, because it is our position that the ultimate inquiry in the double jeopardy context is whether a criminal offense is being adjudicated."
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.965,1870.607,"May I ask one question, Mr. Glassman?"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1882.507,1899.348,"Well, Justice Stevens, the Court has allowed for enhancements that share elements of the... or aspects, I should say, of the underlying crime, so... I don't know if that answered the question, but our argument generally--"
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.348,1902.059,"It seems to me you could answer the argument yes or no, and I'm not quite--"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1902.059,1902.269,--Yes.
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1902.269,1904.231,--I want to be sure I get what your answer is.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1904.231,1906.553,Our argument is that... is yes.
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.553,1907.495,That's what I thought.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1907.495,1911.097,"That, for example, use of a weapon is a typical element of a sentence enhancement."
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.097,1919.603,"Now, you don't rely on the fact that it... this might be characterized as a recidivism case, as distinct... as... with any special weight in your argument."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1919.603,1930.108,"Well, it's given weight, in our view, insofar as the Court has generally decided that recidivism statutes do not present a double jeopardy concern."
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.108,1939.685,"Right, but if you relied just on that, and we only decided that, then it would leave open the question whether your statute would be valid as applied to use of a firearm, for instance."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1939.685,1949.71,"And that is why, Your Honor, our position ultimately is that the crucial concern is the guilt or innocence determination, but that is the concern... that is the idea--"
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.71,1950.621,"Right, and the--"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1950.621,1951.603,--of the Double Jeopardy Clause that's described by--
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.603,1963.832,"--And the question that's missing here is he was not proven to be guilty of precisely what needed to enhance, and in another example he might not have been proven guilty of using a firearm, if you call it an element of the offense rather than an enhancement."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,1963.832,1979.051,"--Well, there is disagreement, I think, in terms of the nature of this... of exactly what happened in this case, and perhaps... and this relates back to Justice Ginsburg's question, Justice Stevens, but if I could describe my view of how this originated in the first place, although--"
1997.97-6146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.051,1985.203,"Yes, before you get back into the facts... I would like to hear your view of it, but it seems to me you've overstated what we've held."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2038.24,2044.491,"--Well, actually, Your Honor, it's our position that this is a traditional recidivism statute."
1997.97-6146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.891,2104.121,"But you wouldn't deny, would you, that if, in fact, the existence of the three pre-existing felonies, if the fact that they exist of a certain sort or not, if each of those were an element of the offense, then I take it you would not deny the applicability of the Double Jeopardy Clause."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2124.244,2127.288,I believe the answer would be yes.
1997.97-6146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2127.288,2127.395,All right.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2139.343,2160.858,"Your Honor, my understanding of the petitioner's argument is that the double jeopardy determination is based solely on whether or not the proceeding which has been labeled a sentencing proceeding and which we, of course, consider a sentencing proceeding, is, in fact, so akin to a trial on guilt or innocence in terms of its structure--"
1997.97-6146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.858,2163.25,"I know he's... I know what he's arguing, and I asked him if he--"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2165.87,2166.451,--That is not the argument.
1997.97-6146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.993,2179.681,"I asked you, has it ever been argued that these three things, the three extra felonies of a certain kind, their existence, that the need to have them is an element of the offense?"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2179.681,2182.363,--I cannot recall a case that involves that particular--
1997.97-6146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.363,2184.524,I'm asking if in this case--
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2184.524,2184.754,--No.
1997.97-6146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.016,2186.236,--It was not argued.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2186.415,2187.176,The answer is no.
1997.97-6146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2187.176,2195.09,And now you were going to tell us what this deficiency in the evidence was and how that deficiency could have been supplied.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2195.09,2212.981,"Your Honor, in this case the trial judge was reviewing... or the sentencing judge, I should say, was reviewing a series of documents, and the judge, in view of the appellate court in California, was not entirely precise as to the basis of the judge's determination of the prior conviction."
1997.97-6146,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.444,2266.117,The court file that you refer to is something different than what Mr. Gardner referred to as the four-page thing?
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2266.117,2266.858,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2276.244,2280.706,Are you arguing that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the trial judge's sentence?
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2280.706,2285.101,"Your Honor, I'm aware that the State courts have found that the evidence is insufficient."
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.453,2288.323,"But you're not asking us to review that, are you?"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2288.323,2293.327,"--No, but this Court has in effect reevaluated those kinds of determinations in--"
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.327,2300.391,"By State courts, by... we second-guess the State court on its application of its own law to the facts in the record here?"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2300.391,2314.101,"--No, Your Honor, but I think, for example, Lockhart v. Nelson indicates that the Court evaluates the nature of the finding that was made to determine whether it's properly characterized, for example, as insufficient evidence or trial error."
1997.97-6146,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.538,2457.979,Mr.--
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2457.979,2459.551,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-6146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2459.551,2462.912,--I think Justice Souter wanted to ask you--
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2495.395,2516.358,"The distinction that we would draw, though, Justice Souter, is that in Bullington the Court attaches significance to the fact that the only choice in the sentence is the choice made by that trier of fact, and in this case that is... it is true that is the only choice the jury makes, but that is not the choice that ultimately or definitively decides the sentence."
1997.97-6146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2517.45,2529.067,"Well, do you take the position that in California, for example, Bullington wouldn't apply because the sentencer can always say, well, for reasons of justice I'm not going to apply this?"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2529.067,2540.686,"--Of course not, Your Honor, but that's because I'm not merely describing a process in California in which the judge as... decides to accept or reject the verdict, or the decision of the jury."
1997.97-6146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2565.081,2566.371,"Well, you're certainly right there."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2592.98,2610.462,"--I think... I guess that I would disagree, Your Honor, because it seems to me that the trial on the offense concern remains paramount in the double jeopardy context, but with respect to your question--"
1997.97-6146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2610.462,2617.385,So there's just... then you're saying there's just... there's always a categorical distinction between offense and sentence except in the capital area.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2617.385,2619.986,"--I believe that's the lesson of Bullington, Your Honor."
1997.97-6146,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2641.754,2641.914,Mm-hmm.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2641.914,2666.25,"And the sentencing discretion that is required, or certainly more important in the capital phase, is not at issue in this case, and that is why, in our view, when Justice Blackmun's majority opinion in Bullington described a hallmarks penalty trial as unique, he was referring to the uniqueness of the context of that case."
1997.97-6146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.25,2669.853,We even... our terminology even suggests that.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2684.983,2720.176,"Yes, Your Honor, and the Court does not, and I don't think... I don't understand analytically how one could be acquitted of a sentence and that is, of course, the petitioner's argument, that this is somehow an acquittal, as though, if he is correct, the State would be foreclosed from alleging a future recidivism action, for example, or that in the context of a death penalty case, if the sole aggravator was another criminal offense, the acquittal, or the decision of life, would constitute an acquittal of that future crime."
1997.97-6146,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.478,2756.043,"But Teague doesn't apply to a case coming from a State court, Mr. Glassman."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2756.043,2776.215,"Your honor, I'm not suggesting that the Teague analysis controls the case or is determinative, but my point is simply that when the Court said in Teague that, in terms of whether or not double jeopardy applied to noncapital sentencing, Justice O'Connor's majority opinion clearly says that the Court's prior precedents had gone in exactly the opposite direction."
1997.97-6146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.965,2824.968,"Although they may elevate it to being an element of the crime, in which event they would elevate it to all the other things."
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2824.968,2826.09,"Your Honor, I don't--"
1997.97-6146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.09,2828.371,Although the point's been made that that argument was not presented.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2828.371,2835.998,"--And I don't believe that their argument... in other words, that the presence of these hallmarks is directed at the element issue."
1997.97-6146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.11,2839.08,But why can't I answer the question that way?
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2861.098,2887.605,"--It's a fair way to answer it, perhaps, but again, my reading of cases such as McMillan v. Pennsylvania indicate that it is not the shared elements test that is determinative, and that in our context, in the double jeopardy analysis--"
1997.97-6146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.605,2890.988,"Why is it a fair element if it's not in the case, elements of the offense?"
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2896.051,2898.682,"--May I answer the question, Your Honor?"
1997.97-6146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2898.682,2899.233,Yes.
1997.97-6146,1,20904,david_f_glassman,,2899.233,2902.675,Double jeopardy in my view speaks to guilt only.
1997.97-6146,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2904.466,2906.579,"Thank you, Mr. Glassman."
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2908.161,2917.608,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-6146,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.402,2956.384,"Well, it can be."
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2963.148,2966.661,"--That they're uniquely severe, and invariably as great as--"
1997.97-6146,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.661,2967.472,Invariably.
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2978.24,2982.563,--It still is not a choice between life and death.
1997.97-6146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3020.069,3022.52,If it did apply... I'm not certain of the answer to this.
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3038.442,3052.109,"We would contend not, although there might be an argument that under the collateral estoppel line of double jeopardy that we would... that the State would be bound in future--"
1997.97-6146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.109,3054.352,"They are anyway, aren't they, under collateral estoppel, or not?"
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3068.742,3084.921,"--They wouldn't be bound necessarily, because there would be a question of whether this determination in the sentencing context has all the... you mean not as a constitutional matter?"
1997.97-6146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3084.921,3096.059,"No, I mean... you know, I mean, what happens if, in fact, they have another trial, another punishment, another sentencing phase on a different matter, and it turns out that there's a factual issue that's identical, the very same fact?"
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3096.059,3097.249,That would be a rule of State--
1997.97-6146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3097.249,3099.46,"Yes, but don't all the States... do they, or not?"
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3100.061,3110.91,"--I think that it's the case with sentencing determinations like this, and recidivist determinations, that it's a new... that the State has a new chance to establish that true finding."
1997.97-6146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3115.251,3131.603,"The State loses the first time in the sentencing proceeding, where the issue is what happened on the night of July 5, 1988, at 6:00 in the morning, did he have a gun or not, and then he commits another crime, and in sentencing it becomes relevant again, and the State isn't bound, they can bring it up again, try and get him again?"
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3131.603,3147.643,"My understanding, from what the California supreme court stated to be the rule, is that that's... that the case with recidivist findings is that the findings may be alleged again in future proceedings."
1997.97-6146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.643,3149.435,Do you think there's a Due Process Clause issue there?
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3149.435,3160.662,"There certainly might be limitations under the Due Process Clause on what would be permissible, but that... you know, obviously that's not the question here."
1997.97-6146,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3161.233,3196.516,"Well, DiFrancesco talked about an expectation of finality, and pointed out that there the defendant knew that there was a proceeding where the sentence could be appealed and that there might be more hearings, but if you have a procedure in which the sentence is final, the appellate court affirms the sentence, and then there's some proceeding, new proceeding to reopen it, it seems to me that that does maybe indicate that an expectation of finality is being disappointed."
1997.97-6146,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3198.018,3209.965,"--Correct, it's not this case, Justice Kennedy, and we would submit that the expectation of finality that's created only goes so far as the State law that creates it."
1997.97-6146,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3295.491,3296.983,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
