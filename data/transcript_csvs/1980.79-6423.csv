1980.79-6423,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,We'll hear arguments next in Lassiter v. the Department of Social Services.
1980.79-6423,0,34383,leowen_evans,,65.208,74.298,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.754,199.629,"Has this Court ever gone, counsel, ever gone beyond the criminal proceedings in requiring states to appoint counsel in particular proceedings?"
1980.79-6423,0,34383,leowen_evans,,199.629,205.099,"No, Mr. Justice, not a purely civil proceeding."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,1712.856,1717.408,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1843.189,1847.907,This statute quite definitely does not apply in that proceeding?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,1847.907,1851.676,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1963.813,1965.546,This was testimony at the hearing?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,1965.546,1966.532,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.532,1967.582,Without a lawyer?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,1967.582,1969.717,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1981.492,1983.727,Did he have a right to do that?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,1983.727,1984.56,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1985.294,1989.746,"Well, was anybody there to contest whether he had that right?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,1989.746,1991.781,--He has the right under North Carolina law.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1991.781,1997.102,"Well, I mean... what did the... could a lawyer contest that?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,1997.102,2002.054,He could have contested it but it would have been a fruitless contest under North Carolina law.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.054,2005.206,"Well, then it's your point it wouldn't do them any good to have had a lawyer anyhow."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2007.307,2025.002,"Well, I'm not going to stand here and argue the ineffectiveness of lawyers, but I'm saying that the statutory scheme on balance would make their effectiveness in this kind of proceeding minimal, as compared to the state's interest in not requiring by statute that they be appointed."
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2025.002,2038.66,"Well, Mr. Odom, do I understand that presently, under your present law, there could not be a termination proceeding until there had first been a custody proceeding at which the custody was turned over to a state agency?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2038.66,2042.797,The Department of Social Services cannot initiate--
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2042.797,2044.18,"Well, that's what I'm talking about."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2044.18,2047.015,--Until they had in fact been given custody by a court's--
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2047.015,2047.515,All right.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2053.085,2054.019,"--That is correct, yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2054.019,2058.806,"And, at least she'd have had counsel there?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2058.806,2060.691,"Yes, that is correct."
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2060.691,2067.912,"And she might have prevailed against the award of custody to the state agency, which would have meant there would never be a termination proceeding."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2068.745,2069.281,That is correct.
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2069.281,2071.331,At least one initiated by the state agency.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2072.233,2072.733,That is correct.
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2072.733,2077.118,"Well, then, there is some connection between this new statute and this case, isn't there?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2077.118,2098.883,"Many judges tend to... if in fact, this case arose after the effective date of that statute in January of 1980, the court will continue the appointment of counsel so that if in fact the child is removed at a hearing at which the parent was represented, that the parent will have the benefit of continued--"
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2098.883,2100.533,Later in the termination proceeding?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2100.533,2102.352,--If in fact it comes up in a termination court--
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2102.352,2107.054,"Then, I do suggest there's some relevance of this new statute to this case."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2107.054,2113.976,"--It can be construed in that fashion subsequent to the effective date, but of course this all started before then."
1980.79-6423,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.976,2117.262,"Well, wouldn't the child have a right to counsel too?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2117.262,2119.714,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what happened--"
1980.79-6423,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2119.714,2121.33,"Under the new statute, that's correct?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2122.666,2126.468,"--He did under the old statute, and I'll explain why."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2166.778,2171.662,But in this case there was testimony that the grandmother wanted the child?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2171.662,2182.704,"But there was conflicting testimony, Mr. Justice Marshall, to the effect that the grandmother had in fact told the case worker in discussions about that, that she couldn't take care of the child."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2185.739,2198.98,"Well, one thing, as I understand it, is North Carolina says you need two counsel, one for the child and one for the parent in a temporary procedure."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2201.499,2203.701,--That is correct.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.152,2212.806,What else do I need to rule against you than that?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2212.806,2229.749,"--I think if you could understand what actually happened in practice, you could see why the interest of the state in not doing it is substantial enough to not require it, especially as a matter of constitutional law."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.605,2238.272,"Well, what can I do generally?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2244.076,2254.549,"--Well, also in this record, Mr. Justice Marshall, is the uncontroverted fact that the woman made no effort to see the child after he was removed and--"
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.549,2259.87,"And it's also in this record, uncontroverted, that she didn't have counsel who could have told her that."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2259.87,2272.844,"--When a parent's child, when this woman's child was removed from her, had she... she didn't even appear at the custody hearing which took the child away from her."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.046,2278.265,"What do you mean, uncontroverted?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2278.265,2280.115,It's uncontested.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.115,2282.534,"Well, how can she contest without a lawyer?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2282.534,2289.472,The point I'm making is that it is understood by everyone that she was given notice of the original hearing.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2289.472,2294.024,"Well, it's not to me, unless you show it to me in the record."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2294.024,2296.126,All right.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.582,2316.604,"Well, on page 16 of that same record, Appendix, Narrative of Testimony,"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2337.148,2338.434,--I'm not sure under North Carolina--
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.434,2339.45,Is that correct?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2339.45,2340.886,"--That's what it says; yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2340.886,2343.219,It has your signature on it.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2346.79,2348.406,"Yes, sir, that was the comment--"
1980.79-6423,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2348.406,2350.625,Not at the hearing that's in the transcript.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2350.625,2351.308,--In question now.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.308,2356.146,"Well, then you say, at the first hearing she waived this future hearing?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2356.146,2362.966,"She waived her right to appear at that hearing and contest the removal of the child from her, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2362.966,2365.002,"Well, it says here she asked for help."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2365.002,2366.685,In this proceeding.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.309,2379.511,"Did she... could you read what, hear what I said."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2383.213,2384.263,But she didn't ask the court--
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.263,2387.081,"Well, she wasn't anyplace else but in jail."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2388.45,2389.983,--She was brought to the hearing.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.983,2391.069,This doesn't say it here.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2391.069,2391.769,"Yes, it does."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2392.652,2396.871,Where does it say she was brought to the hearing on that paragraph?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2403.793,2414.684,"But it says that she stated to the Court... and she had to be present to the Court to state it... she was in fact brought to the hearing, but she didn't ask--"
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.684,2415.267,This says that--
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2415.267,2418.302,--She did not ask for an appointed counsel.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.119,2420.688,"--Now, this woman was in jail?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2420.688,2423.404,--She was but she was brought to the hearing.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.404,2425.09,"Well, was she in custody?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2425.09,2426.323,"When she was brought to the hearing, yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.323,2427.575,Was she ever out of custody?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2427.575,2429.444,She has not been out of custody since--
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.444,2433.246,"Well, how could she get a lawyer while she was in custody?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2433.246,2434.679,--She had a lawyer.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.679,2435.948,For her criminal affair.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2435.948,2438.383,But she never bothered to mention to it to him.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2446.87,2450.107,Is this a lawyer of her own choice or an appointed lawyer?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2450.107,2451.84,"--It's retained counsel, Your Honor."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2451.84,2452.657,Yes.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2459.146,2459.946,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.946,2463.415,"Well, where do I find that?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2463.415,2472.354,It's inconceivable that she could not have at least mentioned the proceeding to him.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.554,2477.341,"To me it's unimportant whether she mentioned to ""Ab-ab""."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2490.565,2491.248,--She could write.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.584,2496.469,"Well, how could she get a lawyer by writing?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2496.469,2499.521,She obtained one through her mother who--
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.521,2502.89,"Well, where is he in this case?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2506.675,2514.698,"--But she was communicating with him, and the big issue was that she had... and the point to be made from this is that if she in fact were so concerned--"
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.698,2518.733,Did you at the hearing ask her why she didn't say it?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2518.733,2521.018,"--No, sir, I never did."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2521.018,2521.985,That's your answer.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2526.589,2531.874,But she did say that she had never mentioned this proceeding to him but had been communicating with him throughout.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2531.874,2534.192,She needed counsel.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2535.444,2536.577,"No, sir, I don't think so."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.577,2539.695,"She... well, who was protecting her rights?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2550.818,2553.77,"No, sir, and we would not purport to even argue that."
1980.79-6423,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.77,2560.792,"Well, I know, but suppose the state did, would it be unconstitutional to keep her retained counsel out of the hearing?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2560.792,2561.442,Yes.
1980.79-6423,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.842,2562.492,Why?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2563.727,2573.933,--I'm not arguing that counsel would not have been effective in perhaps presenting testimony to the court.
1980.79-6423,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.558,2595.597,"Well, following up your answer to Mr. Justice White's question, why couldn't the state say that neither retained nor appointed counsel shall represent anybody in these proceedings?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2615.077,2631.789,"It's possible, I suppose, that the Legislature could do that, but I think it would fly in the face of an inherent presumption that in any kind of legal action that was in fact brought in a court of law, a person is entitled to appear by retained counsel."
1980.79-6423,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2632.122,2637.257,"Well, that's a presumption fostered by the legal profession, but that doesn't make it constitutional."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2637.257,2643.41,"--Well, I think it would be one that would be given a great deal of attention."
1980.79-6423,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2643.41,2647.714,"Well, it certainly would because most judges are lawyers."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2647.714,2673.382,"What would happen, I think, what would happen, the Legislature could do, in North Carolina, it could create an administrative body to make a determination as to whether or not the Department can make a decision as to whether the woman's rights to the child would be totally and permanently severed."
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2695.362,2705.301,"Mr. Odom, I just want to be clear."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2714.657,2715.174,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2715.174,2732.885,"If that results in the transfer of custody to a state agency, which then initiates a proceeding to terminate the parental relationship, then counsel as a matter of practice, even though the statute doesn't require it, is provided at the termination hearing also?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2732.885,2739.891,I think as a practical matter the court tends to extend the appointment of counsel--
1980.79-6423,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2739.891,2744.093,Does the court... is the practice in fact to do it?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2744.093,2748.913,--My experience has been that some judges do and some judges don't.
1980.79-6423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.799,2754.901,Thank you.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2765.589,2766.458,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2766.458,2771.176,"Mr. Odom, let me follow through on one factual thing that disturbs me."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2786.003,2786.872,"Yes, it does."
1980.79-6423,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2786.872,2787.988,And what does it show?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2787.988,2804.481,"It shows that she contacted the mother and discussed with her the idea of perhaps giving the child up for adoption or terminating her rights or asking her what she wanted to do with the child, and all she said was, I want the child to live with my mother."
1980.79-6423,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2819.859,2821.443,On several occasions?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2821.443,2825.33,"That's what the transcript says; yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.33,2832.401,At least two times you said that she saw... only two times in the year she saw her son?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2834.186,2836.219,"No, sir, that was prior to her going to jail."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2836.219,2843.123,"Well, I was reading the transcript and I have great difficulty with it."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2847.825,2849.577,I thought you had asked me a question.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2849.577,2851.912,"Yes, that's the question I asked you."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2854.864,2857.732,Immediately preceding.
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2870.706,2873.142,But the record says she was in jail.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2878.879,2887.152,"What the transcript shows is that she hadn't seen him at all since he had been removed, but two or three times, those occurring when, in fact, she was out on the street."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.152,2891.52,"Well, I'll take a look at it and give you the benefit of the doubt."
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2891.52,2906.713,"In fact, though, the petition was brought on two grounds and the court concluded as a matter of law that she had failed to maintain concern or responsibility as to the child's welfare."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.533,2965.485,"Mr. Odom, you personally, as... what?"
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2966.835,2967.601,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.601,2970.703,--was assigned to this case and you were there from the beginning to the end?
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2970.703,2971.237,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.237,2973.505,Thank you.
1980.79-6423,1,43158,thomas_russell_odom,,2973.505,2979.809,Thank you.
1980.79-6423,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2979.809,2982.595,Mr. Shaber.
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,2982.595,2994.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6423,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3052.255,3055.021,Has there been any effort to have the Legislature address it?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3059.509,3064.746,"Your Honor, I can suggest a couple of possible distinctions."
1980.79-6423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.925,3136.609,May I just interrupt?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3139.461,3149.149,"By the time the termination hearing comes along, Justice Stevens, the County Department of Social Services has made a decision that the child cannot go home and should not go home."
1980.79-6423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.476,3171.882,"It's kind of ironic, because at the first hearing it has a greater interest in the parent's side of the potential controversy and yet the parent has an independent right to counsel."
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3178.919,3202.165,"--Yes, sir, Your Honor, I concede the irony in that, and I would nevertheless suggest that the reason is that by the time you get to the termination action, the state's interest is really not readily distinguishable from the interest of any other private person who under the termination statute might also have had standing to bring a termination of parental rights action."
1980.79-6423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3215.175,3220.746,But there are very few civil situations in which a state sues indigent litigants.
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3220.746,3224.864,"--Your Honor, proportionately, yes, but in fact I think it's not uncommon."
1980.79-6423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.583,3232.969,"By hypothesis, somebody who owns a lot of real estate normally is not indigent."
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3232.969,3245.027,"--Your Honor, I do a lot of food stamp law and AFDC law, and I find a lot of people with a small parcel of property who have nothing else, and their prospect would be, mortgage the property."
1980.79-6423,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3263.254,3271.76,"Well, I take it, anyway, Mr. Shaber, your Legislature has never expressly addressed the question, why not also counsel at the termination hearing?"
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3271.76,3280.2,"Your Honor, Mr. Odom includes in the appendix to his brief two bills which did go before the General Assembly but which did not pass."
1980.79-6423,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3280.2,3280.966,I see.
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3280.966,3287.77,I ought to tell the Court at this juncture that I have also drafted a bill which I understand will be submitted at this session.
1980.79-6423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3294.923,3298.891,Is it also true that there are a great many more custody hearings than there are termination hearings?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3298.891,3299.577,Very many more.
1980.79-6423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.577,3302.945,So the Legislature might have been more aware of the problem there?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3302.945,3305.329,"Yes, sir, that is a possibility, but I don't know--"
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3305.329,3316.735,"And typically, as in this case, a termination proceeding takes place only after there has been a loss by the parent of custody?"
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3316.735,3317.403,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3317.403,3320.755,Although it's not necessarily so in all situations?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3320.755,3324.707,"Your Honor, I think, in all instances where the government would--"
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3324.707,3326.242,Then it is necessarily so?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3326.242,3326.808,--It is necessarily so.
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3330.027,3331.51,That was what you said in answer to my brother Brennan earlier.
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3331.51,3331.979,--Yes.
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3331.979,3337.8,But there are some situations in which there can be a termination hearing without an antecedent custody proceeding.
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3337.8,3340.033,Not when they're brought by the County--
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3340.033,3340.752,Not when they're brought--
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3340.752,3341.702,"--Yes, sir; when they're brought by private parties."
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3344.22,3347.922,--But they're very rare?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3347.922,3350.691,I would think that they're on the order of 50 or 60 a year.
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3353.06,3359.464,Right.
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3359.464,3369.67,"If I might, let me speak very briefly to the prospect that this decision might be held to be retroactive."
1980.79-6423,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3420.133,3421.968,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock.
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3450.938,3454.89,"--Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court:"
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3495.114,3496.632,His wife married somebody else?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3496.632,3497.566,"Ah, yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3497.566,3498.099,His former wife?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3498.099,3498.566,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-6423,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.47,3510.374,Did he explain to anyone how if he can't afford a lawyer he's going to support his child?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3510.374,3511.642,"--No, sir, he doesn't."
1980.79-6423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3588.889,3596.81,Do you think the American Bar Association has taken the position it does in this litigation because it's looking to the long run best interest of employment for lawyers?
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3596.81,3599.179,"--Justice Stevens, I think not."
1980.79-6423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3617.474,3630.631,"I suppose this may have an impact on the small claims courts in the states where they preclude any lawyers, along the lines of Mr. Justice Rehnquist's suggestion?"
1980.79-6423,2,42053,steven_mansfield_shaber,,3630.631,3647.91,I suggested to Justice Rehnquist that the counsel would have to be provided in those instances... perhaps not in your hypothetical... simply because this right to family integrity has been given special treatment by this Court in Stanley and the following cases.
1980.79-6423,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3651.278,3654.164,"You have about three minutes remaining, Mr. Evans."
1980.79-6423,3,34383,leowen_evans,,3654.164,3657.016,"Thank you, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-6423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3757.647,3762.801,"And yet it's not your contention that this is a criminal prosecution, is it?"
1980.79-6423,3,34383,leowen_evans,,3762.801,3763.801,"No, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-6423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3763.801,3767.855,"And that's the line that the Constitution draws, the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution."
1980.79-6423,3,34383,leowen_evans,,3767.855,3768.372,The Sixth Amendment--
1980.79-6423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3768.372,3771.891,Which guarantees counsel in all criminal prosecutions?
1980.79-6423,3,34383,leowen_evans,,3771.891,3775.609,"--The Sixth Amendment does, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-6423,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3807.061,3812.115,Is there some reference to the notion that she was not able to take care?
1980.79-6423,3,34383,leowen_evans,,3812.115,3813.798,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-6423,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3937.609,3939.478,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Evans."
1980.79-6423,3,34383,leowen_evans,,3939.478,3940.295,--Yes.
1980.79-6423,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3943.247,3944.297,"Thank you, gentlemen."
