1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,"We'll hear argument now in No. 86-6757, John Avery Coy v. Iowa."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,14.074,18.795,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,47.129,49.562,How large a town is Clinton?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,49.562,50.578,Pardon me?
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,50.578,52.428,How large the city is Clinton?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,52.428,53.344,"--Thirty-some thousand, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,53.344,53.728,How much?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,53.728,55.713,"Thirty-some thousand, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,55.713,57.496,Small town?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,57.496,60.498,Relatively small town.
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,60.498,62.134,Relatively small city.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,62.134,64.902,Yes.
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,111.198,112.817,Did they identify them?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,112.817,114.418,They never identified him--
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,114.418,117.703,In what way then was it critical?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,117.703,135.665,"--Their testimony was critical in, of course, establishing that an assault did occur and in identifying much of the circumstantial evidence that was used or attempted to be used to tie in Mr. Coy to this particular crime, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.409,183.813,What did the trial court judge instruct the jury about this device and the reason for it?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,183.813,194.37,"He gave instruction, Your Honor, after the first witness was called to the stand, and from the record it is the only reference to instruction in the record:"
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.534,232.496,"Well, I would like you to comment on whether it isn't the case that kind of instruction to the jury certainly takes away much of the thrust of what you say was the inevitable consequence of use of the device."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,232.496,234.812,"No, I think it does not, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.259,260.313,"I thought the people who were singled out were the child witnesses, not the Defendant."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,260.313,263.848,"It wasn't in fact, Your Honor, the child witnesses who were singled out."
1987.86-6757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.425,314.214,I think this problem could be eliminated if in the future the state puts the screen in front of the child witness instead of in front of the defendant.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,314.214,318.517,"That would be one means, Justice Scalia, I think, of lessening the prejudicial impact."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,330.842,336.396,"Counsel, what, if anything, shows who, if anybody, asked for this?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,336.396,355.941,"The record shows that the defense... that the county prosecutor made an application seven days prior to trial for closed-circuit television use of the child's testimony, and that while the children were out of the courtroom, the Defendant be separated from them by a screen."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,370.534,376.788,When was the Defendant told about this?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,380.175,381.958,"The county prosecutor did, yes."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,381.958,385.06,Was the Defendant advised of that?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,385.06,390.964,"Yes, the Defendant received a copy of the county attorney's motion, and there was a hearing held, at which time--"
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,390.964,392.833,Did he object or not?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,392.833,404.723,"--Yes, he objected vigorously throughout this trial on Fourth... Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, and he moved for a mistrial at all appropriate stages of the proceedings to preserve his--"
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.723,407.825,What grounds did the prosecutor give for moving?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,407.825,414.596,"--There is absolutely, Your Honor, in this record, no ground of any sort given by the prosecutor or found by the trial--"
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,414.596,418.967,"He just said what, please have closed-circuit or a screen?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,418.967,422.935,"--He said, there's a new Iowa statute, and I ask that it be used."
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.156,431.322,When what?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,431.322,431.906,Pardon me?
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.906,433.274,When what?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,433.274,436.393,When a child testifies we might use a screen of this sort.
1987.86-6757,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,449.284,453.752,Did the screen obscure the view of the Defendant by the jury?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,453.752,454.621,"No, it did not."
1987.86-6757,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,454.621,455.437,They could see him?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,455.437,456.254,"They could see him, yes."
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.254,458.139,And he could see the witnesses?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,458.139,460.841,"There is some question about how clearly, but yes, it was designed--"
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.841,465.995,At least there was no intention of obstructing his view of the witnesses.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,465.995,466.712,--That is correct.
1987.86-6757,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,472.916,476.185,Was the screen removed after they completed their testimony?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,476.185,482.772,"Yes, after the two thirteen year old girls testified and for the remainder of the trial, the screen was no longer in place."
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.772,484.207,Were they the first witnesses?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,484.207,486.326,First two witnesses for the state.
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.326,496.281,"Mr. Papak, if express findings had been made by the trial court judge that it was necessary and appropriate in this case, would you be here?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,496.281,498.133,"Yes, we would still be here, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,498.133,501.668,"So that's irrelevant, really, to your argument."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,501.668,502.352,"No, it's not--"
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.352,508.406,"You spend a lot of time talking about the need for findings, but I'm not clear that that would solve it in your view."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,508.406,523.349,"--No, it would not solve it in this particular instance, Your Honor, and I maintain that it would not because the requirement before the state may infringe on fundamental rights of a criminal defendant is not only a showing of necessity, but a careful tailoring of the infringement."
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.806,538.591,"Well, here the findings were in effect made by the state legislature, weren't they?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,538.591,539.71,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.618,583.656,What difference does it make if it's glaring or not?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,583.656,587.458,"I think it makes a lot of difference, Your Honor, although it wouldn't change its inherent prejudice."
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.791,640.993,He had already been indicted on these charges of child molestation.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,640.993,648.599,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and there is no doubt that a criminal defendant seated at counsel table is different from everyone else in the courtroom: he is the person indicted."
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.345,679.701,"I guess the jury would say, well, there's a screen there and the only thing that is screened is the witness's view of the defendant."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,682.586,684.188,That may be one inference.
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.188,694.628,"What would the jury think... well, the court doesn't want the witnesses, these children, to see that fellow?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,698.947,701.514,"I think the inferences are clear, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,731.836,733.169,--But that isn't what they were instructed.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,739.572,745.91,"First of all, Your Honor, that is not what the state law states, and it is a misstatement of state law if it's what the judge said."
1987.86-6757,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.91,747.578,"Well, that's what they were told."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,747.578,750.897,"The judge said, provides for; he didn't say mandated."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,799.48,805.467,"Counsel, is the colloquy between the judge and the prosecuting attorney in this record?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,805.467,806.567,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.519,809.953,Yes.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,809.953,814.657,There was an argument that took place prior to trial where--
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.657,816.273,You don't know the exact page?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,821.56,823.512,"--Yes, the early part of the appendix, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.862,828.999,Because you keep emphasizing the fact that this singles them out.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,828.999,829.399,--That is correct.
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,829.399,836.003,"Well, as the Chief Justice said, in a criminal trial, a criminal defendant is automatically singled out."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,836.003,836.553,Absolutely.
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.772,841.64,So you've got to have something more than that.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,841.64,842.99,"I don't think we do, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.759,853.715,"If he is singled out, at most of the trials, the prosecuting witness says, and this is the man that did it."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,853.715,854.248,--That is correct.
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,854.248,858.268,"And the court says, let the record show that is the one he is talking about."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,858.268,859.068,That is correct.
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.068,862.47,That is just the same as is done here.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,862.47,865.422,"No, I beg to differ, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,865.422,872.493,Your additional point is that it says the children are afraid of him.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,881.365,883.634,"Your Honor, if I may respond to that."
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,898.744,899.762,They knew he was in jail.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,899.762,900.845,That he was in jail.
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,900.845,904.897,"Well, this man wasn't in jail."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,904.897,909.201,I think in the same way that jail clothing singled out--
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,909.201,910.734,I don't want to waste your time.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,912.236,913.736,--All right.
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.736,924.961,"Mr. Papak, in Estelle, as I recall, the Court saw no state purpose at all or state inference served by the jail garb."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,927.596,928.23,Convenience.
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.23,935.852,"In here I'm sure that the state argues there is a purpose served here which would distinguish it from Estelle, I think."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,935.852,943.105,"Your Honor, I argue that the need for an interest must be articulated in the record."
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,964.353,970.859,"That's a separate argument, that could have been met in other ways that were less prejudicial in your view."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,970.859,971.242,--Yes.
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,971.242,981.315,But it seems to me your case is different from Estelle in that there was no interest that this Court thought was served by having the guy go to trial in prison garb.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,989.57,991.022,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,994.89,997.092,Why should it be on a case by case basis.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1005.865,1015.304,"Because the court hasn't, within the context of the legislation, made a mandatory determination that in all cases children are traumatized and need protective devices."
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.304,1017.054,Why should it have to be mandatory?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1021.207,1034.598,"That's correct, and that's what they did in this case, but how are we capable of reviewing the discretionary decision by the trial court if he doesn't articulate the basis and the factors that he considered in making that decision."
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.598,1047.525,But all sorts of discretionary decisions made in the criminal process at every stage... and I don't think we've ever said that every discretionary decision must be supported by some articulated basis for it.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1047.525,1064.618,"This Court in the Globe Newspaper Company case suggested that when we are dealing with child witnesses and the potential trauma of courtroom testimony, that there is a clear and easy method of determining on a case by case basis whether we should infringe on First Amendment rights, rights of access."
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.657,1074.009,Why?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1074.009,1076.059,Because this Court has routinely and consistently--
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1076.059,1088.436,"Has this Court ever applied the need for the articulated reason for closing, in the Globe Newspaper case which you refer to, in the context of the criminal process?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1088.436,1089.169,"--No, it has not."
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1128.244,1134.548,Do you think this is a more serious affront to constitutional rights than Holbrook was?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1134.548,1135.917,"Yes, by far, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1135.917,1137.017,In what respect?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1137.017,1148.24,"I think that in Holbrook this Court found that there were many inferences, many of which were not incriminatory, that could be taken by the jury from the use of armed guards in the courtroom."
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1148.24,1154.294,"Uniformed storm troopers almost, with weapons apparent."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1154.294,1156.58,That was certainly the argument--
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1156.58,1157.863,It was made pretty strenuously.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1157.863,1158.98,--of the criminal defendant in that case.
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1191.434,1194.269,What would you be satisfied with in this case?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1194.269,1196.538,"--In this case, Your Honor, I believe that when--"
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1196.538,1197.99,No screen at all?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1197.99,1199.99,--Not in the courtroom.
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1215.0,1221.689,"Well, then aren't you violating some other so-called rights by having a trial outside the courtroom?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1221.689,1222.873,"Yes, you're right, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1246.404,1253.042,You would have been happy with a videotape outside the courtroom?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1253.042,1255.66,A videotape would not have had the same prejudicial impact.
1987.86-6757,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1257.362,1259.246,Would you be content with it is what I am asking.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1259.246,1263.266,"--If there was a showing that it was necessary, Your Honor, yes."
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1274.573,1282.827,Would you be satisfied if the defendant was outside the courtroom in a room with a one way glass looking in?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1282.827,1283.929,--That would be one method.
1987.86-6757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1298.439,1300.723,Are you abandoning your Sixth Amendment claim now?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1300.723,1301.308,"No, I'm not."
1987.86-6757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.308,1303.508,Or are you just addressing the Due Process claim?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1303.508,1305.593,"No, I'm not abandoning my Sixth Amendment claim, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-6757,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.593,1309.913,Do you think it would not offend the Sixth Amendment to put him behind a one way mirror?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1309.913,1319.952,"No, what I said, Your Honor, is that the Sixth Amendment is more flexible, I believe, than the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of the necessity for infringement."
1987.86-6757,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1345.503,1352.923,"Mr. Papak, did the defense make any motion or a hearing to determine the necessity for doing it this way?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1352.923,1354.109,"No, he did not."
1987.86-6757,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1373.321,1384.211,"Suppose there had been such a motion and such a hearing and a determination by the trial court that to proceed with the trial, this device is necessary."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1385.094,1386.028,"Yes, I would."
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.638,1441.148,"It seems to me a normal thing to ask witnesses like that would be, do you see your assailant in this room."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1441.148,1444.267,Yes.
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.267,1451.523,You would think that the screen would completely foreclose an answer to such a question.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1451.523,1451.956,Yes.
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.163,1480.09,"I would think the defense would always want to ask if they knew, which they did from their depositions, that the girls could not identify this person."
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1480.09,1481.125,I'm not sure of that Your Honor.
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.314,1502.955,I don't see any argument by defense counsel that one of the reasons that he is objecting to this is because it will keep me from asking this question.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1502.955,1505.073,"That's right, there is no objection on that behalf."
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.64,1514.013,And I think he said from the depositions it is clear that the young ladies can't identify.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1514.013,1514.396,--That's right.
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1524.202,1534.177,So defense counsel never said the biggest trouble with screen is I can't ask these girls if they can identify the defendant?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1534.177,1544.782,"--No, the defense counsel said the biggest trouble with this screen is that the jury is going to look at it and say that man is obviously guilty and we ought to put him someplace where he can be screened permanently--"
1987.86-6757,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.782,1555.59,And I suppose certainly the prosecution wouldn't have wanted the screen if they thought there could be an in-court identification.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1555.59,1557.023,--I can't speak for the prosecution.
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1557.023,1561.41,But he did say he claimed his Sixth Amendment rights.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1561.41,1564.029,Clearly claimed both Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1564.029,1564.746,Right.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1564.746,1573.218,He claimed on the right of confrontation that there is inherent in confrontation the right to a face to face confrontation in most circumstances.
1987.86-6757,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1573.218,1579.372,"May I ask, what is the definition of a child in Iowa?"
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1579.372,1581.705,With this statute it is fourteen or under.
1987.86-6757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.705,1583.49,Fourteen or under is--
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1583.49,1585.359,At fourteen they're no longer a child.
1987.86-6757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.863,1593.763,--I see.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1598.933,1600.118,Yes.
1987.86-6757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.118,1605.689,Is there anything in the record that tells us whether there were any objection to the Defendant being present at those depositions?
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1605.689,1606.705,There is nothing in the record.
1987.86-6757,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.122,1609.557,He was not at the depositions.
1987.86-6757,0,38220,paul_papak,,1615.911,1631.638,"Your Honor, from start to finish, as far as I can tell, there is absolutely nothing in the record that suggests these two girls were afraid of testifying in the normal procedure in open court without a screen."
1987.86-6757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.25,1675.634,"Thank you, Mr. Papak."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1683.272,1683.839,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1738.174,1745.013,"Mr. Allen, is correct, as I get from the briefs, Iowa is the only state with this kind of a statute?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1745.013,1755.119,"It is the only statute that I know of that specifically provides for the use of a one way screen in the courtroom, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1755.119,1757.903,Do you know what brought it about in Iowa?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1765.093,1771.497,The statute itself was the result of a nationwide effort by the witness protection organization that went around.
1987.86-6757,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1779.667,1781.469,But Iowa is the only one that adopted it?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1781.469,1784.988,"No, the closed-circuit t.v. was also adopted."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1849.646,1853.449,"Mr. Allen, can't you make precisely the same argument the other way?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1861.888,1866.69,"--I differ with that, Your Honor, and for the precise reason that you asked the question of counsel."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1873.613,1877.648,If you say there is a presumption in every case by reason of the legislature's action.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1882.885,1885.437,I believe there is no specific finding by the--
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.437,1886.754,No evidence.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1886.754,1887.887,--But I believe there is evidence.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1887.887,1888.506,What?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1888.506,1893.924,The specific factors that Mr. Papak suggests to this Court that should be looked at can be gleaned from the record.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.93,1903.465,"He hadn't even seen the children before, had he?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1903.465,1907.434,"--He had seen the children at the time of the trial, but he knew their ages."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.434,1909.369,But he ruled before he ever saw the children.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1909.369,1914.69,"Correct, but he knew prior to that time that he knew their ages, he knew their psychological maturity--"
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.69,1916.74,What does that mean?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1918.392,1923.26,--He knew they were thirteen years old and that they were relatively mature for thirteen year olds.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.014,1929.533,How do you know that?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1932.484,1935.201,He could glean that from the record.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.201,1935.719,Where?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1941.59,1942.923,There is no evidence to the contrary.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.923,1943.423,Pardon me?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1943.423,1944.542,There is no evidence to the contrary.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1944.542,1952.879,"Your argument is they haven't put in any evidence of absence of trauma, and all I'm suggesting is you haven't put in any evidence of trauma."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1964.386,1965.288,That's perfectly correct.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.288,1966.855,It says discretion of the trial judge.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1966.855,1969.007,"It is not mandatory, and I think that's the--"
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.007,1976.894,"Then how do we know there's a legislative finding that it must be used in all cases, or that even the inference of trauma is justified in all cases?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1976.894,1978.079,--How do we know that there is?
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.079,1978.879,Yes.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,1984.0,1994.606,"The legislature made a statement of purpose and a statement of finding, and I believe that that statement of purpose, which is contained within the brief, suggests that trauma is the norm."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2000.343,2005.18,"If that statement were that trauma was the norm, it would say that it must be used."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2013.619,2014.202,"No, I would suggest--"
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.202,2015.502,That's all that that means.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2017.571,2030.129,"--If trauma were the norm and that that is in the absolute sense and it would make a mandatory statute, I would suggest that that would deprive the defendant... who is faced with a child witness of extraordinary capabilities... of due process."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.317,2039.85,The child witness of due process?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2039.85,2044.138,"--No, no, the defendant of due process."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.76,2056.279,But where is the rebuttable presumption in the statute?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2059.731,2060.933,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.933,2063.1,I don't find it there.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2064.885,2073.741,"Unlike Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, which specifically says that there is a rebuttable presumption in their statute, Iowa does not specifically say that there is a rebuttable presumption."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.741,2075.007,So there is no rebuttable presumption in the statute.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2075.007,2083.179,"I believe the statute, by the permission given from the legislature based upon their findings to the trial judge, that in itself creates rebuttal."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.179,2088.266,"And that puts the burden on the defendant to explain why the statute is not necessary in the particular case, why the procedure--"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2088.266,2089.683,I would agree.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.683,2092.534,--But that's certainly not based on the text of the statute.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2123.923,2124.773,"No, I disagree."
1987.86-6757,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2149.491,2153.443,"Well, apparently the judge thought he had to do one or the other."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2153.443,2154.193,I don't agree.
1987.86-6757,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2154.626,2159.929,"His instruction reads a little that way, doesn't it?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2159.929,2163.398,--I have to concede that his instruction reads a little that way.
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.848,2170.487,"Yes, and when he was talking about the eyewitness identification he said, yes, there is a real problem about that."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2177.975,2183.312,--I think the instruction goes along with the reason behind what the judge was doing.
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.831,2219.802,Suppose the statute were mandatory every single time.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2224.656,2228.924,I would say that a mandatory statute which provides that the use of a one way--
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.924,2239.315,I take it then that you think it should be on a case to case basis of whether there was a danger of trauma or not.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2239.315,2243.869,--What I think it should be is that there should be a rebuttable presumption that trauma is the norm.
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.093,2263.331,How does a defense counsel satisfy that kind of a burden with respect to prosecution witnesses?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2263.331,2265.966,"--By the first instance, raising an objection which this Defendant--"
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.966,2266.716,"Well, they did."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2266.716,2267.266,--never did.
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.266,2268.651,They certainly did.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2268.651,2275.472,"No, if you read carefully what this Defendant did, this Defendant said this is inherently prejudicial, it violates my rights."
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.052,2299.587,How could he say anything factual about these witnesses?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2299.587,2301.706,"--He could have had a hearing, as Justice Marshall suggested."
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.089,2304.258,"I guess he took their depositions, didn't he?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2304.258,2305.808,--He did take their depositions.
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.023,2337.729,"Mr. Allen, let's talk about one of the bases for a categorical objection to it, and that's the Sixth Amendment."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2393.632,2397.636,"Well that in part, and I want to address that secondly."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.975,2410.86,That's what confront means.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2410.86,2419.549,These children did stand face to face with the Defendant in front of the jury so that the jury could in fact view their demeanor while--
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.549,2423.751,The whole purpose of it was to prevent them from having to look him in the eye.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2437.578,2438.78,--It's one theory.
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.78,2440.963,It's why they use the word confront.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2461.61,2472.001,"This Court has historically said that confrontation includes the right to have an oath, the right to be in front of a jury, the right to know the demeanor, and the right to have unlimited cross examination."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.001,2473.784,--Those were hard cases.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2479.922,2482.457,All of which this Defendant had.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.379,2493.597,And dimly see them according to the way the judge described it when he looked through the screen.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2493.597,2495.049,But nevertheless see them.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2495.049,2495.349,No.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2536.61,2538.11,To every criminal case?
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.11,2541.245,To every rape case with children involved.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2541.245,2549.501,"I believe it applies to every case wherein the child is under the age of the definition of child, which is fourteen and under in Iowa."
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2549.501,2552.953,And you must put the screen up?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2552.953,2554.155,No.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2559.29,2561.309,And discretion to the judge?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2561.309,2562.678,--Discretion to the judge.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2562.678,2572.949,"Well, will you tell me in this record where the judge says, in my discretion, I rule that the screen must be used in this case?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2572.949,2582.889,"He does not specifically say that, but the two hearings that he has are contained in A 10 through 17 wherein he discusses the objections--"
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2582.889,2590.495,Don't miss page 18 while you're at it.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2601.386,2602.069,--No.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2602.069,2603.486,"He never said it, did he?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2603.486,2604.837,He did not say--
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2604.837,2610.639,So what he said was this statute applies automatically.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2610.639,2611.991,--He never said that either.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2611.991,2616.109,But isn't that some of what he said?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2616.109,2618.742,"I don't believe so, what I believe he was doin--"
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.742,2620.577,What do you believe he said.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2620.577,2623.779,I believe he thinks he was exercising discretion.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2623.779,2625.048,He said that?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2625.048,2625.831,No.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2630.0,2633.219,Don't you think he was obliged to say something?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2635.837,2642.074,"Your Honor, I am here on a record that I think I would be obliged to say could be a little better, as Mr. Papak would say."
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.074,2643.676,"Oh, you would like a better record."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2647.461,2649.746,"There's no doubt about that, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.746,2652.282,"Mr. Allen, may I ask you another question about the statute."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2662.554,2668.542,It is contained within a statute which is in our Iowa code in the criminal provision.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.077,2681.134,"It would apply in a robbery case where the child was just a witness to some phase of the robbery, not necessarily saw the actual event?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2681.134,2682.901,By the terms of the statute I believe it would.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.901,2685.336,It could if it was a very traumatized child?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2685.336,2686.103,I believe it would.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.125,2773.827,"Mr. Allen, you can't really predict that here."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2786.985,2788.487,--That's conceivable.
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.487,2793.308,You don't have to have fourteen psychiatrists testify when things are rather clear.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2793.308,2816.054,"No, you don't, and our interest is that you do not, because if that is the kind of hearing that Mr. Papak suggests, that will necessarily preclude the use of these alternative devices in most cases in small towns or small cities of Iowa simply because the expense to both the victim and the expense to the state will limit it to the most egregious kinds of cases."
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2863.702,2870.475,There's not one word in this record that the person involved asked for this.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2870.475,2873.593,The county attorney filed a formal motion.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2873.593,2881.163,"There's not one word that says either the child, the parent, or anybody asked for this."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2881.163,2882.698,Conceded.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2893.471,2896.625,Wouldn't your record have been better if he'd said they asked me to do it?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2896.625,2899.425,"--I agree with that also, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.516,2910.966,He said that there not be a trial?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2910.966,2913.068,"--No trauma, Your Honor."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.068,2915.67,"Mr. Allen, let me ask you another question about your legal position."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2938.035,2946.808,"The short answer is that for the 85 year old who is scared to death to testify, I believe the one way mirror is permissible but I would differentiate in this regard."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.34,2971.273,Or a 55 year old.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2972.556,2976.91,"I think a 55 year old could use the screen, but at their request."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.91,2990.402,"So all you have to say is I will be traumatized by confronting the person I am accusing, and that's all it takes to say, that's okay then, if you'll be traumatized by confronting the person you are accusing, you don't have to confront them."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,2993.956,2995.389,That is not what I'm saying.
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.227,3005.763,"No, I am assuming that I can prove it."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3013.0,3026.427,"--Then we are back to differentiating again on the definition of confrontation, and I don't think that there is any case that this Court has said that eyeballing someone or forcing a glare on someone is contained within the confrontation clause."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.427,3039.651,"I don't think there's any case we've decided that says that any instance in which a witness has to be present in a courtroom, he can be present in that courtroom without confronting, that is being eye to eye with the defendant."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3042.853,3051.292,"I know of several where we have not, and to use your carrying the argument on further, can that be used offensively."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.85,3066.385,"Probably not, but if he looks away like that the jury can draw some conclusions from that."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3070.354,3082.312,"I think if the judge cannot compel that witness to look at the defendant under the Sixth Amendment, then I think the Sixth Amendment does not contain an eye to eye confrontation requirement."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.048,3093.166,"All right, I'll say face to face."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3093.166,3097.737,"I think these witnesses, this defendant were given face to face confrontation."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.891,3106.026,"He saw her face, she didn't see his face."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3106.026,3110.461,"She didn't see his, but the jury saw both."
1987.86-6757,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3110.461,3122.969,"Of course, all this argument overlooks the obvious fact that some prosecutor or defense counsel and some witnesses are blind, and yet it doesn't cause us a great deal of trouble."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3125.887,3135.629,"That was raised by one of the amicus, that a blind defendant would have a tough time with face to face confrontation if it were taken to its logical conclusion."
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3178.106,3182.76,It seems to be a Due Process problem if there is a problem at all.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3182.76,3184.26,--If there is a problem at all--
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3184.26,3190.33,Because the confrontation clause is just beside the point.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3201.721,3206.625,"--So long as the essential elements of the Sixth Amendment are provided, yes."
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.125,3213.795,So just so the jury can see him and the witness.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3213.795,3216.664,And that the testimony is taken under oath--
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.664,3219.849,"Yes, and that the defendant can see the witness."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3219.849,3226.789,"--So that in the language of California v. Green, so that the circumstances closely approximate a trial."
1987.86-6757,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.789,3234.375,So that just leaves the question of prejudice from the way they do it.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3234.375,3235.977,I would say that's correct.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3251.087,3257.808,When did these two young girls identify this man?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3257.808,3268.116,"They did not, Your Honor, and that leads right to my next issue, which is that if there is a rebuttable presumption, and if there is evidence--"
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3268.116,3272.75,A man who was never identified and he was convicted.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3272.75,3274.769,--They did not identify him because they could not.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3283.975,3286.493,"Well, then why were they scared to look at him?"
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3286.493,3287.927,--I think you have to understand--
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3287.927,3291.814,They couldn't identify him.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3291.814,3297.968,"--Trauma, as the commentators will tell you, and it's listed in all the amicus, is really on several levels."
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3303.955,3308.574,I don't find one word of trauma in this record.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3308.574,3309.859,--It is presumed.
1987.86-6757,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3311.643,3320.397,"I have difficulty in deciding cases on presumptions, I have great difficulty."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3328.003,3330.021,"Circumstantially identifiable, yes."
1987.86-6757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.543,3344.78,"I mean, part of their testimony was critical in hooking up the Defendant to this particular incident."
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3344.78,3349.582,And in the identification of the items which were found in his house.
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3416.71,3419.578,Don't you think the judge would have gotten made if he had tried to do that?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3420.962,3422.53,--The judge offered him that opportunity.
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.53,3423.697,--The judge said he could do that?
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3423.697,3434.588,"The judge said, if we have an identification question, obviously we are going to have a problem under this statute, and he in fact told the jury that the one way mirror might have to be removed."
1987.86-6757,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3434.588,3443.294,I didn't interpret that to mean if we had an identification question that the defense itself chose to raise in the fashion you've just said.
1987.86-6757,1,24894,gorden_e_allen,,3451.198,3455.252,I take that from a reading of the transcript.
1987.86-6757,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3518.759,3519.944,"Thank you, Mr. Allen."
1987.86-6757,2,38220,paul_papak,,3524.146,3526.098,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-6757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3574.996,3581.149,The court... do you think with respect to face to face confrontation +/-
1987.86-6757,2,38220,paul_papak,,3581.149,3582.049,Why is it?
1987.86-6757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3582.049,3590.671,What is the closest case in this Court suggesting that the confrontation clause requires face to face--
1987.86-6757,2,38220,paul_papak,,3590.671,3594.457,"--Well, the Court has historically discussed face to face confrontation."
1987.86-6757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3599.611,3601.813,--I just asked you about a case.
1987.86-6757,2,38220,paul_papak,,3601.813,3602.963,--Ohio v. Roberts.
1987.86-6757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3610.067,3619.541,"I know, but what is the case that says that to satisfy the confrontation clause there must be eyeball to eyeball or face to face."
1987.86-6757,2,38220,paul_papak,,3619.541,3621.075,--Mattox says face to face.
1987.86-6757,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3628.13,3629.113,None in this Court.
1987.86-6757,2,38220,paul_papak,,3629.113,3630.446,"None in this Court, that is correct."
1987.86-6757,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3634.367,3637.902,"Only because the word confront means face to face, that's the only reason."
1987.86-6757,2,38220,paul_papak,,3637.902,3638.552,Exactly.
1987.86-6757,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3685.383,3686.583,"Thank you, Mr. Papak."
