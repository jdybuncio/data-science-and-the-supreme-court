1978.77-874,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.029,-- Justice Brennan.
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,18.98,19.86,Thank you Your Honor.
1978.77-874,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,275.084,276.88,And you're here under the written order clause?
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,276.88,277.751,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-874,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,299.356,304.443,Would you say that this is not the core of the purpose that Congress had in mind?
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,304.443,308.049,"By this displacement, yes."
1978.77-874,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,580.812,590.959,"Is it your contention that the word ""person"" in 206 (b) is more broadly defined than the term “displaced person” in the definitional section?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,590.959,593.552,"I think that's a fair reading of the statute, yes, sir."
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,608.733,615.131,"Mr. Vanderstar, you don't see any connection between the acquisition and the written order section?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,615.131,616.474,"Well, I don't think there's a connection --"
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,616.474,618.574,Are they entirely different in your view?
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,618.574,618.989,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,624.597,629.497,"Well, if your just on the acquisition, you don't need a written order or anything?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,629.497,630.884,That's right and I think that helps to explain --
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,630.884,634.297,"And therefore if you, on the written order you don't need the acquisition?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,634.297,637.802,"Exactly, exactly."
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,643.882,646.966,Is that the main point that is before us right now?
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,646.966,647.882,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,647.882,651.046,That's why he was so willing to drop the acquisition point.
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,651.046,653.225,"Well, because."
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,653.225,655.582,"If you keep that when you're gone, --"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,655.582,659.182,"Well, it's a weaker argument I can see that, Your Honor."
1978.77-874,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.548,767.454,Isn't one place that might come from the fact that traditionally under eminent domain cases moving costs were not an allowable element of just compensation and Congress has decided to add that as an element of just compensation here?
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,767.454,773.158,That's one permissive –- one possible interpretation but I don't think it's permissible interpretation.
1978.77-874,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.158,775.021,You say permissive but not permissible?
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,775.021,780.292,"No, I say it's one possible interpretation but I don't think it's a permissible interpretation."
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,783.901,787.756,This should not -- this is not eminent domain case because you are not acquiring this.
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,788.933,789.732,That's correct.
1978.77-874,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.548,793.151,"You mean that they can't do it, this has nothing to do with this case."
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,793.151,794.588,"No, sir."
1978.77-874,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.768,853.989,But what about the person who simply defaults in their rent and has given a written notice to move from the property because of default?
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,876.714,878.436,"Well, what's lacking?"
1978.77-874,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.916,885.854,One thing is lacking is the program or project.
1978.77-874,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,899.428,910.281,"Well, a program is simply not to allow tenants to remain in the property who don't pay their rent or who are very destructive or whatever, that's part of the program?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,910.281,911.022,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-874,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,923.474,931.695,"It does come, what as my Brother Rehnquist suggests that that seem to come within the literal language of the statute, if your case does."
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,931.695,933.488,I think the cases are quite different.
1978.77-874,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,933.488,941.057,The cases are factually quite different but the question is whether or not they fall under the literal language of the statute as you construe.
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,941.057,945.227,I don't think so because I construe the words program or project in a different way.
1978.77-874,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,959.14,964.196,"Well, you would precisely describe that Mr. Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical case."
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,964.196,966.506,"I don't think so, Your Honor, with all due respect."
1978.77-874,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,966.506,969.838,Then it's an eminent domain type of case.
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,987.742,991.115,"Well, eminent domain, there is no eminent domain used here."
1978.77-874,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.002,1151.281,"You necessarily treat the Government's efforts to collect on its indebtedness as a program in the same sense that building a bridge or a new road or new highway is a program, is that so?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1151.281,1152.549,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-874,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1183.566,1190.977,"Exclusions as a bank when it tries to collect from its debts on its guarantees, does it not?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1190.977,1193.17,"Well, it functions as a creditor when tries to collect all its debts."
1978.77-874,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1193.17,1196.709,It functions the same way a bank does when a bank forecloses a mortgage.
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1196.709,1198.004,"Not completely, Your Honor."
1978.77-874,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1204.216,1208.04,"Well, the mechanics are the same are they not?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1208.04,1212.962,The mechanics may be the same but the decisional process is very different.
1978.77-874,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.207,1231.129,This program wasn't doing that.
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1231.129,1231.532,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1978.77-874,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.532,1235.899,"This program wasn't doing that, this was disposing a house that they couldn't use."
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1235.899,1241.627,"Well, it wasn't -- the housing they couldn't use, it was housing that didn't feel like paying to rehabilitate."
1978.77-874,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.251,1248.763,"In this particular program, decrease the total amount of housing available to the people they are intending to serve."
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1248.763,1250.152,"Indeed, it did."
1978.77-874,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.152,1267.386,"If they had instead of foreclosing -- instead of evicting themselves just after they foreclosed, sold the property to some private entity and not the private the party, do the eviction and destruction and so forth, and rehabilitation, then I gather you've had -- there'd be no claim because it would not be the acquiring agency that did the evicting."
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1267.386,1269.204,That would be a much tougher case.
1978.77-874,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1269.204,1283.377,"Can you tell me, you mentioned that 10 years of study of this problem by Congress, how much of that study was included discussion of problem associated with foreclosure of mortgages and the eviction of people from projects like that?"
1978.77-874,0,33360,john_vanderstar,,1283.377,1295.739,"None that we can find, Your Honor and I think the principle reason is that those programs, most of them didn't exist in those days, the 236 program for example that the Sky Tower project was subsidized under."
1978.77-874,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1317.275,1321.831,"Very well, Mr. Vanderstar."
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1324.374,1325.782,Thank you.
1978.77-874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1380.564,1387.202,"It could be -- it could be by lease you could just be taking possession, couldn't you?"
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1387.202,1389.43,It could be acquiring a property until so that sort.
1978.77-874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.688,1392.163,It need not be a fee?
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1392.163,1394.594,"It does not have to be a fee, that's correct."
1978.77-874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1623.872,1627.785,You think it's a present participle not an adjective.
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1627.785,1628.54,Exactly.
1978.77-874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.25,2424.084,"Mr. Bryson, before you sit down, I think there were as I remember the facts, some of the people from Sky Tower who did receive $300.00 of some kind of relocation system."
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2424.084,2424.995,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1978.77-874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.995,2427.887,Pursuant to what statutory authority was that going to be?
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2427.887,2436.195,"Well, I believe Mr. Justice Stevens that that was under the general authority of the Housing Act."
1978.77-874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.268,2460.37,Go ahead continue.
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2460.37,2482.392,"I was simply going to point out that that money was given to those people who were current in their rents and it was an attempt and an accommodation that we may find through further legislation, we may find some kind of more explicit statutory authority for but right now, the authority is rather vague."
1978.77-874,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.392,2491.042,"And there's also been a, there's a motion to dismissed, its writ has been probably granted, I believe filed by your opponent and I believe they called our attention."
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2503.741,2507.928,"No, there are several different points on this core Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.77-874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2531.674,2533.541,And that statute was enacted this year?
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2533.541,2536.912,"Yes, that was enacted in, I think it was signed October 31st."
1978.77-874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2550.604,2554.86,Is this kind of a directorate to tell HUD they will minimize the number of evictions?
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2554.86,2555.448,Exactly.
1978.77-874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2555.448,2557.16,And then requiring HUD to report?
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2557.16,2558.055,Exactly.
1978.77-874,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2558.055,2560.217,As to the success of such minimizations?
1978.77-874,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2560.217,2561.988,Exactly.
1978.77-874,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.299,2633.382,Thank you Mr. Bryson.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2635.515,2637.164,Yes Your Honor thank you.
1978.77-874,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.945,2738.363,"Mr. Vanderstar, would it not be possible if there will be a written order before the acquisition was consummated?"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2738.363,2741.301,I don't think you'd call that a written order and HUD does not.
1978.77-874,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.006,2779.413,How could that be covered if he didn't have the written order clause?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2779.413,2782.517,I think it could be covered under either clause as the Latham case in the Ninth Circuit.
1978.77-874,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.517,2788.998,How can it be covered if there are written notice of intent to acquire but no acquisition and a written order to vacate?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2791.349,2794.491,"Well, it wouldn't be a written order to vacate if it please the Court."
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2802.413,2814.832,"Well the statute, just looking at it, there's second or third reason, evem third was seems to provide two, only two alternatives."
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2814.832,2818.283,"Well, there are two alternative clauses but there may be lots of cases that are covered by --"
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2818.283,2822.092,(Voice Overlap) the acquisition or as a result of a written order.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2824.641,2839.512,I understand that and it's rather curious -- it's rather curious that the Government does not want the Court to apply the statute the way we think it was written but concedes that it does apply in the case that the language doesn't cover.
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.529,2843.548,"Now, what, I don't quite understand that."
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2845.654,2855.68,"The Government concedes indeed, asserts that a written notice of intent to acquire even when there's no acquisition is covered by the statute."
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.68,2857.207,I didn't so understand it though.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2858.512,2860.354,That's the Mr. Jones example that Mr. Bryson talked about.
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2860.354,2863.617,"Well, but that was a written order."
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2863.617,2865.759,That was a written notice of intent to acquire?
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2865.759,2866.846,Sent to Mr. Jones.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2866.846,2868.05,That's right.
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2869.787,2873.993,"And therefore Mr. Jones, you have to get out and why isn't that a written order?"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2873.993,2879.858,Not have to get out but you'd be smart to get out because we're going to acquire this property a year from now.
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2881.776,2882.966,I see.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2882.966,2887.461,"We're going to acquire this property a year from now, we're giving you notice of our intent to do so."
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2909.778,2917.131,The written order clause does require that the written order come from the “acquiring agency” doesn't it?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2917.131,2917.752,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2917.752,2923.064,So don't you think that that must contemplate an acquisition as well as the first clause?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2923.064,2925.802,Yes and there was an acquisition in both of these cases.
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2925.802,2929.325,So the written order isn't separate and apart from an acquisition.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2929.325,2929.438,Oh!
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2933.243,2938.898,But there must be a proposed acquisition at least and in both cases?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2938.898,2939.74,"Yes, that's right."
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2939.74,2943.307,"Well, no, your point is that the acquisition kind of occurred in the past?"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2943.307,2943.443,Oh!
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2944.973,2946.924,Therefore it's not a proposed acquisition.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2949.688,2950.08,Proposed or --
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2950.08,2955.05,-- and the acquiring agency has ownership or occupancy of the premises.
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2956.51,2956.696,You --
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2956.696,2957.651,That's exactly right.
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2957.651,2973.958,"You mean that if HUD acquired property in 1957, that would qualify it as an acquiring agency and then if it gives notice to vacate in 1977, it comes under the written order clause?"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2973.958,2974.578,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2975.795,2975.809,That's exactly his omission.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2975.809,2982.409,"Congress said so in Section 219 which is not codified, it's the so-called Mary Hill Section."
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2995.061,2998.26,Was that relied on by the lower court?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,2998.26,3000.254,"I believe it was referred to, yes."
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.254,3001.571,Was it relied on?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3001.571,3004.447,"Yes, I think so but I'm not positive of that."
1978.77-874,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3006.845,3010.533,Which Court of Appeals with the District Columbia Circuit?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3010.533,3011.753,I can't be certain of that.
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.753,3012.682,May I ask you again.
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.334,3022.217,Yes.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3022.217,3023.362,"Yes, they are."
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3023.362,3026.246,But now you're saying they're the same.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3026.246,3026.718,"No, sir."
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3026.858,3033.004,You said that it would probably was acquired in 1950?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3039.852,3048.645,"If there's a written order to vacate in 1977 that otherwise meets the statutory language, the fact that the acquisition occurred 20 years earlier is irrelevant."
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3048.645,3053.832,"Well, it would be awful hard to get any eminent domain 20 years later, isn't it?"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3053.832,3053.944,That's right.
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3053.944,3054.781,Wouldn't it be?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3054.781,3058.304,That's right that's why I said this is not an eminent domain statute.
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3059.75,3061.488,What is eminent domain?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3061.488,3063.619,It is a displacement statute.
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3063.913,3065.596,A displacement at any time?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3065.596,3066.106,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3066.106,3068.528,So you don't need the acquisition in that at all?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3068.528,3071.18,"Well, you need to have an acquisition at some point in the past because --"
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.18,3075.477,"No, he may be talking about federal property that it had to be acquired."
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3079.283,3085.115,I don't think the acquisition is very important but it is in the statute and we meet it in the facts of this case.
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3085.115,3088.432,"It was based on it, the whole statute was based on acquisition."
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3088.432,3094.661,"The order has to come from the agency that acquired the property, doesn't it, under the clear cut of the statute?"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3094.661,3095.551,Yes.
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3096.079,3097.469,From the acquiring agency?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3097.469,3098.715,"Yes, that's right."
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3098.715,3105.736,So if an agency -- so acquisition is key and crucial in that sense?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3105.736,3108.212,Acquisition at some time in the past is important.
1978.77-874,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.711,3114.235,So every owner is an acquiring agency within the meaning that you gave?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3114.235,3114.916,That's right.
1978.77-874,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.916,3115.948,Cause it had to acquire at some point?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3115.948,3116.434,That's right.
1978.77-874,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.181,3119.938,"When acquiring really, this adds nothing to the statute."
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3119.938,3122.071,Except that it identifies which agency issues --
1978.77-874,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.071,3123.626,"You could say owner, the owning agency --"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3123.626,3126.863,It could have said owning agency but it said acquiring agency.
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.553,3132.859,And I suppose the United States itself would qualify under your view?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3132.859,3135.543,"Well, normally it's a particular agency that issues it."
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3135.543,3139.387,I know but what if it were the United States?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3140.086,3140.939,I suppose --
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.939,3146.729,Anybody (Voice Overlap) who was displaced from any property that the United States or any of its agencies owns is covered by the statute?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3146.729,3149.202,"If it's for program or project, yes, sir."
1978.77-874,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3149.202,3160.07,So the wife or the acquiring agency have got out of this if you're correct as to convey it to a private person and then have him issue the notice?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3160.07,3160.98,That might be a way out.
1978.77-874,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3160.98,3165.036,"Well, the way is not to acquire?"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3165.036,3167.475,Or not to displace people.
1978.77-874,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.475,3168.328,Would -- would there be --
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.328,3169.354,Let me ask you one more question if you please.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3169.354,3171.124,Yes.
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.124,3183.305,You understand the United States position here to be similar or close to the positions taken by the courts that have held contrary to the District of Columbia?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3183.305,3187.547,The United States position -- the Seventh Circuit opinion is a little bit unclear.
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.654,3195.303,"How about the Second Circuit, is it, has the United States always taken the same position in this various courts?"
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3195.303,3196.34,"Yes, I think it has."
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.478,3208.378,But any of the courts have held against your position have in the main agreed with the United States present position?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3208.378,3210.969,"That's only one court, the Seventh Circuit in this case."
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.969,3212.929,Are there some district courts too?
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3212.929,3213.723,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1978.77-874,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.723,3214.29,Okay.
1978.77-874,2,33360,john_vanderstar,,3214.693,3216.059,Not under written order clause.
1978.77-874,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3216.059,3216.712,Thank you gentlemen.
