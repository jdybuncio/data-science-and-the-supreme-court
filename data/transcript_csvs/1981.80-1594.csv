1981.80-1594,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,We will hear arguments next in United States against Erika.
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,54.901,61.905,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims."
1981.80-1594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,72.029,75.148,"Tell me, Mr. Kneedler, do we reach this if we affirm the last case?"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,79.866,80.368,Yes.
1981.80-1594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,107.352,108.152,"Mr. Kneedler, may I ask one--"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,108.152,108.619,--Yes.
1981.80-1594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,108.619,112.437,"--May I ask a preliminary question, like Justice Brennan did, the converse of his question?"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,134.503,137.889,"Well, I guess that would depend on the... on the--"
1981.80-1594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,137.889,138.472,"I mean, if we affirmed."
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,140.341,147.177,--I guess that would depend on the... on the scope that the Court found of the court of claims review.
1981.80-1594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,164.972,165.772,But let me rephrase it.
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,172.645,173.412,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1981.80-1594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,212.701,213.786,Thank you.
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,213.786,222.159,"As I mentioned, the Part A program provides insurance for hospital and related post-hospital services."
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.29,685.176,"Well, those are quite different questions, I suppose, aren't they?"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,688.044,688.796,That's correct.
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.246,691.013,--and still win on the first.
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,691.013,691.463,--That's correct.
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.767,755.353,And waive sovereign immunity?
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,755.353,756.069,And waive sovereign immunity.
1981.80-1594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.138,788.338,"Mr. Kneedler, can I interrupt again?"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,800.396,800.896,Yes.
1981.80-1594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.676,830.515,"And so for purposes of our analysis, it is the government's position that the carrier really is the Secretary within the meaning of all the relevant statutes."
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,830.515,833.967,"That's right, for... particularly for purposes of Section 405(h)."
1981.80-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,837.435,837.952,Mr. Kneedler?
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,837.952,838.335,--Yes.
1981.80-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,838.335,844.675,"Under your view, would... are there any limitations to control a carrier's discretion?"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,857.583,862.653,"Well, the most important protection is the Secretary's oversight of the... of the carrier's performance."
1981.80-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,878.246,887.768,Is there any right of a beneficiary to take action against the Secretary if the Secretary fails in the duty of oversight?
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,887.768,893.856,There is no... There is no provision in the... in the Act for that to be done as an initial matter.
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.464,1139.868,"Well, that point has nothing to do with the court of claims or waiver of sovereign immunity."
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1147.205,1149.824,"That's correct, although I--"
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.824,1156.577,"And isn't... in that context, isn't the presumption normally in favor of reviewability, if that is all you are talking about?"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1156.577,1208.778,"--Yes, if this were a standard APA type judicial review of agency action, that would be so, but there is another feature of the Medicare Act which runs up against that presumption, and that is Section 405(h), but while this case specifically concerns the court of claims' Tucker Act jurisdiction, we submit that the provisions that Congress has... or Congress's failure to provide some other method of judicial review is equally relevant, because again the standard provision for judicial review of determinations under the Social Security Act, whether it is under the old age and survivor portion or under Part B of Medicare, or SSI, is through Section 405(g) of the Social Security Act, standard review in the district court, and an action filed within 60 days after the individual determination by the Secretary that is being challenged."
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.89,1240.333,"Well, if the court of claims is right, why couldn't anyone just, except for sovereign immunity, you could just get review in the district court, if they are right about reviewability."
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1240.333,1246.47,"--Well, the... if there would be review anywhere, it would ordinarily be the district court."
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.47,1246.803,Yes.
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1246.803,1263.43,"That's correct, but Congress has separately addressed that problem by barring review there, but the court of claims has inappropriately applied the presumption in favor of judicial review to the... to the court of claims in which the... the opposite principles apply that a right of action does not exist unless Congress has affirmatively granted it."
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.33,1574.048,"Well, it could have--"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1574.048,1574.932,"Well, it--"
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.932,1577.167,"--made it express in the Act, Mr. Kneedler."
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1577.167,1578.367,"--I suppose, but it did--"
1981.80-1594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1578.367,1579.633,Then you wouldn't be here.
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1579.633,1591.841,"--It is... it is expressed in the Act in our view in Section 405(h) of the... in Section 405(h) of the Social Security Act, the preclusion of judicial review is expressed."
1981.80-1594,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.841,1593.893,You are just arguing that it can't be implied.
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1593.893,1600.53,"Certainly as to Tucker Act jurisdiction, that would be contrary to the established rule and this Court's decisions."
1981.80-1594,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.53,1603.148,"Do you have to do any more than that, in your view?"
1981.80-1594,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1603.148,1603.598,Not in this case.
1981.80-1594,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1607.952,1615.542,Mr. Oleskey.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1615.542,1636.706,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think there is some agreement between the government and Erika on some of the issues that were discussed by Mr. Kneedler and also earlier by the Solicitor General in the McClure case."
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.639,1732.35,"Well, would you... would you say it would be unconstitutional for the... for the law to have precluded review if the system had been wholly... if the claim system and the review system had been carried out by government officials, by the Secretary's people itself?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1732.35,1732.933,Well--
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1732.933,1734.716,Would you have to be able to get into court?
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1734.716,1751.578,"--I would say in that case that you would go to the test, Mr. Justice White, that the Court articulated in Mathews and Eldridge, and balance the interest if there was an unequivocal indication that, I think as you asked earlier, there bad been no intent to provide any review."
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.193,1860.799,"Well, how do you get into court in the first place if Congress says there simply is to be no judicial review of these decisions?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1860.799,1870.589,"--Well, that is the point at which the government and Erika in this case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as well as, I think, eight of the nine circuits that have considered the issue disagree."
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.681,1886.95,I was asking a hypothetical question.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1897.572,1910.299,"Well, I think that is pretty much the question I have tried to answer to Mr. Justice White, and my view would be, if it is clearly and unequivocally expressed and you apply the Mathews and Eldridge balancing test of private interest, government interest--"
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.299,1915.118,"Well, how do you get to Mathews and Eldridge if Congress says there shall be no judicial review?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1915.118,1918.822,"--Well, this is the question that the circuits have come up against, and every one of them has said--"
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.822,1919.788,What is your answer?
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1919.788,1936.799,"--My answer is that where the protective property right, which the government has conceded today again, is involved, you can't take it away without some right of review in a court, at least a property right of this nature, which we say is contractual, unlike the right in Salfi under the Social Security Act--"
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.799,1939.485,So you would say that it wouldn't be a suit against the United States at all.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1939.485,1940.301,--No.
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.301,1945.822,It would be a suit against an officer who is an ex parte Young officer.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1945.822,1947.755,"Well, we would say--"
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.755,1956.445,And that you could... it would be a review... It would be review of an erroneous official decision.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1956.445,1957.38,--We would say--
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.38,1958.38,Contrary to the law.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1958.38,1971.387,--We would say in some cases that the mandamus statute may be properly invoked against the Secretary if his... if his action is egregious enough and if there is no money claim which can otherwise be presented in the court of claims.
1981.80-1594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.347,2019.103,"Mr. Oleskey, you emphasize the point that you rely on a contractual claim here, whereas Salfi involve a claim that Congress could revoke."
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2025.357,2025.574,That's right.
1981.80-1594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.059,2032.528,And why does the beneficiary here have a greater contractual claim than a social security claimant?
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2032.528,2055.643,"Well, I would say principally, Mr. Justice Stevens, because the beneficiary here, rather than simply having benefitted as someone whose wages were taken involuntarily over the course of his working life under the social security system, has voluntary agreed with the government to make an extra payment monthly, which as I say is now $11, in order to have the benefit of Part B coverage."
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.87,2500.529,"Well, Testan and Hopkins, and cases like that, where we have held the court of claims overreached itself under the Tucker Act, certainly weren't barred by those three examples that you gave of limitations on court of claims jurisdiction."
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2500.529,2520.341,"--That's correct, but in Testan, for example, when you examine the two statutes which the Petitioners had pointed to for the substantive rights, there being no contract claim, unlike this case, you found that neither the Back Pay Act nor the Classification Act conferred a substantive right for money damages for the misclassification that had gone on."
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.885,2547.608,"But Salfi, of course, was described as an insurance policy, but clearly there is no contractual right under Fleming against Nestor."
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2547.608,2558.382,"That's correct, and I tried to recognize that by addressing the contractual nature of the relationship here, and how I believe it differs from that of a social security beneficiary as discussed in Salfi."
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.985,2597.943,"Well, what about Senator Bennett's statement in connection with the 1972 amendments, where they found some of the lower courts were allowing the thing to be circumvented, which very, very frequently happens?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2597.943,2617.338,"Senator Bennett and the other decisions which... the other language which the government cites in its legislative history record indicates clearly a Congressional concern that the courts not be flooded with administrative... pure administrative review decisions under Part B, thousands of little decisions."
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.494,2722.671,"Well, if we... if we construe the Act together with such history as the government contends, then must we, because you present the issue, reach a constitutional issue?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2726.573,2733.227,"I... the constitutional issue does not have to be met, because we say--"
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.227,2744.701,"Well, I know, but suppose we agree with the government that the Act, properly construed, precludes review in the court of claims, that Congress intended not to provide the review."
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2752.206,2760.46,"--Well, I understand well this Court's concern that you not address constitutional conflict like that if you need not."
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.512,2765.945,Yes.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2766.262,2769.214,"--Then I think you have a constitutional problem, yes."
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.214,2777.67,"Well, have you presented it as an appellee?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2777.67,2778.003,"Yes, we have."
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.203,2807.189,Is that the most you say about it?
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2807.189,2835.774,"Well, I made the point earlier, I hope, that where a property right is involved, where there is this concededly unparalleled allegation to a private entity, here, an insurance company, sometimes Blue Cross-Blue Shield, to make final and irrevocable decisions about the disposition of that property, if you buy the... if you accept the government's position, I think there is a constitutional issue about whether Congress acted properly."
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.38,2868.412,"So you are saying... apparently your submission is that even if all the claims machinery was inside... was in the hands of the Secretary's own people, and he had given them a fair hearing, that unless judicial review is provided, we have a constitutional issue."
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2868.412,2893.38,"--Well, I say, if the Secretary has the mechanism, which he doesn't here, it is all in the carrier, there is no right of appeal to the Secretary, and no judicial review from that point, then you go back and look at your language about the clear and unequivocal intent of Congress to withdraw jurisdiction, and if you find that you still have to apply the Mathews and Eldridge three-pronged test balancing those interests, but that is not this case."
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.865,2899.367,Yes.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2899.367,2901.484,--in any respect on a Part B benefit.
1981.80-1594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.484,2915.31,"Yes, but what if we... what if we agree with the government in the other case, that that is not a biased procedure or anything of the kind, and it is a full and fair hearing?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2917.245,2938.176,"If you agree with the government in McClure that the district court should be reversed, you still have the problem of decisions as to the constitutionality of the Act or regulations or... or regulations under the Act which are beyond the power of the Secretary himself to deal with, because he is the Secretary."
1981.80-1594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3011.288,3016.69,"Yes, but Mr. Oleskey, those are cases involving regulation rather than contracting, the government as a contracting party."
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3031.35,3037.353,"--Well, the Tucker Act is an explicit decision by Congress, which is obviously exemplified in other areas, too, that would--"
1981.80-1594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3037.353,3039.788,We are just confining ourselves to the constitutional question.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3053.465,3062.921,"--I would say, given the nature of the contractual and statutory rights involved here, if I have fairly defined them, the answer is, no, it wouldn't be constitutional, but you don't have--"
1981.80-1594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3062.921,3063.421,What about my case?
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3073.278,3076.028,"--Well, I see a difference there, because in buying a battleship there is some--"
1981.80-1594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.028,3080.115,"Well, whether there is a difference or not, do you doubt the constitutionality of such a statute?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3080.115,3112.586,"--Well, I can't answer the question fairly, Mr. Justice Stevens, as posed that way, but I think there is a freedom of contract involved in dealing in that situation which may be held by this Court not to be capable of being vindicated by any court, but here, you have beneficiaries who have agreed to pay their premiums monthly in order to receive payment or compensation from the government determined by a reasonable charge mechanism, which is defined in the statute."
1981.80-1594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.24,3118.507,Why?
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3119.94,3124.644,--Because there is more volition or voluntariness involved in the dealing in that case.
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.346,3132.733,But I thought you stressed the fact that this was voluntary as opposed to social security.
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3132.733,3158.732,"It is voluntary, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but in the final analysis, as everyone recognizes, for the medical protection that is involved, and given the objective of Congress, which was to assure starting in 1965 insurance against catastrophic medical expenses, there is no option available for most people other than the very wealthy."
1981.80-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3158.732,3162.419,"Well, so you say then it is voluntary or it is not voluntary?"
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3162.419,3177.012,"I say it is a voluntary act, but it has to be seen against the goals of Congress and the need which is being met, which... which makes it in a practical sense mixed, a mixture of actions, but--"
1981.80-1594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3177.012,3189.587,"As far as Erika was concerned, though, it presumably knew that the carrier would determine what reasonable charges are, and in that sense it got exactly what it expected the statute would get."
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3189.587,3199.959,"--No, it didn't, because what it bargained for in its relationship through its assignors was a reasonable charge determination in accordance with the statute."
1981.80-1594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3227.029,3239.352,"Well, I am aware of the claim, but it just seems to me that Erika realized when it undertook to enter into the relationship that these questions were going to be answered by the carrier, and took that risk."
1981.80-1594,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,3239.352,3251.144,"Well, it took a risk if the questions weren't... if the claims weren't paid accurately that some day a court might decide there was no recourse--"
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3529.391,3532.025,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1981.80-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3546.867,3556.642,"But Mr. Kneedler, isn't the quote right that there is a difference between this claim, where there is a voluntary decision by the beneficiary, and a Social Security Act claim, whereas this would be contractual and the other would not?"
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3556.642,3560.01,"--I think not, Mr. Justice Stevens, for several reasons."
1981.80-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3573.252,3574.354,"Well, but what about the 30 percent?"
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3574.354,3593.665,"Well, but there is no reason to think that Congress expected when it was enacting the Part B program with large... in large measure funded by... out of the general treasury that somehow Part B claims took on a different character than other sorts of social security benefits."
1981.80-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3593.665,3599.052,"Is he right that the beneficiary has to make a decision as to whether or not to participate, which is not true of social security?"
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3599.052,3600.571,"No, but I think... I think whether--"
1981.80-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3600.571,3601.371,That is right?
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3601.871,3602.387,"--Oh, that's true."
1981.80-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3615.931,3624.703,"--Well, would you contend that Fleming against Nestor would apply, that Congress, after collecting the money, could constitutionally say, we have decided not to... we just decided to welsh?"
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3624.703,3627.921,"--Well, I--"
1981.80-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3627.921,3630.273,We just call the program off.
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3637.327,3646.883,"--I'm not... I'm not so sure that it wouldn't, because Congress did not... as I say, there is nothing on the face of this to suggest that Congress believed it was entering into a contractual relationship."
1981.80-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3686.527,3696.316,"--But you, in order to win, you don't have to take the extreme position that the government could simply just say, we are not going to pay the--"
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3696.316,3697.749,"No, that is not... that is not involved in this--"
1981.80-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3697.749,3703.237,--But your position is that they have an adequate mechanism for determining whether or not there is any obligation in a particular case.
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3703.237,3703.437,--Yes.
1981.80-1594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3703.437,3707.022,And you have also... you say that he has also notified him in advance that--
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3707.022,3708.656,"Yes, absolutely, it is on the face of the Act."
1981.80-1594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3708.656,3711.492,"--that, by the way, friend, we are not waiving sovereign immunity."
1981.80-1594,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3711.492,3715.46,"Yes, and also the acceptance of assignments by Respondent was entirely voluntary here."
1981.80-1594,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3797.626,3798.544,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted."
