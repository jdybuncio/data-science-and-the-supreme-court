1983.82-1630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.288,We'll hear arguments next in Hudson against Palmer and the consolidated case.
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,63.954,69.377,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,319.752,322.754,"General Broaddus, can I ask you a question about the scope of your submission?"
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,322.754,324.233,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,324.233,331.189,As I understood your opening statement you were suggesting that the Fourth Amendment has no application to searches in the prison.
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,353.073,359.457,"Justice Stevens, with respect to the destruction of property aspect, that, of course, will be controlled by Parrat v. Taylor."
1983.82-1630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.703,407.168,"Mr. Broaddus, I suppose that if I am a policeman and you are a suspect I may have a probable cause that would justify my searching for and seizing a gold ring in your possession that is maybe worth $20,000, but the fact I may seize it in the Fourth Amendment sense does not justify me in keeping it."
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,407.168,410.25,That is correct.
1983.82-1630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.25,417.696,That is what you meant by the Parrat rather than Fourth Amendment being applicable to the property destruction?
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,417.696,418.165,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.537,563.262,"What if in a shakedown which you say is perfectly permissible, a random shakedown, suppose it is and the officer enters his cell and is searching around and he just picks up a radio and carries it out."
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,576.54,580.413,"We would take the position, Justice White, that it does not apply."
1983.82-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.777,587.686,"I know, but there was a seizure of it."
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,599.785,602.196,"--That is the allegation, yes, sir, which was--"
1983.82-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.196,605.258,At least it was seized.
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,623.018,623.95,--Under the Fourth Amendment--
1983.82-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.95,624.53,Is that right?
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,624.53,626.511,"--Under the Fourth Amendment, yes, sir, we would."
1983.82-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.208,639.801,But it certainly is a separate question from the search.
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,639.801,640.77,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.785,662.875,That may be.
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,666.027,666.948,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.948,676.776,But even on the search supposing you had a prison system whereby they censored all the incoming mail so it was all read before the prisoner was permitted to have it and he gets his mail.
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,679.45,687.394,There would be no Fourth Amendment prohibition in that situation.
1983.82-1630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.394,689.645,There would be no prohibition at all then would there?
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,689.645,705.256,"Well, if that were to constitute abuse then under the Virginia regulations which prohibit guards from abusing inmates the inmate would have redress under the inmate grievance procedure which has been approved by the Attorney General of the United States."
1983.82-1630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,712.239,725.469,"Just what remedies are available under state law in Virginia for redressing the property deprivations, just the grievance procedure?"
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,725.469,727.771,"Justice O'Connor, it would be far more than that."
1983.82-1630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,744.9,754.647,If the Court were to agree with your view is there any danger that a state might alter its grievance procedure--
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,754.647,755.699,I would certainly--
1983.82-1630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,755.699,759.893,--So that some of the same protections would not be available?
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,759.893,762.063,"--I would certainly think not, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-1630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,774.422,778.734,What is the remedy if he prevails in a grievance procedure?
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,778.734,790.011,--Under the grievance procedure he would be entitled either to recover the property and have it returned to him assuming it is still in existence or to be made whole through payment of the value of the property.
1983.82-1630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,795.434,796.496,Payments out of state funds?
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,796.496,797.497,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,803.391,809.055,Who is it that makes the final judgment in the grievance procedure?
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,809.055,836.3,"That ultimately goes up... It is a hierarchy level, if you will, sir, and depending upon the nature of the claim it may be the superintendent of the particular facility or it may be the regional superintendent who has control of many various facilities or it might be the deputy director of the overall Department of Corrections."
1983.82-1630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,845.587,847.189,Forgive my interrupting you again.
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,849.87,851.721,--Under the grievance procedure?
1983.82-1630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,851.721,852.282,Yes.
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,852.282,852.943,"That is correct, sir."
1983.82-1630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1289.12,1299.887,"What is the grievance procedure that was referred to, the procedure on which a prisoner can call for some kind of remedy?"
1983.82-1630,0,43854,william_g_broaddus,,1299.887,1309.163,"Mr. Chief Justice, at the time of this particular incident we had a grievance procedure in place which was similar to what is presently in place."
1983.82-1630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1349.529,1350.961,Very well.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1382.641,1385.513,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1409.439,1426.18,What would you say if in searching the locker or the cell of the prisoner they found a pistol or narcotics in an examination and seizure of these things without a warrant?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1427.38,1435.786,"I do not believe that under the analysis of search and seizures and prisons that a warrant is required, but I think we still might focus on the justification."
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1441.59,1444.441,Would it be admissible against him in evidence?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1444.441,1445.562,--The pistol?
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1453.126,1454.218,Would not be admissible?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1455.049,1455.658,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1458.009,1466.944,"How about heroin, 14 packages of heroin in small packages for delivery?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1466.944,1470.758,--I think all of that would be analyzed the same.
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1502.429,1507.674,What do you take the search to harass to mean?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1507.674,1512.516,A search for no legitimate purpose at all.
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.516,1515.027,Not looking for anything in effect?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1515.027,1515.888,That is correct.
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.304,1556.384,"Now there certainly is a middle ground between a system for searching, a prescribed set of rules, and the harassing search that you say is a search simply to no purpose whatever."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1565.861,1576.968,"--I believe if there is no legitimate purpose it would be analyzed as unreasonable, and I think in a prison situation we have obviously a very broad standard of reasonableness."
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.968,1583.643,Are harassing and no legitimate purpose equivalent in the way you are using the terms?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1583.643,1588.385,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.512,1619.446,So that is apart from any requirement that there be rules or anything else?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1628.352,1629.621,Absolutely.
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1760.978,1774.837,"I am not sure, Ms. Wyatt, I observe that in your cross petition you stated the question only in terms of the due process violation, not a Fourth Amendment."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1774.837,1777.1,"--That is correct, Your Honor, in my cross petition."
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.266,1901.549,"Is there not a difference between the facts in Screws and the facts here, though?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1901.549,1902.611,There is a difference.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.401,1906.612,"A different kind of deprivation, too, was it not?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1906.612,1908.024,--That was a life deprivation.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.024,1911.627,It was all completed before there was any possibility of a hearing.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1911.627,1915.667,"I think there could always be a wrongful death action, for example, in state court."
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1915.667,1920.322,"Well, would that make the person who suffered the deprivation of life whole?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,1923.885,1950.273,"I think our principles of tort law except the fiction that, for example, a suit for wrongful death does make that deprivation whole, but I certainly acknowledge that that is life and that when we are looking at a procedure whether we are talking about life, liberty or property may enter a Matthews v. Eldridge analysis because that is the weight of the particular interest at stake."
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1993.45,1996.392,"I am a little confused, Ms. Wyatt."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2015.394,2017.735,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.735,2036.358,"What is the source of authority for the court, any court, to lay down any regulations about random searches or any other kind of searches in a private law suit between a prisoner and a guard?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2036.358,2042.763,"Your Honor, I think that that points out a very important distinction in this case."
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.083,2065.686,Can the Fourth Amendment be violated by private parties?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2065.686,2069.948,"This is not a private party, Your Honor, and that is one thing that Screws and Monroe both made clear."
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2073.08,2075.553,I was taking you up on your statement that this was private.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2075.553,2077.224,--I did not mean to--
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2077.224,2078.505,A private suit.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2078.505,2081.578,"--I never meant to indicate it is a private party, Your Honor."
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.466,2118.271,Your claim has to be that the state acting through this guard deprived your client of his property without due process of law.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2125.657,2127.067,"Correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.633,2164.242,"I think the law on that is quite clear, but I think the Parrat case says the final judgment on the state's deprivation of due process is not to be pronounced solely on the basis of the action of a guard or a warden."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2173.496,2177.68,"--Your Honor, if this were a Parrat case I think the result would be the same."
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.793,2238.528,Do you think Parrat would have come out different if the two assistant wardens or guards in the mail room had been sued rather than the warden?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2238.528,2246.665,"--Parrat was a negligent case, and I believe if you sued an individual who had negligently lost property, and he said"
1983.82-1630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.212,2281.418,"Then to your mind the distinction really turns on negligence versus intent, not the superior versus the actual actor."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2281.418,2283.619,"Your Honor, I believe it is both."
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.768,2406.919,"Ms. Wyatt, on that very point is this locker in his cell?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2406.919,2408.481,Pardon me?
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.481,2411.162,The locker involved in this case.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2411.162,2412.113,Is that his cell?
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2412.113,2414.125,Was that in his cell?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2414.125,2416.666,"Your Honor, to be candid I was a little confused from the record."
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.163,2433.195,I have great problem with the search and seizure.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2443.073,2445.076,Your Honor--
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2445.076,2447.266,Would it have been a search and seizure?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2447.266,2453.19,"--If it were searched or seized for no legitimate purpose... Well, it would have been a search and seizure, yes."
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.042,2456.162,If he just picked it up off the bed?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2456.162,2457.384,--Yes.
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2457.384,2461.949,"That would be a search and a seizure, search and a seizure?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2461.949,2463.027,I am not sure if it would be a search.
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2465.26,2466.25,How could it be a search?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2468.019,2473.524,Is Your Honor talking about a plain view kind of exception then to a search a seizure?
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.953,2483.159,"I understand your complaint that the guard mistreated this man, but I do not understand where the search and seizure comes in."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2483.159,2486.622,--The allegations are--
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.622,2488.815,Your allegations do not help me.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2491.167,2503.696,"--My understanding from the record is that there is a locker and that the guard went into that locker and as the descriptions from the affidavits indicate ransacked the locker, went through the locker."
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2515.092,2516.294,The guard agrees to that?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2516.294,2522.408,"--The guard, of course, denied that, but we are here on summary judgment so for purposes of this case at this point that would be taken as true."
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.97,2542.131,The door could have been wide open.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2542.131,2547.597,"--It could have been wide open, and if the regulations allow the guard to go in there--"
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2547.597,2549.948,How can we decide what we do not know?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2549.948,2551.858,"--Your Honor, my--"
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.858,2560.243,Suppose I need to know to decide whether it is a search and seizure whether it was sitting out in plain view.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2560.243,2561.825,--The facts--
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.825,2569.199,There is nothing in this evidence of this case to show whether it was or was not in plain view.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2569.199,2573.693,--There has been no indication that it was in plain view from either side.
1983.82-1630,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2573.693,2575.613,Is that not open?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2576.985,2580.216,This was remanded on the issue of whether there could be--
1983.82-1630,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2580.216,2580.847,On the Fourth Amendment issue?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2580.847,2582.099,--On the Fourth Amendment issue.
1983.82-1630,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2582.099,2588.033,"The things that my brother was inquiring about, would they be open to proof at the hearing?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2588.033,2588.974,They certainly could be.
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2592.735,2595.829,"Is it or is it not, not could be."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2595.829,2605.914,"Your Honor, the Fourth Circuit remanded primarily on the issue of whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation under the guidelines it set forth, but there are many factual matters in dispute."
1983.82-1630,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2638.807,2651.346,Did you rely on Pape and Screws in the Court of Appeals on the issue you raised in your cross appeal?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2651.346,2654.0,I did not rely so strongly.
1983.82-1630,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2657.581,2660.512,I notice neither are cited nor addressed as I see it.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2660.512,2665.236,I believe Monroe v. Pape as I recall was cited.
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2669.178,2672.41,You relied on Screws?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2672.41,2673.572,I do not recall.
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2677.924,2685.269,I understand Screws to say that in order to deny a federal right you have to make it explicit that you are doing it for that purpose.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2685.269,2692.843,There is a willfulness requirement in Screws because of the criminal nature of that particular civil rights--
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2692.843,2694.866,"No, Screws says you have to say so."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2694.866,2696.807,--That the Civil Rights Act--
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.807,2710.714,Screws says if you are an officer and you are denying a prisoner or an individual his rights you have to make it clear that you are beating him up for the sole purpose of denying him his rights.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2710.714,2712.645,"--Your Honor, I believe--"
1983.82-1630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2712.645,2713.446,Is that not what Screws said?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2713.446,2716.288,--I believe we have Screws although it is not life.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.083,2759.458,Why is that fundamentally unfair if he will get paid at state court the same thing he will get paid at federal court?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2759.458,2762.44,Because there is something different that has happened.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.041,2786.135,But the injured party gets compensated in full under the hypothesis.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2788.906,2791.868,I am not sure what compensated in full means.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.045,2830.945,May I ask you another question about the Screws case?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2834.318,2840.052,I think that which makes my point most clear is obviously that of Justice Rutledge in concurrence.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.052,2843.524,Does he refer at all to deprivations of property in that opinion do you know?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2843.524,2844.125,No.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2904.863,2908.827,"Well, he cannot do that if you are right in your Fourth Amendment position."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2908.827,2912.109,--I think they are two entirely different guarantees.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.109,2913.188,Is that not right?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2916.521,2920.094,"If this is a seizure, no, he could not because we would have a constitutional violation."
1983.82-1630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2969.465,2970.477,Ms. Wyatt.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2970.477,2971.328,--Yes.
1983.82-1630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2971.328,2987.056,"I guess the Court held in Ingraham v. Wright that state court remedies were an adequate process for students subjected to corporal punishment in school, and that of course is even a liberty interest, not even a property interest."
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,2992.572,2999.175,"Justice O'Connor, I think that is a very important question because I read Ingraham a little bit differently."
1983.82-1630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3040.211,3048.489,"Well, might that not be true here, too, for a deprivation of property with state remedies that could be considered adequate?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3048.489,3052.4,--I think it would be if we were challenging the prison that allowed it.
1983.82-1630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3063.586,3069.81,You think Ingraham would have been a different result had one of the teachers who had administered the punishment were a defendant?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3069.81,3073.063,--I think it absolutely would have and should have been.
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3126.209,3128.73,"Counsel, may I ask a question about the facts?"
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3128.73,3129.361,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3129.361,3133.654,There was another guard or officer with Hudson at the time was there not?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3133.654,3136.175,"I am not aware of that, Your Honor."
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3136.175,3145.331,The affidavit from Mr. Hudson on page 14 of the appendix... Perhaps I am misreading it.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3145.331,3152.507,I do see where it says Officer Lephew.
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3152.507,3153.115,The third paragraph.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3153.115,3154.056,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3154.056,3157.499,Why was he not sued?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3157.499,3161.2,"Your Honor, again I was appointed at the Fourth Circuit level."
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3184.635,3188.068,Did you request an affidavit from this other officer also?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3188.068,3191.401,"--Your Honor, I was not involved at the District Court level."
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3191.401,3191.991,You were not involved?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3191.991,3192.622,"No, I was not."
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3194.333,3200.757,Does it suggest at all that there may be not have harassment if there were two of them there and one of them was not even sued?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3200.757,3207.892,"Your Honor, I believe his complaint goes on to give a number of instances of how this officer abused."
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3223.681,3225.655,You only sued on the one instance.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3225.655,3231.658,--He included a number of different harassment incidents.
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3231.658,3232.737,In his suit?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3232.737,3234.888,"In his suit, in his original suit."
1983.82-1630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3252.961,3257.535,He referred to the 16th and the 17th only I think.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3257.535,3259.145,"--Perhaps so, Your Honor."
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3268.12,3271.713,May I ask... You were appointed at the Fourth Circuit.
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3271.713,3272.194,That is correct.
1983.82-1630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.194,3274.425,Was he represented by counsel in the District Court?
1983.82-1630,1,21666,deborah_c_wyatt,,3274.425,3274.966,No.
1983.82-1630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3280.67,3284.493,"Do you have anything further, counsel?"
1983.82-1630,2,43854,william_g_broaddus,,3284.493,3287.314,Not unless the Court has questions.
1983.82-1630,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3287.314,3288.836,"Thank you, counsel."
