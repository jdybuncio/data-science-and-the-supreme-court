1998.98-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.798,"We'll hear argument next in Number... in 98-6, El Paso Natural Gas Company v. Laura Neztsosie."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,52.356,57.75,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,172.374,180.572,"I'm concerned, Mr. Atwood, frankly, with the procedural posture of this case."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,195.478,196.179,Correct.
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.179,198.282,But other claims could.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,198.282,200.555,"Claims under tribal law could, yes."
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.555,204.048,"All right, and then an appeal was taken to the Ninth Circuit."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,204.048,205.158,By petitioners.
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.158,215.005,"By you, by petitioners, and the Ninth Circuit decided a question that wasn't appealed."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,215.005,218.868,"As well as a question that was appealed, that's correct."
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.868,224.04,"Well, and it didn't decide other questions."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,235.87,236.271,No.
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.543,238.993,"I mean, I would think we would do that."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,238.993,253.274,--I... we agree the Court should vacate that portion of the court of appeals decision that allowed Price-Anderson cases to proceed in tribal court because in our view--
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.274,254.085,That wasn't appealed.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,254.085,255.467,--that issue was not appealed.
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.467,255.688,Right.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,255.688,256.346,That's correct.
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.844,270.998,"But the court, the Ninth Circuit didn't really deal with that, did it?"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,270.998,275.733,It affirmed the denial of a preliminary injunction that we requested.
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.993,289.654,I thought it really didn't get to the merits of that.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,289.654,292.195,"No, it... it decided two issues."
1998.98-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,313.628,322.066,"On the issue where the court of appeals reversed and it was not appealed, in a sense, it's not your fault."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,324.58,325.408,Right.
1998.98-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.408,339.188,"On the other hand, the court of appeals is in somewhat of a difficult position if it feels that the unappealed ruling and its rationale are logically necessary for its decision on the part that is appealed."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,341.16,357.581,"Well, there... I think there is a distinction between what orders were before the court and what orders are before this Court, and therefore what the relief should be, with the question of how broad the analysis needs to be to properly decide the issues that are before the Court."
1998.98-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.372,403.853,"Mr. Atwood, let me tell you my problem with that."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,488.192,488.192,"--Yes, the... right."
1998.98-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.192,508.517,"You cannot bring Price-Anderson claims in tribal court, then the question of whether a particular claim is Price-Anderson or not Price-Anderson never arises, and why should we sit here and deliberate on that question, and ask whether the tribal court can decide that question, and it must be exhausted, when it may well be a question that never arises?"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,508.517,517.102,"Well, there certainly are differences, though, substantively, in how a tribal law claim would proceed and how a Price-Anderson claim would proceed."
1998.98-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,519.244,521.264,What are... are you going to tell us what they are?
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,521.264,524.496,"--Yes, I'd be happy to."
1998.98-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,528.529,529.1,Yes.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,529.1,531.361,Which we don't think you can have.
1998.98-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,531.361,531.902,"Right, but assume--"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,531.902,540.628,"If there could be Price-Anderson claims in tribal court, again which we do not agree with, Federal standards of care would be relevant."
1998.98-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,548.341,554.866,--So you're saying that borrowing... borrowing in tribal law does not explain all that's going on.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,561.782,562.523,Not... no.
1998.98-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,567.118,568.55,So the issue--
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,568.55,571.051,"Arizona law would apply in tribal court, not tribal law."
1998.98-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.051,585.039,"--So the issue will arise in tribal court even if... even if Price-Anderson actions are allowable in tribal court, tribal courts will still have to decide whether a particular claim is Price-Anderson or not Price-Anderson?"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,585.039,593.094,"If Price-Anderson claims were properly held in tribal court, that would be a judgment the tribal court would have to reach."
1998.98-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,594.746,595.124,"Yes, I understand."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,595.124,596.907,"--do have authority, and we're not--"
1998.98-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.907,602.641,"I just don't want to decide something, you know, that may be irrelevant if Price-Anderson can be brought in tribal court."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,602.641,615.75,--And it may be that what is necessary because of the procedural errors of the Ninth Circuit... we're not opposed to this Court deciding all the substantive issues it feels it has an adequate record for.
1998.98-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.922,649.132,"Well, could the court of appeals have said, we're going to resolve the tribal claim issues, and in light of that resolution the district court must have been wrong in its injunction, assuming it came out that way."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,660.171,662.442,It is a preliminary injunction.
1998.98-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.442,663.504,"--the case for all time, if--"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,663.504,663.804,That's right.
1998.98-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.804,664.292,--the case at all.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,664.292,670.217,And respondents make the point that the issue would come back up to the court of appeals eventually on a permanent injunction.
1998.98-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.578,686.77,"Well, it may not come back."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,692.617,693.678,"Well, and also it depends on what the--"
1998.98-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.678,694.309,And on who wins.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,694.309,696.503,--And what the respondents want to do.
1998.98-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,767.564,781.893,"But they weren't passed on below, those... the argument that it's not Price-Anderson because it involves mining, and... or there's no indemnification in this picture, the Ninth Circuit didn't touch those."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,781.893,784.415,"In fact, the mining issue wasn't even raised with the Ninth Circuit."
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,786.908,791.501,"I'm... now, I thought I understood it, and now I realize I don't."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,798.646,799.147,Right.
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.147,814.374,"And it says, now, my relatives or others were killed, and... because of the nuclear waste, the nuclear mining, and we... we're entitled, as a result of negligence law, four other laws... and I don't think they mentioned Price-Anderson, did they?"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,814.374,814.905,They did not.
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.905,816.006,All right... they didn't even mention it.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,825.393,825.944,In part.
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,825.944,838.113,"Well, they denied it, and then he adds the words to the order, except insofar as the defendant seeks relief under the Price-Anderson Act in tribal court, which he hadn't done."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,853.393,854.524,"Well, I think what that--"
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.524,870.394,"And then it comes to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals goes into the discussion of whether or not a negligence claim is preempted, and whether you can assert whether it's preempted or not in the tribal court of the district court, the kind of issue that's been briefed here."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,885.395,885.625,--Right.
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,885.625,886.036,All right.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,888.407,890.899,"But Justice Breyer, I think there was an injunction issued--"
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,890.899,895.851,"Oh, it says except... yes, you're right, except to the extent the defendant seeks relief--"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,895.851,896.011,--Yes.
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,896.011,897.193,--under the Price-Anderson Act.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,897.193,902.839,"And we were required... we posted a bond, so all the elements of the normal preliminary injunction."
1998.98-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,912.433,912.593,All right.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,929.185,938.122,"Well, but... no, that leaves out a series of important errors that the court of appeals made with respect to the injunction that did not issue."
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,979.309,986.103,--But that's only if we assume that all their claims are preempted by Price-Anderson.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,986.103,994.448,"But... that's correct, but it is clear that on the face of what they allege, those are Price-Anderson claims."
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1000.001,1012.07,"But that gets us into all these issues about what Price-Anderson preempts, and whether it covers uranium mining at all, and these have not been decided by a lower court."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,1012.07,1013.131,"--Well, it is--"
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1013.131,1014.502,And all of a sudden you want--
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,1014.502,1014.682,--Yes.
1998.98-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1014.682,1015.924,--us to decide all of this.
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,1017.463,1031.042,"One option available to this Court is to tell the district court and the court of appeals, you should address the substance of the preemption argument, that your decision on exhaustion was wrong."
1998.98-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1048.204,1059.702,"Was there any suggestion or any possibility of interlocutory determination in the tribal court of the preemption issue, just as a matter of law, before the trial on the merits?"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,1059.702,1060.553,That was--
1998.98-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1060.553,1068.096,"In Strate there was actually a jurisdictional ruling all the way through the tribal system, and then the Federal courts--"
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,1068.096,1071.188,--It was not attempted in this case.
1998.98-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1096.817,1108.587,"--Mr. Atwood, as I understand it, what you are trying to do essentially is to make a substitute for the removal that Congress didn't provide with respect to tribes."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,1135.815,1137.988,It was... obviously the statute is silent.
1998.98-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1160.193,1173.633,"But with Farmers, that's at the end of the line, but the removal takes the case out of the State court and, indeed, there's a transfer provision if you bring it in any Federal court, other than the one where the site is."
1998.98-6,0,28880,james_r_atwood,,1173.633,1176.197,--Farmers says you can sue immediately in Federal court.
1998.98-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1221.289,1222.909,"Thank you, Mr. Atwood."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1225.363,1235.638,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1304.904,1322.865,"Well, respondents now put forward an argument that the personal injury claims under tribal law are not preempted, that in the case of uranium mining and where there is no indemnity, that that isn't the scheme."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1322.865,1324.107,--We disagree.
1998.98-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1324.107,1328.0,"Nobody has addressed that in the lower courts, presumably."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1328.0,1328.799,"That is correct, and we dis--"
1998.98-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1328.799,1329.23,In this case.
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1329.23,1330.021,--That is correct.
1998.98-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1358.391,1359.193,"Yes, but why isn't the--"
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1366.688,1381.927,"--One option this Court has is to reverse the Ninth Circuit on the threshold exhaustion issue, and to remand to the lower courts for a substantive determination as to whether respondents' claims in fact fall within the preemptive scope of the Price-Anderson Act."
1998.98-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1390.923,1421.033,"I was going to... you may have touched on what I was going to ask, but I'm not sure that I understand your argument for complete preemption, because I thought your argument for complete preemption was, Congress has clearly decided that these things ought to be resolved in Federal forums, and yet one of the issues before us, albeit one that was not passed on by the lower courts, was whether this particular... whether the claims here fall within the concept of public liability."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1436.563,1438.273,I disagree with that.
1998.98-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1454.656,1459.898,"Why didn't... if it's as simple as that, why didn't it simply provide for a broad removal provision?"
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1459.898,1463.662,"It did provide a removal provision for State courts, and it also--"
1998.98-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1463.662,1465.712,"Yes, but I mean, not for tribal courts."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1465.712,1486.786,"--That's correct, and it is probably the case that Congress was simply not thinking about tribal courts when it enacted this law, so the question then is, would it... would it violate congressional intent to permit Price-Anderson suits to persist in tribal court, despite what appears to be a clear statutory preference for having all Price-Anderson claims litigated in Federal court."
1998.98-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1486.786,1513.675,"Of course, if we... in answering that question, if we say, well, Congress is presumed to know the way, you know, the courts do business, I think your position would run up against this difficulty, and that is that the instances that you point to outside of Price-Anderson for the concept of what you call complete preemption in your brief were, I think... and correct me if I'm wrong... all instances in which there was an express removal provision."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1513.675,1524.63,"That's correct, but by enacting a complete preemption statute Congress signals its intent to have all litigation within a particular sphere to occur in Federal court and also--"
1998.98-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1524.63,1532.294,"Yes, but your examples of complete preemption prior to this case are all examples in which there is a removal provision, is that not correct?"
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1532.294,1540.642,"--But the point here is that there is no need for a removal provision, because everybody agrees the Federal courts have Federal question jurisdiction to address--"
1998.98-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1540.642,1543.054,"Sure, but that begs the question of exhaustion."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1543.054,1551.211,"--No, it doesn't beg the question of exhaustion, because again, the very process of exhausting tribal remedies in this context would frustrate this statutory scheme."
1998.98-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1568.332,1578.557,And you say this is the congressional intent without reference to this background set of cases that exemplify complete exhaustion under other statutory regimes.
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1583.001,1600.903,"--That conclusion clearly follows from the Price-Anderson Act, and you can tell that but not just from the enactment of a removal provision, but also from Congress' taking the extra step of deeming any action asserting public liability to be a claim arising within the scope of the Price-Anderson Act itself."
1998.98-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.903,1610.72,"Mr. Nuechterlein, is there any clue that Congress contemplated tribes at all, because when it talked about how the substantive law would be shaped, it mentioned State law."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1610.72,1612.67,That is correct.
1998.98-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1612.67,1616.674,"It provided for removal, but it seems that it just wasn't thinking about the tribes."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1616.674,1624.879,"That is correct, and it is significant that Congress provided that substantive State law would apply in Price-Anderson suits."
1998.98-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1700.559,1704.703,But you agree that that question should get a first view by a lower court.
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1704.703,1714.781,"I think that is one appropriate disposition, although the answer to the question is clear enough to us that I think that it would also be appropriate for this Court to decide it in the first instance."
1998.98-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1714.781,1725.106,"If we reverse on the ground that exhaustion is not required, what does the Ninth Circuit do with reference to the unappealed order?"
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1725.106,1751.934,"Well, that... that unappealed order would remain intact if this Court were to apply ordinary jurisdictional rules, so ultimately what might happen is, respondents would return to district court to claim that, notwithstanding any answer to the question of whether these claims fall within Price-Anderson, that a tribal court may nonetheless adjudicate Price-Anderson claims."
1998.98-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.409,1769.206,And what's the Government's position on the merits question of whether you can bring Price-Anderson claims in the tribal courts?
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1769.206,1783.295,"Our position is that it would be inconsistent with the whole point of the scheme to allow these suits to proceed over the objection of a defendant in tribal courts, because that would present exactly the same litigation problems that motivated Congress to enact the 1988 amendments."
1998.98-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1783.295,1786.208,"But absent objection, do they have jurisdiction?"
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1786.208,1791.12,"Yes, in the same way that State courts would have jurisdiction in the absence of an objection from the defendant."
1998.98-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.12,1792.953,What's the basis for the objection?
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1793.353,1795.284,The basis... it would--
1998.98-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.284,1798.106,--Sort of a cheap removal provision?
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1798.106,1799.776,"--Well, it's not a removal provision."
1998.98-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.776,1800.157,You just object to its presence there?
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1800.157,1808.995,It's taking advantage of this Court's holding in National Farmers Union that there is a Federal common law cause of action to challenge the jurisdiction of tribal courts.
1998.98-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.995,1813.868,"Well, I'm sure there is a cause of action to challenge it, but that doesn't say that there isn't any jurisdiction."
1998.98-6,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1818.782,1828.797,The cause of action would be that the exercise of jurisdiction over the objection of the defendant would be inconsistent with the structure of the Price-Anderson Act and therefore inconsistent with Federal law.
1998.98-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.797,1830.469,"Thank you, Mr. Nuechterlein."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1832.279,1839.996,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.127,1892.51,"By the decision below, you don't mean the unappealed order."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1892.991,1895.144,"I mean the entire decision below, in fact."
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.144,1895.552,--The entire... so... all right.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1895.552,1895.812,That's correct.
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.646,1933.78,"Well, you could avoid that at the other end of the spectrum, too."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1933.78,1935.218,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.218,1946.856,"I say, you could avoid running back and forth between tribal courts and Federal courts at the other end of the spectrum, too, and say that the... rule against your contentions in all respects."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1946.856,1973.944,"That would be true, but the fact is that the tribal exhaustion doctrine in its basic core element is intended to say, unless there is a clear lack of jurisdiction in the tribal courts, the idea is that the issues with respect to jurisdiction are considered first by the tribal court and then subsequently by the Federal court, and that's exactly the regime that the Ninth Circuit decision restores in this case."
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.9,2043.921,"Well, how could they?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2085.822,2088.864,"Justice Breyer, I think we have to look at two things."
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2124.457,2128.821,"No, what we have is a leak, you know, and there's a cloud, and it goes and hurts some people."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2128.821,2133.454,"--Right, but that I think would not be a case that's subject to tribal court jurisdiction, because in fact--"
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2133.454,2134.515,"Well, once you say that, what's the--"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2134.515,2138.488,"--The activity did not occur on the tribal reservation, so--"
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.488,2149.084,"--Well, what if they find there's a truck that goes through, the truck, and the truck leaks nuclear material, so... all I'm looking for is an example which clearly is within Price-Anderson."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2155.939,2156.928,"--I understand, but I think--"
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.928,2181.514,"Now, what reason could there possibly be that Congress would have wanted to take all those cases out of State court, which, by the way, are very used to dealing with all kinds of litigation, but nonetheless are brought into Federal court for consolidation purposes, and yet nonetheless Congress would have wanted to let those cases proliferate in the tribal courts."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2194.644,2196.826,--This is why I think the example does make a difference.
1998.98-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2226.545,2235.481,"Do you think, Mr. Farr, that was a deliberate decision by Congress not to allow removal from tribal courts, or do you think they just overlooked it at the time they enacted the removal statute?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2235.481,2238.714,"--In the Price-Anderson Act specifically, or generally?"
1998.98-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.714,2247.319,"Generally, because you make the general point that, unlike most plaintiffs, tribal plaintiffs don't have to worry about the defendant removing even if there's diversity jurisdiction."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2247.319,2247.77,That's right.
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.417,2292.572,"Which proves what, which proves that Congress did not... that Congress thought it was a bad idea?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2292.572,2294.141,--It doesn't necessarily prove that.
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2294.141,2294.452,It doesn't.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2294.452,2310.852,"What I'm suggesting, though, is that Congress seems, by not providing in any situation for removal from tribal court, in the end to be suggesting a special solicitude for tribal plaintiffs to choose tribal courts as their forum."
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.196,2331.806,So that's--
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2343.794,2344.064,That's correct.
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.099,2350.528,"Mining uranium, or--"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2350.528,2351.149,That's correct.
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2393.901,2409.081,"--Wait, I can put you on easier ground, I think, and I think you may have this... because suppose I thought... let's assume I do think this, which I think I do basically, that if Congress had a statute, that statute says, look, this is a certain kind of action, we do not want this ever brought in a State court."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2445.145,2446.988,"--Well, that's true, and--"
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.988,2449.178,And so what's your argument there?
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2475.256,2476.789,--That would still be in the tribal court.
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2476.789,2477.009,The SG disagrees with you.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2484.433,2486.576,"Well, I don't think it will, Your Honor, for several reasons."
1998.98-6,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2518.791,2523.833,"Well, that would be the same thing in a State court situation."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2533.801,2535.782,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-6,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2535.782,2539.715,"But Congress has said no, has provided for removal, right?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2539.715,2540.415,That's correct.
1998.98-6,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2540.415,2547.48,"And here, no similar language is included for removal from tribal courts."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2547.48,2547.85,Correct.
1998.98-6,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2547.85,2552.024,So we have to figure out what to do in the absence of such language.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2552.024,2569.635,"That's correct, but the point that I'm making, and back again to Justice Breyer's question, is that it seems to me instructive that the failure to provide for removal from tribal courts in this case is not an exception to the Congress' normal practice of providing for removal from tribal courts."
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.704,2600.166,We do have those cases.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2602.107,2602.958,Well--
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.958,2606.979,"We've done it in other areas, and you're saying it's shocking here."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2617.847,2619.557,"--No, I'm not arguing that there isn't a cause of action."
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2635.099,2642.274,"But don't make a comparison to how we treat State courts, because you couldn't have a 1331 action to yank a case out of a State court that way, could you?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2642.274,2654.111,"No, you could not, but what I'm suggesting, it's not a... it's not the difference between the way this Court treats State courts, it's the way the Congress treats removal from State courts and tribal courts."
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.404,2659.466,But the 1331 cause of action isn't yet filled in.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2672.897,2690.36,"Well, I think in a situation where it was clear that the tribal court did not have jurisdiction, that it would properly serve through a lawsuit brought under 1331 an injunctive power to bring the case, at least foreclose it in tribal court, if not bring it into Federal court."
1998.98-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.284,2728.686,"But, of course, the reason the tribal court lacks jurisdiction, if it does, is because Congress has said all these cases belong in Federal court."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2728.686,2734.302,"--Well, to begin with, Congress has not said that they all belong in Federal court as such."
1998.98-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.755,2737.415,If the defendant wants them there.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2737.415,2749.844,"--At most what Congress would have said is, if the defendant wants them there, and the point I'm making about the lack of provision for removal from tribal courts generally is that that's exactly what all removal statutes do."
1998.98-6,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2764.866,2765.277,Mr. Farr--
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2765.277,2766.286,--That's all they're pointing to here.
1998.98-6,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2766.286,2769.589,"--I think there is something different, and that's what I'd like to get down to."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2800.911,2801.361,That's correct.
1998.98-6,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2801.361,2820.012,"So if the question is, how sweeping is the Price-Anderson Act, does it cover mining, does it cover situations where there's no indemnification, why isn't it logical that a Federal court should decide that purely Federal question?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2858.888,2866.154,"I think the answer to that, Justice Goldburg, goes back to the basic idea why the exhaustion doctrine exists at all."
1998.98-6,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2892.31,2905.861,"But you can't get all the way there just from Farmers and LaPlante, because, as the Chief pointed out, those were decisions not... where we weren't guided by anything Congress said."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2908.762,2918.327,"I'm not saying that those decisions necessarily foreclose any evolution, essentially, in the 1331 cause of action."
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.94,2992.562,"But that wasn't appealed, was it?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2992.562,3006.88,"That was not appealed, and let me just say for one moment, I actually think that the court of appeals did have jurisdiction to consider the unappealed part of the order and to reverse that part."
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.718,3071.924,"Oh, but they're all categorical, whether it's based on jurisdiction or not."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3080.018,3087.464,"Well, to begin with, the case that deals with the issue most directly, Langes, is categorical the other way."
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.464,3088.934,Langes doesn't deal with the issue.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3101.153,3101.323,Right.
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.354,3104.615,"--So anything it said was dictum, and it has dictum on both sides."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3110.211,3115.063,"Well, but the question is, are they saying you can't do it because you lack the power to do so?"
1998.98-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3144.243,3145.794,"I don't know, but we've said so."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3146.795,3151.179,I don't think that one has said so as a matter of binding authority.
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3152.09,3154.582,"We have a case in point, like Morley."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3166.51,3169.264,"--Well, let me suggest two things if I may, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3193.438,3195.591,"Well, why not just cross-appeal when in doubt?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3195.591,3203.558,"--Well, that is a possible solution to the rule, but I think... in the first place I don't think litigants typically... for example, this case is not a bad example."
1998.98-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3219.307,3219.757,You said petitioners.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3220.678,3220.948,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.101,3249.38,Why do you care?
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3267.532,3267.942,"Well, I think--"
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3267.942,3268.403,So why do you care?
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3268.403,3272.026,"--Justice Breyer, I think there are two points, and I think it's important to keep them clear."
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3281.292,3281.732,You want to say even if they were.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3283.253,3283.504,--But may I make--
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3283.504,3283.944,Yes.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3283.944,3284.964,--just one final point.
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3313.273,3317.855,"Could you say one word on that, just what... I mean, I just don't want you to sit down without saying one other thing."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3377.491,3385.177,"I think there are two real problems... excuse me... with reading the language the way that that would, frankly, naturally seem to be read."
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3411.774,3416.087,"Public liability meaning liability to a human being, namely, a member of the public."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3416.087,3416.377,Right.
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3416.908,3417.649,"All right, so why don't we say that?"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3419.769,3426.164,--But it has to be public liability... the liability has to be on behalf of a defendant who is liable for public liability.
1998.98-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3426.164,3427.955,"Well, they're saying there is a defendant here."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3433.531,3448.27,"But the fact is, under the definition of persons indemnified, which is 2014(t), which includes all persons who are possibly liable for public liability, there has to be an indemnification agreement or financial protection where that doesn't apply."

1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3452.904,3458.268,"The... in general I think not, but the question is--"
1998.98-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3458.268,3460.679,"I understand your argument about the public liability action, but--"
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3460.679,3466.854,--Reading it in... the language as it moves through the definitions seems to lead to one conclusion.
1998.98-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3477.84,3480.724,--But you're saying that even if one assumes it's a nuclear incident.
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3480.724,3483.235,"--That would still be our position, right."

1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3537.238,3538.871,If it's jurisdictional at all--
1998.98-6,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3538.871,3547.807,"Even though it's a very intricate question of Federal statutory interpretation, and has no... that part of it has no tribal law element to it at all."
1998.98-6,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3547.807,3572.471,"--Regardless of the fact that it doesn't have a tribal court element, we still think that when a litigant goes into Federal court and says, stop the jurisdiction that is being exerted by this other court, that unless the lack of jurisdiction in that other court is clear both from jurisdictional and from substantive provisions, it is the role of the other court to make the initial determination about jurisdiction, and that's all we're asking here."
