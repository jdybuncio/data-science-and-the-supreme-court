2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.606,"We'll hear argument next in No. 05-204, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, and the consolidated cases."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,11.902,15.197,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,55.229,63.365,So your... your statement that it was for one reason only means it wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of race or ethnicity?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,63.365,71.424,"Your Honor, the finding of the district court, which we're relying on here, was that it was purely for discrimination based on partisanship rather than on the basis of race."
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.388,123.904,You think that's no good.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,123.904,124.778,"Your Honor, we--"
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.778,130.353,"Not... not even to prevent retrogression, which would violate section 5."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,130.353,136.82,"--Your Honor, the retrogression problem was created by the fact that they had gotten rid of a much more natural... naturally occurring--"
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.82,139.897,"But that was done for political reasons, not racial reasons."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,139.897,152.438,"--Exactly, Your Honor, and that's the argument that was made and rejected expressly by this Court in Bush v. Vera, that we had to make an ugly minority district rather than a compact minority district because if we did it the other way, a nearby incumbent would lose his seat."
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.994,173.556,But what... what is your proposal?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,198.404,211.462,I think the State has to stay within the constitutional confines of the Shaw v. Reno doctrine which would require it not to go so far in the pursuit of its political agenda that it creates a district... has to... has to create a minority opportunity district somewhere that would otherwise violate Shaw.
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,212.353,217.194,"But what's the... I'm... as Justice Scalia, I'm interested in the section 25 problem."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,218.116,219.084,--District.
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,219.084,224.721,"--for your cocounsel don't talk much about it, and it's... it's a problem for me."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,248.307,258.91,I don't think that it makes a constitutional difference under this Court's cases whether or not the reason they decided to place the district there and give it that configuration was because they had a political agenda somewhere else.
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.735,271.344,"Surely, that's not what makes it bad."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,296.569,304.018,"--Our point, Your Honor, is that in this situation, doing it this way, the... the motivation predominates over the other legitimate districting criteria, which I think under Bush and under--"
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,304.018,305.237,Which... which motivation?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,305.237,310.688,"--Well, the... the racial motivation to create a district... to... to reach out as far as they did to capture--"
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.688,329.398,"Well, can the... can the State by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in effect bootstrap itself in a position where it's entitled to use race where... in a... in a predominant and I... I think insulting way and... and then have a defense?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,329.398,331.258,"--Our submission is that they cannot, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,334.366,336.271,May I just clarify one thing on that?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,336.271,336.536,--Sure.
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,336.536,346.064,"I take it your reason was that in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they can use race to prevent retrogression."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,356.888,357.169,Yes.
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,357.169,358.231,--That's the... that's the argument.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,360.027,370.539,"Yes, Your Honor, and that they can't say we have to create it in a noncompact way where the race predominates over the other values because we have a political agenda of protecting some other incumbent in a nonminority district."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,370.539,383.829,"How... how does that make any sense to say that what you're objecting to is the consideration of race in one situation, but if it's compact and the predominant motive was the consideration of race, that doesn't bother you?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,397.058,400.26,"Well, Your Honor, I think there's a question of what you mean by the word predominance."
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,440.839,441.681,And that's a--
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,441.681,446.445,So you can take race into account if it's compact as a predominant motive.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,450.709,452.474,"I think, Your Honor, you certainly can--"
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,452.474,453.864,As a dominant motive.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,453.864,457.362,--You certainly can intentionally create a minority district under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
2005.05-204,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.563,465.311,May I ask?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,475.714,476.433,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.433,481.759,"And you don't agree that that necessarily makes it valid, that that's necessarily a defense to section 2."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,481.759,483.554,"No, I actually don't agree with that, Your Honor, and you're right."
2005.05-204,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.554,490.535,"And... and the problem with section... with district 23, under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, is not the motivation."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,492.815,493.753,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.753,502.108,And the question under the district court's opinion is whether the political motive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise be a violation of section 2.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,503.233,503.952,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,503.952,513.292,"Well, isn't it correct, though, that a result is... focus on results is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal protection one and not a section 2 one?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,513.292,518.212,"Right, but... but our challenge under the Equal Protection Clause--"
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.212,519.65,I'm talking about district 25.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,519.65,521.914,"--It's a little hard to keep all the different arguments straight, but yes."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,527.66,537.766,"Well, that's why I asked earlier that your... your statement that all of this was done with a political motive... I wondered how that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not the section 2 requirement."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,537.766,548.604,"--Well, I think there are situations in which you have a political motive overarching the entire map, and that... but at the same time, that pushes you to do some things which could violate the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of racial conduct."
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.276,551.478,--But you don't think that's a defense.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,557.398,558.429,"--That's correct, Your Honor, yes."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,560.023,570.237,"Now, with respect to section 2, what is... what is your position on the relationship between the predominant political motivation and the existence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,570.237,577.281,"Your Honor, if I understand the question, I... if the question is is it permissible to have--"
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,577.281,578.343,Let me put it another way.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,583.872,584.543,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.543,584.793,No.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,584.793,585.293,Certainly not.
2005.05-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,619.202,620.218,What about having a--
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.218,620.405,Wow.
2005.05-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,621.624,633.931,--What about having a... a plan that was put in place by the legislature instead of a temporary plan put in effect by a court?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,633.931,634.493,The--
2005.05-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,634.493,647.957,Isn't there... isn't it... you... you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting instead of as the very first redistricting done by a legislature.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,647.957,655.377,--It was the first one done by the legislature because they violated the constitutional intentionally when they had an obligation to... to draw a map 2 years earlier.
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.869,684.926,Which... but it's a perfectly constitutional basis to alter the map because we don't think it allocates the seats in the fashion that our political power enables us to... to provide for.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,698.654,699.436,"Your Honor, we--"
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.436,699.732,Don't you?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,699.732,708.728,"--we acknowledge that we tolerate political motivation in the context of map drawing when there's other legitimate public purposes being served, which is to say at the beginning of the decade when they have to redraw the map anyway."
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.728,709.041,I see.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,709.041,714.398,"But our position is when it's purely for partisan motivation, which is... only occurs in mid decade--"
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.398,737.811,"Even... even when the map is so... you... you acknowledge that the map that came out, after this... this realignment of districts, had less of a divergence between the voting strength of the Republican Party and the number of Republican seats than had existed under the previous allocation by the Democrats."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,737.811,740.808,"--That... that is not, we believe, a justification for two reasons, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.086,754.023,But I'm saying less.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,762.207,770.782,"Well, Your Honor, as the district court found... and this is on page 85 of our jurisdictional statement appendix... it wasn't that there was bias in the map that the court drew."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,797.896,799.834,"Well, counsel, just take it in... in an abstract way."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,817.124,819.059,My... my answers to that are twofold.
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,837.693,842.518,"Well, but let's get back to the... to the principle without just talking about these... these fact findings."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,885.657,887.391,"Well, Your Honor, I think that if the Court--"
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,887.391,889.749,I just don't understand that argument.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,889.749,898.34,"--I think it's a dangerous thing to do, to say to the legislatures of the country you can't redistrict for partisan gain, but if you can recouch it as partisan compensation, that's okay."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,898.34,899.667,Let me give you another parallel.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,910.975,916.567,"I think if a map is illegal, Your Honor, then... then certainly it is within the power of... of the legislature to--"
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.567,921.065,"Oh, well, that's... but now, in fairness, I think to the red brief argument... you've read the red briefs."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,921.065,921.893,"--I have, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,921.893,922.205,Yes.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,943.883,969.014,"My response is... is... factual response is that by the time we got to 2002, the district court's drawn map had 20 of 32 districts, which voted overwhelmingly Republican for every other office, in the range of 60 to 70 percent, so that whatever bias was introduced into the map in 1991, if there was one, had been eradicated because all of these Democrats in those districts had become more Republican."
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.779,976.481,"Now, what do I look to in the record to verify what you just said?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,976.481,984.32,You look to the court's finding on page 85 which said that 20 of 32 districts favored the Republicans.
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.852,1025.319,"Yes, but what percentage did they have?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1032.253,1037.877,The plan gave them 20 districts in which they had a strong Republican majority.
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.922,1042.406,"But you say that's what they should have had, given... given the voting in the State."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1042.406,1049.154,"--I say they... that given that opportunity to have 20 districts elect Congressmen, that's... that's all that anybody could reasonably ask for."
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.94,1094.464,Do you have any... any authority either in the text of the Constitution or in a... a case for the proposition that the only reason a legislature can reapportion its districts is because there's been a census?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1094.464,1097.228,Our... our position is slightly different.
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.228,1109.519,"Well, but that's your position when you said middecade redistricting is bad because your... your position is the only reason is the census is... has... has caused there to be less than... than one man/one vote."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1109.519,1113.376,"There may be cases where you could do middecade redistricting for neutral, legitimate public purposes."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1143.381,1145.224,But... but are you saying--
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1145.224,1164.451,"Well, if you say that middecennial districting is suspect or subject to some special rules, then it seems to me that you're... you're taking away a very important deterrent that works on legislatures when they do decennial districting."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1190.893,1192.236,"That... that might be a concern, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1217.85,1218.444,"Well, now, counsel--"
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.444,1220.069,That... that little... even if it's done by the court.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1247.322,1259.428,"--The... the reason I... I slipped it in is that in my description of what I think is the current tradition, Your Honor, is we went and looked and found how many court drawn congressional district maps have there been in this country in the last 40 years, and how many times were they redrawn by the legislature."
2005.05-204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.016,1274.187,"Well, I'd say that's a shame for the democratic process."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1283.277,1291.384,"--Well, Your Honor, the other thing I think about this... this argument about that we have this... this need to have a legislative plan is you invite an abuse of a different kind."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1306.002,1311.219,"--Is that the reason these lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the decade, because the majority party sat on its hands?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1311.219,1312.546,"--That's absolutely what happened here, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1315.435,1315.763,I thought there was--
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.763,1316.169,I thought--
2005.05-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1316.169,1318.294,--I thought there... the houses were divided.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1324.276,1332.289,--The reality is... and the record... there was discussion of this at trial by Senator Ratliffe... there was not very serious effort to do this at the time.
2005.05-204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1350.687,1360.37,"--But the court... even from the court's perspective, was it the same three judges that did the... that did the plan, the court ordered plan?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1379.551,1382.144,"--Well, Your Honor, there was some language to that effect."
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1432.857,1436.323,"Well, we're not... we're not trying the court for a bad intent."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1460.205,1463.344,"--But, Your Honor, the facts are that it wasn't slanted."

2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1570.598,1571.348,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1571.348,1589.169,"And yet, I take it it's also your position that if the districting is done in response to the new decennial figures so that there's a need to do something to conform to one person/one vote, that there is nothing illegitimate about political motivation, at least up to some point--"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1589.169,1589.653,Right.
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1589.653,1592.448,--in... in drawing the lines at that time.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1606.568,1610.864,It seems to me that one is not saying that it's legitimate in 1991.
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1647.567,1661.952,"But you're making the assumption that a mid decennial districting is not interested in compactness, it's not interested in counties, it's not interested in keeping a university within one... within one district."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1664.202,1669.98,"Well, Your Honor, the... the fact here is that the only reason they decided to change was for partisanship."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1699.765,1715.445,"But your answer, both to the Justice Kennedy and... and to me, ultimately comes down, I guess, to saying that political partisanship alone, undiluted, unadulterated by any other motivations, is per se wrong."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1715.445,1719.491,"It's... it's not a basis that can justify public conduct, State action."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1728.597,1728.879,All right.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1761.631,1767.893,"The question I think you need to pose is what is the justification for doing anything, not... not for any particular line--"
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1767.893,1770.83,"Well, that may be, but how about the question that I posed?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1771.127,1774.188,"--Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that if... if the... I was trying to get to the answer."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1774.767,1775.157,Okay.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1775.157,1790.355,"It seems to me that if... if you can... if they can legitimately and... and plausibly say, we are... we... we decided to redraw the old map because it was so departed... it's so departed from these important principles and values like compactness and respect for subdivision... so if that's our reason--"
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1790.355,1790.605,No.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1800.741,1801.552,"--I think so, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1816.546,1821.592,The difficulty I have with that is that it is... it is impossible... I think you would agree.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1845.253,1850.377,"Well, Your Honor, our... our submission is it makes a difference when it's pure rather than merely one of the many things that is going on."

2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1858.717,1858.921,--Sure.
2005.05-204,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.921,1862.247,You've mainly attacked the plan as a whole in your briefs.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1871.384,1875.741,"We have plaintiffs in every district, I think, on the whole map, certainly any district that would raise a concern under--"
2005.05-204,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.741,1877.476,But they're not identified easily--
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1877.476,1890.236,"--Yes, Your Honor, but... but I think that there... there was a... in the complaint there's allegations about where each of these people live, and I think that... that we were very careful to make sure anything we were talking about specifically, such as, for example, district 24 in Dallas, we had... we had plaintiffs."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1938.419,1942.589,--What was the percentage of the African American voters in the district as a whole?

2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1962.238,1982.65,"So that if you had a situation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent another group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent controlled who was elected by siding with one group or the other group, then you would say that that was an influence district for that small... the smallest group in the district?"
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1982.65,1991.959,"--Your Honor, I don't think that would work because I think the way we... we view what you have... you... the group has to be able to decide who's going to be on the ballot, and then you want to see whether there's enough crossover voting to--"
2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1991.959,1992.209,No.

2005.05-204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.754,2002.082,Accept the hypothetical.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,2002.082,2002.441,--Yes.
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.609,2010.328,What is the answer?
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,2020.651,2021.167,--Yes.
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.167,2021.823,A lot.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,2044.516,2052.42,I think there are a number of limiting principles that apply here that... that suggest we're not just coming in here and asking for the Voting Rights Act to become the... the proDemocratic act--
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.42,2054.091,Obviously you're not.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,2055.263,2055.746,--And... and--
2005.05-204,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2055.746,2058.902,--you to say what specifically the answer to that argument is.
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,2058.902,2071.647,"--The... the... first of all, there are not that many districts in which African Americans control the Democratic primary and then have predictable ability to see that person elected in... in the general election."
2005.05-204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2117.566,2128.311,"This would be at... least your criterion, whether we accept it or not, would... would be more administrable if we're dealing with the elimination of a district than if we were dealing with the question of creating one."
2005.05-204,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,2139.354,2154.16,"I... I perhaps more faith in the ability of courts to predict the future than... than that brief does, but... but I certainly can imagine a rule where the court says, we're going to require that there be experience, not simply predictions by experts, in order to create a district below the majority level."
2005.05-204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.937,2164.187,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2178.354,2181.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.05-204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.792,2217.198,In 23.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2217.198,2219.151,"In district 23, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2230.676,2237.377,"Focus for a minute just on the... what we can call the removal, the drawing of the lines to exclude some Latino voters."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2250.528,2254.074,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do attack that finding as clearly erroneous."
2005.05-204,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.457,2275.221,May I interrupt you just with one... one question on district 23?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2286.592,2289.044,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
2005.05-204,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.105,2297.869,"So that even if the intent was primarily political, it would still violate section 2."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2297.869,2301.462,"--Yes, and we argue in our brief exactly that."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2392.641,2396.75,Does that undermine the assumption that there's... they're voting as a bloc?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2402.06,2405.2,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.15,2455.21,I don't understand.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2485.479,2494.945,"This Court made clear in Bush v. Vera that the State may not make exactly the kind of assumption, Justice Scalia, that you described."
2005.05-204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2505.753,2512.5,"Well, but... but that was because it was deliberate in that case, and that's not the hypothetical that Justice Scalia has posed."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2512.5,2523.729,"--In this case, we contend that the State removed Latino voters from district 23 because they were Latino and that--"
2005.05-204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2523.729,2527.119,But that's not the hypothetical that was posed to you by the Justice.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2527.119,2529.165,--That if the State--
2005.05-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2529.165,2529.806,I'm assuming--
2005.05-204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2529.806,2531.165,As I... as I understood it.
2005.05-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.165,2533.742,"--they're removing them because they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2533.742,2542.988,"--Then it is still wrong to take out 100,000 Latinos using that assumption."
2005.05-204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2559.997,2564.463,But is it... is it wrong under the Equal Protection Clause or is it wrong under section 2?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2564.463,2568.008,"It's wrong under both, we would argue in our brief."
2005.05-204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2568.008,2568.336,No.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2598.778,2612.163,"We contend that in this case the removal is invidious because it was Latinos that were identified and taken out and then... for incumbency protection, similar to what--"
2005.05-204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2612.163,2616.692,"Well, is that because there were no other Democrats who could have been identified and taken out?"
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2616.692,2624.205,--There's no testimony that the State considered ever taking out anybody else but the people in Webb County.
2005.05-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2624.205,2629.39,I thought you said that the county was 92 percent Latino or something like that.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2629.39,2630.53,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.53,2636.513,"Well, how can you... how can you possibly take out any substantial number of Democrats without taking out Latinos?"
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2636.513,2639.245,"That's exactly our point, that the State removed--"
2005.05-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.245,2639.948,"Well, that's my point too."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2640.76,2646.492,--Moving to what I... the point--
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2646.492,2650.632,Can I... can I... I don't understand... I think your argument is at cross purposes.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2672.825,2680.463,"--I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, but under the facts of this case, what had happened by 2002 was something very, very different."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2688.632,2690.272,"Yes, the percentage goes up, the percentage goes down."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2690.272,2690.521,--Yes.
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2690.521,2691.911,It depends on who's running against him.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2714.387,2726.381,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, because this is bloc voting at rates of 70 percent or higher, and after 1996, that 70 percent bloc went to 80 percent and then it went to 90 percent."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2758.386,2760.884,"Well, then... well, but then... and this is why I say it's an argument at cross purposes."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2770.426,2776.424,"We would contend, Mr. Chief Justice, that voting against Congressman Bonilla doesn't make you a Democrat."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2811.851,2813.662,"It's not just the State that's saying it, though."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2827.952,2839.182,"We agree, Mr. Chief Justice, that the end goal was political in the sense of incumbency protection, but a State may not use race as the means to the end of protecting an incumbent."
2005.05-204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2857.361,2862.36,"Well, can... can the State use race as the means to an end of electing a new candidate that the race wants?"
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2864.328,2866.906,It should turn on the candidate of choice--
2005.05-204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2866.906,2877.651,"I mean, it sounds like you're going to say race cannot be used as this basis, but how can race be used not to protect an incumbent but to allow the group to choose the representative of its choice and then reelect him every year?"
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2877.651,2882.337,"--Well, district 23 was created by the Balderas court pursuant to a finding under section 2."
2005.05-204,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2917.026,2923.321,"Well, if... if the objective is just to get rid of the voters who vote against Congressman Bonilla, why is that an equal protection violation?"
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2929.427,2933.957,Because the group of voters who had withdrawn their support were Latino voters.
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2987.215,2989.574,Is that... and what relevance does that have?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,2998.367,3000.336,"--The Fourteenth Amendment, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3000.336,3006.646,"That's what the Fourteenth Amendment was passed for, to avoid creating the impression that a particular group supports a particular candidate?"
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3006.646,3024.606,"--This Court has held that race may not be used for its own sake in redistricting, and here race was used most gratuitously and cynically to make sure that the State could say a majority of Latinos in district 23 support Congressman Bonilla."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3041.303,3051.768,And how many... what percentage would they have shifted from making it look like a Hispanic opportunity district with about 51 percent to when it would actually be one?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3056.828,3059.859,"--Oh, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but... but quite a distance."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3061.169,3061.982,But what's the number?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3061.982,3070.619,"--The voting age population for district 23, as created by the Balderas court, Your Honor, was a great deal higher."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.305,3076.586,Is that your number?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3096.687,3107.572,"--We would argue that race cannot be used for its own sake, that if you're going to put people together into a Latino majority district, it should be to meet a purpose, for example, to create an opportunity district under the Voting Rights Act."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3107.572,3108.572,What's the number?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3108.572,3114.82,"That would be... well, depending on how many people it takes in that particular district to elect a candidate of choice."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.584,3125.128,"So if this district were drawn with 60 percent, you would say that's just to make it look like a Hispanic district?"
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3125.128,3126.831,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3126.831,3127.175,No.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3137.875,3152.165,"Maybe I can answer the question by going around to the court's finding, which was that district 23 was created not as a Latino opportunity district, that it would not operate to offer the opportunity to elect a Latino for a candidate."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3165.364,3166.722,I'm just trying to get the number.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3175.375,3180.405,That number would be the number that shows Latinos have the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice.
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.091,3222.075,Would it have been better--
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3222.075,3222.684,--to have done that.
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3222.684,3228.868,--would it have been better in your view if they had excluded more Hispanics so it didn't look like a Hispanic opportunity district?
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3228.868,3234.819,"Well, the State certainly could have moved Webb County whole out of the district."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3237.756,3238.771,And... and that would have been preferable.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3245.924,3249.985,"--Mr. Chief Justice, it... it just doesn't hang on a particular number."
2005.05-204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3277.302,3288.298,"Well, isn't... isn't one answer that we were doing it, number one, because we wanted to protect the incumbent and we also had to use race to avoid a section 5 problem and a section 2 claim?"
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3290.594,3304.042,"Well, under section 5, the State went ahead and created district 25 as the offset because it seemed fairly clear that district 23 had been dismantled to such a degree it was no longer going to be able to be used for section 5 purposes."
2005.05-204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3322.659,3334.56,"So you could have used that reasoning to create a district in the first place, but you cannot use that reasoning to create an offset district in the second place at the same time that you're trying to protect an incumbent."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3336.762,3346.243,"To create a district with 50.9 percent voting age population here in this part of the State, it would be obvious that you weren't going to yield an opportunity district."
2005.05-204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3346.243,3351.445,"In other words, you're saying that would be implausible as a section 2/section 5 justification, regardless of when you're doing it."
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3351.883,3352.287,Yes.
2005.05-204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3352.287,3352.694,--Yes.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3352.694,3353.991,"Yes, most certainly."
2005.05-204,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3378.747,3383.65,"But, of course, you want them to use race to manipulate outcomes."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3385.868,3387.415,You may answer.
2005.05-204,1,37251,nina_perales,,3387.415,3389.445,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3396.037,3398.082,"Thank you, Ms. Perales."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3408.079,3411.185,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3446.236,3453.2,"But may I ask, General Cruz, are you talking about replacing the court-ordered map or the preceding Democrat gerrymandered map?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3453.2,3468.694,"--The legislature replaced the court-ordered map, but the court found as a factual matter that the court-ordered map, in the court's words, quote, perpetuated the 1991 Democratic Party gerrymander, and that was the court characterizing its own map with the same judges."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3468.694,3473.708,"Yes, but you don't think it really perpetuated the same degree of gerrymandering that was present in the earlier map, do you?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3473.708,3475.255,"Well, the court's map, under the--"
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3475.255,3476.253,I'm asking you.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3476.253,3476.566,--Yes.
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3476.566,3477.253,Do you think it did?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3477.831,3478.394,"Yes, we do."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3478.394,3480.58,--the court-ordered map is just as bad as the Democratic map?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3480.58,3489.358,"The district court found that it had blunted some of the most egregious lines, but under the district court's map, 28 of 28 incumbents were reelected."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.824,3499.245,"But is your opponent correct in saying that in six of those districts, the Democrat won even though the district was majority Republican?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3499.245,3501.602,"That... that is correct, and then the district court--"
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.602,3503.758,Does that sound like a gerrymander?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3503.758,3505.555,--It... it depends.
2005.05-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3516.972,3518.315,No.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3536.666,3538.149,--And that's exactly right.
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3624.693,3625.021,All right.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3674.61,3693.29,"--Justice Breyer, under the standard articulated in your opinion in Vieth, in our judgment the result would be a straightforward affirmance here because the map that was adopted is precisely what was advocated in Vieth of a majority of the population electing a majority of the delegation."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3751.501,3753.204,May I ask you this question?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3766.464,3771.337,"Of course, it does not, and there are a variety of district-specific attacks."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3777.802,3778.209,I understand.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3778.209,3796.764,"--and the reason for that is that in the Vieth decision, Justice Kennedy's concurrence was the controlling concurrence, and it set out a standard for subsequent partisan gerrymandering cases that litigants should find a, quote, substantive definition of fairness in districting that commands general assent."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3811.883,3829.969,"And the... the next question I wanted to ask you is that if it is possible there can be a single-district challenge, what is the justification for the... the cracking of district 24, which was a majority Democratic district before, into five different districts, none of which would elect a Democrat."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3829.969,3834.467,"The legislature made a policy judgment, and under the decision--"
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3834.467,3838.778,But is it... is it defended by anything other than political motivation?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3838.778,3841.762,--There were a host of--
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3841.762,3843.339,I mean in district 24.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3843.339,3856.926,"--There were a host of judgments about the multiple districts that district 24 was broken into, and the district court found, for example, that Representative Grusendorf wanted the City of Arlington contained in one single district."
2005.05-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4025.717,4029.045,A... a minority who was a majority.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4029.045,4030.967,"Indeed, yes."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4089.708,4092.036,"General Cruz, could I ask you another district-specific question?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4115.884,4121.273,"As the hypothetical is... is asked, the answer would be no."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4128.785,4129.519,Not a defense.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4147.09,4149.871,The Court has concluded before--
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4149.871,4152.212,Given what the Court said in Shaw II.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4152.212,4159.162,"--Right, right, that... that a... a section 2 violation in one area cannot be corrected with a discrete change in a different area."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4159.162,4159.631,Right.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4159.631,4168.426,"However, in De Grandy, the Court also said that the assessment is the totality of circumstances in the region under-assessed."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4189.151,4192.603,Except for the fact the district court really didn't find a violation in section 2.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4207.801,4210.253,--If they are wholly different areas--
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4210.253,4210.643,Yes.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4210.643,4211.502,--the Court has concluded no.
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4211.502,4211.83,Yes.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4211.83,4213.064,If they are--
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4213.064,4218.812,So the argument... the question then would be whether district 25 is a wholly different area from district 23.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4218.812,4220.56,--That's correct.
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4220.56,4222.701,And what do we look at to determine that?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4240.022,4248.846,"They are not that relatively close together, but... but that is because this region of Texas is... is vast and... and relatively lightly populated."
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4294.671,4300.466,But I didn't understand Ms. Perales' argument to concern section... district 25 at all.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4300.466,4308.729,"--It did not, and... and, indeed, she has never joined in the racial gerrymandering claim that has been brought by the... by the Jackson plaintiffs."
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4329.907,4345.963,"Would a... I'd like you to elaborate a little because, as I understood your claim, particularly in response to Justice Stevens, you agree that if 23 violated section 2, they can't make up for it somewhere else."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4357.896,4358.677,That's correct.
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4358.677,4362.41,"And the reason that it didn't violate section 2, I want to know, is what?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4383.168,4385.183,"There are multiple reasons, Justice Breyer."
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4404.033,4405.143,And why was that?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4405.143,4412.515,Because the... the data demonstrated that a majority of Hispanic voters were not able to elect their candidate of choice.
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4423.135,4426.791,But isn't that somewhat inconsistent with the decision to reshape the district?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4428.556,4444.237,"What the legislature did... the legislature's express intention was to shore up Congressman Bonilla's electoral chances, and... and it was explicitly because Congressman Bonilla is a valued member of the delegation and the legislature made a judgment that they wanted to increase his margin of victory."
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4445.344,4462.448,"And... and in your view, that justification allows the creation of district 25, which has, as far as Latino population, people of quite different economic backgrounds and so forth, you know, the... the two-ended... the district on the two ends."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4462.448,4463.385,--We did not--
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4463.385,4470.007,"That... that to me was... was not discussed much in your brief, but it's a serious Shaw violation."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4481.158,4491.404,"--We did not place our principal emphasis, with respect to 25, on the Voting Rights Act's concerns potentially raised by the alterations in 23."
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4508.101,4515.411,Do you have a... a section 5 argument with respect to district 25 as opposed to a section 2 argument involving district 23?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4515.411,4539.619,"--The legislature was certainly concerned about section 5, and with respect to the adjustment in... in district 23, it was possible that the Department of Justice might deem the alteration of district 23 to be something that would be retrogressive and, accordingly, having a district that was... a performing Hispanic opportunity district would increase the chances of preclearance."
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4550.6,4558.314,Is it permissible for a legislature concerned with section 5 to take race and ethnicity in account... into account in drawing a district?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4558.314,4561.844,This Court has never squarely resolved that.
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4584.741,4598.674,"And as to 23, do you want this Court to say that it's constitutionally permissible to take away a number of minority voters from the district, but leave just enough so that it looks like a minority?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4604.187,4611.59,Except the district court found as a factual matter that what happened in district 23 was wholly political.
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4616.619,4622.087,"Well, but... but the additional finding is that 50 percent were kept to make it... to make it look good."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4622.087,4631.348,"The... the legislature was aware of... as this Court has said, the legislature will always be aware of the racial composition of a district."
2005.05-204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4690.104,4691.354,Why... in... in--
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4691.354,4692.401,Go ahead.
2005.05-204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4693.197,4704.741,"--In... in contrast to that, however, you could not make that argument or... or that response with respect to... to district 24, the district in which the... the black vote was... was cracked."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4723.419,4728.278,"Well, as you know, Justice Souter, purpose under the '82 amendment is irrelevant to section 2."
2005.05-204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4774.962,4787.456,"But... but following Georgia and Ashcroft, isn't... isn't that a possibility that we should consider as a satisfaction of what has come to be known as the... you know, the first of... of the Gingles factors?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4787.456,4796.11,"In our judgment, Georgia against Ashcroft expanded the flexibility for States to determine how to comply with the Voting Rights Act."
2005.05-204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4825.207,4836.921,"But it... it is not inconsistent with Georgia and Ashcroft to say that for... for much the same reason, States have less flexibility in cracking influence districts once they have been established."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,4836.921,4856.305,"That might perhaps be true if the plaintiffs could demonstrate the other Gingles prongs, but on the second and third prong, the district court found that African American voter cohesion was far from clear and there was absolutely no cohesion between African Americans and Hispanics in district 24."
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5017.943,5023.002,"Counsel, can I move you south and west again, back to district 23?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5052.96,5061.878,The district court made a finding that the reason district 23 was altered was to increase the chances of Congressman Bonilla prevailing.
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5202.586,5205.569,"Well, of course, the reason the lines are straight is nobody is there."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5206.256,5212.02,But those counties have to be placed in some district.
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5388.354,5409.987,"General Cruz, if you've finished your answer... I didn't want to interrupt you, but that makes... reminds me of a question I wanted to answer you because... ask you, rather, because you make a very persuasive argument in your brief, which I found very helpful, that the... a State should be able to correct a prior gerrymander by... for... with political motivations."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5427.651,5435.07,"That could be a salutary policy goal, and... and Congress could certainly enact that."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5441.568,5455.218,"We have... we have quite a history, as you just identified in your response to Justice Kennedy, of being concerned about particularly grotesque shapes, and that's why they developed these tests of compactness for use in this very litigation."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5463.308,5468.494,"--At an extreme level, lack of compactness can indicate something was going on."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5486.191,5490.11,"When I... when I was thinking about this problem, I looked at district 24."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5504.558,5506.87,The... the new map--
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5506.87,5507.447,Which it seems to me quite significant.

2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5513.149,5518.334,And its particularly... particular reference to the targeted group that was moved out of the district.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5518.334,5531.358,"--But lack of compactness does not... no one has brought a racial gerrymandering claim with respect to districts other than 25 and, to some extent, 23, although the 23 challenge is not a typical racial gerrymandering claim."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5531.358,5534.639,"No, but I'm suggesting the challenge to 24 should be a political gerrymandering challenge."

2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5553.242,5554.74,And that's the standard I'm suggesting.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5556.474,5557.755,But--
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5557.755,5558.958,--The compactness standard.
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5558.958,5560.036,Yes.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5560.036,5566.596,"--But the Court had before it... appellants urged in Vieth compactness, principles of cracking, principles of packing."
2005.05-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5579.433,5583.292,I'm not sure that Justice Stevens is suggesting that as a standard.
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5596.427,5598.208,No.
2005.05-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5601.222,5604.643,A safe harbor from an unknown standard.
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5606.126,5608.078,Jump in whenever you want.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5608.719,5629.726,"Under any standard that looks to the substantive lines on the map, anything that... and we have spent hours racking our brains trying to think of a standard for litigation purposes that would yield the old map being more fair than the new one."
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5632.724,5634.817,Let... let me ask you this.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5666.835,5675.894,"Well, that... that question actually was litigated in this case, the first time in 2001, as part of the litigation over how to draw the new map."
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5700.837,5721.001,"Well, but my hypothetical is designed to suggest that partisanship, political lines should be certainly a secondary consideration to a valid principled scheme and that perhaps in the hypothetical case, you could reverse a district court for abuse of discretion in... in overemphasizing political considerations."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5730.873,5746.507,"In this case, the district court was presented with maps that would be more fair on... on pretty much any measure of partisanship, and what the district court concluded is it didn't have the ability... that making that judgment was a political judgment, and it was the legislature's job to do it."
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5783.491,5789.021,What... district 24.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5825.803,5828.161,"Justice Breyer, that's... that's exactly correct--"
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5828.161,5831.753,"Then... then if I... if I... so I have to go back, look at the record, and see what it says."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5870.394,5874.157,"--Well, although we would submit this district is reasonably compact."
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5874.157,5875.501,"Yes, so I understand that."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5896.134,5907.394,"Justice Breyer, you're correct that if the Court concludes this district is not reasonably compact, then under its precedents, it wouldn't be a narrowly tailored way to satisfy a voting rights violation, but--"
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5907.394,5912.767,And is there anything I can look to to decide what reasonably compact means in that second--
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5912.767,5927.089,"--Well, the district court's finding was that Texas geography and population dispersion limit the availability of district compactness in southern and western regions of the State, and that was at the Jackson jurisdictional statement, page 154a."
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5929.495,5931.401,You're talking about district 25.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5931.745,5932.338,"--25, yes."
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5933.79,5934.634,"--Yes, 25."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5934.634,5939.553,"25 has seven whole counties and only two county splits, which is unusual."
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5983.395,5990.626,"--General Cruz, why wouldn't it be a... at least a helpful guide to what is reasonably compact to compare with the preceding districts?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,5997.576,6005.949,"One could certainly compare the preceding district, and with respect to the preceding district, the differential is... is not great."
2005.05-204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,6010.149,6015.648,"When you're carved out of a couple of preceding districts, which is the preceding district?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6018.117,6020.178,--That... that is a certainly a challenge.
2005.05-204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6020.178,6023.114,"I suppose if you have a plaintiff suing, it would be the one he lives in."
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6023.114,6031.562,"You know, if you compare, for example, district 25's perimeter-to-area score is 9.6."
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6074.592,6077.715,Why did they have... why did have just 50.3 percent?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6077.715,6082.558,--Because the Hispanic population is dispersed enough that one can't... one can't draw--
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6082.558,6085.807,They're doing that to make it look like whoever was elected had Hispanic support in that district?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6086.571,6089.009,--We did not ascribe motives to them.
2005.05-204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6102.738,6109.079,On the... either it is reasonably compact or it isn't.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6121.557,6130.991,"Correct, but with respect to the question of racial gerrymandering, this Court's question is, is race the predominant motivation?"
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,6153.093,6158.058,You mean 25... the... the Latino makeup of 25 is accidental?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6158.058,6162.072,It is a function of the population in south and west Texas.
2005.05-204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,6162.072,6162.869,It's accidental.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6162.869,6172.146,"The... it is not accidental in the sense that the legislature was unaware, and as this Court has said, whenever a legislature is districting, it is aware of the... the racial distribution."
2005.05-204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,6187.844,6202.587,"What... what do you say to Ms. Perales' argument that the... the numbers are just too precise to have been reflective of anything but a racial motivation, and that, therefore, the... the district court's finding was clearly erroneous?"
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6202.587,6206.524,"Well, that... that concerns district 23, and... and--"
2005.05-204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,6206.524,6207.991,Aren't they equally precise here?
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6207.991,6209.257,--No.
2005.05-204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,6217.3,6217.769,I... I misspoke.
2005.05-204,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,6218.3,6233.793,"With respect to district 23, there's an unusual aspect to the GI Forum appellants' arguments in that it's unlike a typical racial gerrymandering claim where they say you're... you're seeking to draw lines based on race."
2005.05-204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,6405.458,6407.223,"--Thank you, Mr. Cruz."
2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6418.563,6421.577,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.05-204,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6452.173,6464.653,"May I ask you if you agree with General Cruz, that if the results of the 20... section... district 23 violated section 2, it would not be a defense that was politically motivated?"
2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6464.653,6466.825,"I... I think that's right, Justice Stevens, insofar as--"
2005.05-204,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6466.825,6478.477,And would you also agree with the second question I asked as to whether if it were a violation... I understand you don't think it was... it would not be a defense that they were able to create a district... a Hispanic district in another part of the State.
2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6478.477,6489.706,"--Well, that's true in the context that the Court said it in the Shaw II case, but we don't think that the principle of Shaw II would apply to the section 2 claim in the south and west part of Texas in this case."
2005.05-204,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6558.007,6563.879,Is that based on the premise that section... that district 25 and district 23 are in the same part of the State?
2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6563.879,6578.717,"--Yes, not just the same part of the State, but a part of the State that falls within the section 2... within the focus of the plaintiffs' section 2 claim, and a part of the State that's marked by its high concentration of minority citizen voting age population."
2005.05-204,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,6713.193,6728.967,Are there cases that... that we've issued from this Court that address what happens in a case like this where the economic circumstances and many other circumstances of the two Latino populations are very different?
2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6752.677,6754.239,"--Well, I don't know of a--"
2005.05-204,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,6754.239,6755.051,Have we talked about that?
2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6755.051,6757.863,--specific case that has addressed that concern.
2005.05-204,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6858.024,6862.445,"Is it possible it violates section 2, the following?"
2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6885.811,6891.542,"Well, I don't think that would bear on the typical section 2 analysis that this Court would apply."
2005.05-204,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6946.224,6947.989,I was thinking of district 23.
2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6947.989,6949.113,"--Oh, I'm sorry."

2005.05-204,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6997.453,6997.531,--The GI Forum drew.
2005.05-204,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,7021.755,7023.271,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."

2005.05-204,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,7264.344,7272.872,Who was the... who was the... the candidate in that district after the district court plan?
2005.05-204,4,38319,paul_m_smith,,7272.872,7275.387,"Mr. Frost continued to run in that district, Your Honor."
2005.05-204,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,7275.387,7278.979,"Well, didn't the district court say one of its criteria was preserving incumbency?"
2005.05-204,4,38319,paul_m_smith,,7278.979,7280.089,That's a different Federal district court.
