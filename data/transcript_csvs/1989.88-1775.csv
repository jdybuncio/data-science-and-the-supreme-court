1989.88-1775,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.158,"We'll hear argument first this morning No. 89-1775, Gary Peel v. the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois."
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,17.795,20.829,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1775,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,41.827,42.843,How do we know that?
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,45.112,54.401,"--Your Honor, there is no dispute in this record that the National Board of Trial Advocacy is a reputable and nonbogus organization."
1989.88-1775,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,65.942,67.658,"And this is all in the record, I take it?"
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,67.658,68.977,--This is in the record below.
1989.88-1775,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,70.077,70.66,Uh-huh.
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,70.66,71.912,There is no dispute about that fact.
1989.88-1775,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,71.912,79.25,Does the state recognize it as a... as an organization that certifies specialists?
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,79.25,84.154,The state does not recognize any organizations to certify specialists.
1989.88-1775,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.625,124.397,"How much of your case, Mr. Ennis, depends on the stature of this particular organization?"
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,124.397,142.109,"In this particular case, Your Honor, it does not matter at all because this Court's decisions made clear, beginning with R.M. J and followed in Shapero and Zauderer, that the states cannot place an absolute ban on potentially misleading speech."
1989.88-1775,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.109,154.0,"So if it were the Sangamon County Trial Lawyers' Association with a membership of about six in rotating musical chairs, that would still be true, so long as the statement were not false?"
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,154.0,154.533,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1775,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.02,197.862,"Well, what if it isn't a bogus organization but some little two-bit club that the lawyer truthfully says he belongs to and they've recognized him and given him some certificate?"
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,199.895,200.412,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1775,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.964,202.631,--And the state has to permit that?
1989.88-1775,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,202.631,215.039,"--Your Honor, I think that the same test would apply but in that circumstance application of the test may permit the state to ban statements of certification by that particular organization on the ground--"
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1107.084,1109.47,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1775,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1159.052,1164.706,"Mr. Marzen, how would this particular certification on Mr. Peel's letterhead help consumers?"
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1164.706,1184.101,"Well, if a consumer had a problem that involved litigation, they could look for someone who is certified as a civil trial specialist by the National Board of Trial Advocacy, in comparison to another practitioner who didn't have any certification or also didn't, through looking at Martindale-Hubbell or something else... didn't have any indication that he had courtroom experience for example."
1989.88-1775,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1184.101,1189.905,You think that would... that a lay person would understand the significance of that certification?
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1189.905,1198.527,A lay person certainly isn't going to know that NBTA certification means all the specific things that are required to get the certification.
1989.88-1775,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.755,1317.82,One case.
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1317.82,1318.456,Excuse me?
1989.88-1775,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.456,1319.656,One case.
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1320.839,1325.693,"Well, what one has to realize is that this is sort of a dynamic process."
1989.88-1775,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.424,1349.259,But you're not dealing with light bulbs here.
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1356.747,1357.114,--That's--
1989.88-1775,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.114,1378.345,"And... and simply because you can allow any organization to certify something... Good Housekeeping or United Labs, or whatever else for light bulbs... it doesn't mean you have to do it for the process of justice, for which counselor are... are members of the bar of the court."
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1378.345,1380.778,--Absolutely true and the legal services--
1989.88-1775,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.778,1384.665,And all... all you tell me the state can look to is whether you have one trial.
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1384.665,1385.315,--No.
1989.88-1775,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.136,1426.576,"It isn't just a matter of complexity, it's a matter of it being part of the process of justice that the Illinois Supreme Court and other courts are charged with meting out."
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1426.576,1445.62,"I understand that it's part of the process of justice, but in fact allowing people to... to announce and to disseminate information about certification is in the very highest traditions of the standards of the bar in maintaining and improving the quality of advocacy and all other forms of service."
1989.88-1775,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.986,1578.39,"But it would have pretty well killed the usefulness of the... of the letterhead, too, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1595.852,1597.954,"--Not as much as I'd like, Justice Rehnquist."
1989.88-1775,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1609.428,1610.761,"But that's not true, is it?"
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1619.551,1622.819,That's... we... okay.
1989.88-1775,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1635.21,1641.214,So... so you say the state should not be allowed to require a disclaimer as to this ad?
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1641.214,1642.947,--Yes.
1989.88-1775,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.947,1645.983,"You're saying it's a... it's a lie, but at least it's constitutional?"
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1646.684,1647.0,No.
1989.88-1775,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.002,1675.235,So... so where do we come out here?
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1681.858,1684.424,I would not think that a disclaimer would be appropriate.
1989.88-1775,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1684.424,1685.09,"No, I... I--"
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1686.574,1687.459,Okay.
1989.88-1775,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.459,1689.576,It's not a question as to whether it's appropriate.
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1691.078,1698.248,"We... the... on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission, a disclaimer would not be permitted by the Constitution in this case."
1989.88-1775,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.289,1709.122,"Well, I thought you said--"
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1709.122,1710.455,--that would have entirely remedied what it had--
1989.88-1775,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.455,1721.227,--I thought you said a moment ago that the state could require not only the disclaimer but that this does not imply any claim of expertise.
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1723.596,1725.798,--My answer is no.
1989.88-1775,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.315,1728.767,"No, that you didn't say it or no that you wish you hadn't said it?"
1989.88-1775,1,41746,steven_j_marzen,,1731.118,1732.334,"--The latter, Justice Rehnquist."
1989.88-1775,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.14,1746.128,Mr. Moran.
1989.88-1775,2,45600,william_f_moran_iii,,1746.128,1749.346,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1775,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1769.042,1773.195,"Do you... Mr. Moran, do... do... does Illinois do it on the medical side?"
1989.88-1775,2,45600,william_f_moran_iii,,1773.195,1777.063,"--The state does not do it, Your Honor."
1989.88-1775,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1785.419,1787.371,And the state doesn't object to that?
1989.88-1775,2,45600,william_f_moran_iii,,1787.371,1800.013,"They do not regulate it, though it is our argument that if the state chose to regulate those board certifications, it would be with... it would be within their authority to do so."
1989.88-1775,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.013,1801.679,May I ask one... one?
1989.88-1775,2,45600,william_f_moran_iii,,1808.869,1809.252,Yes.
1989.88-1775,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.623,1818.391,Don't you think that's perhaps more misleading than this... this... particular--
1989.88-1775,2,45600,william_f_moran_iii,,1824.044,1827.413,"Well, Your Honor, because this Court sets the qualifications--"
1989.88-1775,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.413,1831.032,Doesn't that imply that they've been here a lot and argued a lot of cases and we know them very well?
1989.88-1775,2,45600,william_f_moran_iii,,1832.567,1835.769,"--Well, they would be allowed to say that they were admitted in the Court--"
1989.88-1775,3,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3577.267,3595.728,"In response to questions from Justice O'Connor and Justice White, the state acknowledged that Illinois does not have a blanket rule which prohibits attorneys from saying they concentrate their practice in civil trials, even though there is no objective standard in Illinois for what concentrate means."
1989.88-1775,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3630.401,3642.459,"Mr. Ennis, I've been thinking about your assertion that the source of confusion said to exist by the Illinois Supreme Court is that they think that certified means certified by Illinois."
1989.88-1775,3,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3685.201,3686.786,"--First, Your Honor, that speculation."
1989.88-1775,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3722.71,3724.776,"Your time has expired, Mr. Ennis."
