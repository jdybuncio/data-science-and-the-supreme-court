1968.228,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,22.104,"T. Willingham, C.A. Jarvis, petitioners, versus Daniel Morgan."
1968.228,0,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,23.549,27.851,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,1690.354,1694.097,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.228,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1961.729,1965.799,"What if those cases involved Revenue agents, that there --"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,1965.799,1968.801,"Prohibition agents who have come out of the Revenue part of this statute, yes, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1968.801,1973.639,"You're right, who -- and this in the episode and not knowing that was criminal case in the emphasis of --"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,1973.639,1975.037,"They are both criminal cases, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1975.037,1979.486,Happened somewhere out on the countryside in the territory of a state.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,1979.486,1980.674,Right.
1968.228,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.674,1982.798,"There was a murder, I think, a murder charge."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,1982.798,1984.283,In both cases.
1968.228,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.283,2003.056,"And here, as I understand it, the claim is that the very allegation that the only association between the defendant and the plaintiff was within the prison walls of Leavenworth Penitentiary."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2008.234,2027.776,"Well, Your Honor, that allegation was made first in the petition -- in the affidavit supporting the motion for salary judgment and was evidently cast in the terms of Barr versus Matteo, an immunity rather than removability."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2239.912,2245.549,What do you say would have to be alleged in order to show what under color was?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2245.549,2251.296,"Perhaps I can best answer that question, Mr. Justice Black, by saying what was not alleged in this case."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2253.12,2257.532,But then what -- you could tell us what could be alleged.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2257.532,2259.286,"Well, I shall, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2290.686,2292.49,Do they show where it happened?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2292.49,2294.616,"No, there is no mention of these incidents."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2294.616,2298.249,You didn't get any complaint about why -- where it happened?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2298.249,2299.924,"In the petitions, Your Honor?"
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2299.924,2300.451,Yes.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2300.451,2301.207,No.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2301.207,2305.02,The plaintiff's case -- anything in the plaintiff's complaint?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2305.02,2307.583,"Yes, the plaintiff has a very detailed complaint."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2307.583,2309.457,Where does he say it happened?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2309.457,2310.256,He does not say so.
1968.228,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2313.258,2314.883,"Well, it was in the prison."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2314.883,2316.368,"It was in the prison, yes, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.368,2318.903,How do you know that?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2318.903,2326.047,"He says so, and this is not controverted by either party."
1968.228,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.231,2337.944,You say that the fact that it happened in the prison isn't enough.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2337.944,2359.785,"It is not enough, Your Honor, because, other than official acts maybe committed within prisons and with regarded to the question that Mr. Justice Fortas raised, I think that it might be fairly easy to establish removability in the case of the prison guard who beat, but certainly not immunity."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2359.785,2360.931,Did they say what he did?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2362.795,2369.085,"The complaint alleges, Your Honor, that he was inoculated with various harmful substances."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2369.085,2376.139,"I mean, do you cite in the complaint charge what the defendant does."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2376.139,2376.846,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2376.846,2379.02,What do you say he does?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2379.02,2380.186,The defendant?
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2380.186,2380.434,Yes.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2382.368,2383.396,As Warden.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2383.396,2384.085,Warden?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2384.085,2384.113,Yes.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2384.113,2384.939,Of the prisoner?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2384.939,2400.4,"All the interrogatories which were submitted by respondent, in several places, raise some question as to whether he was actually acting as Warden at the time that some of these acts were -- alleged acts were committed."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2400.4,2416.415,"Why would that be necessary and the statute intended if the man is in a prison and the Warden is therein guarding prisoners, isn't it enough to say that he is the Warden in order to get removal?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2419.756,2423.289,"Because that merely establishes, Your Honor, that he's a federal officer."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2423.359,2428.195,"Well, that means he's a federal officer inside the prison and that this man was a prisoner."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2428.195,2435.728,It does not establish that every act which he commits within that prison is under color of office.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2437.043,2439.728,"Well, what are his charges?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2439.728,2440.716,The charges of the plaintiff?
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2440.716,2443.49,What he charges the Warden of having done.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2443.49,2449.913,He charges the Warden with having knocked him on the ground.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2449.913,2450.729,In the prison.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2450.729,2452.496,In the prison.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2459.69,2470.041,"Well, wouldn't that be a care within an inference unanswered, because what he did was to knock him down while he is tending to his duties as a guard?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2470.041,2481.325,"Well, that may be, Your Honor, except we do not think that it meets the test put down by this Court in those two cases."
1968.228,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2481.325,2487.711,I wonder if the matter of burden of going forward may be relevant here.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2571.48,2590.613,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, it's perfectly true that the burden of going forward in such a case, in a case of removable -- removal power is upon the other party, not upon the person seeking removal, but the burden of proof does not shift and --"
1968.228,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2590.613,2594.124,What did he do with respect to the burden of going forward?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2596.727,2605.146,There's nothing in the record which would suggest the burden of going forward exists because it does not exist until there's some factual basis which require --
1968.228,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2605.146,2623.606,"Well, I'm -- I might -- let us assume for the moment that we should conclude that where it is alleged that injuries took place within the prison and that the -- where it is shown that the defendants are officials of the prison."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2686.536,2696.638,"Well, Your Honor, the conclusionary statements of the petitioners were met by an equally conclusionary statement of the respondent."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2696.638,2700.131,Did this Court act on that?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2700.131,2703.824,"The Court of -- the District Court evidently did, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2703.824,2707.115,And did either one object to it?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2707.115,2713.84,"No, Your Honor, this question was not really litigated in the District Court to any extent."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2718.84,2724.862,And the parties chose to submit it to the Court on the allegations of the pleadings up to that time?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2724.862,2726.05,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2726.05,2728.852,Then why shouldn't -- why do we need to go any further?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2728.852,2733.044,"Because this is a question of jurisdiction, Your Honor, under the federal statute."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2733.044,2734.129,Does that change it?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2740.854,2743.397,"They cannot waive a jurisdiction requirement, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2743.397,2752.759,"Well, it can't waive the jurisdiction requirement, but what evidence -- what are they going to pass on if not on the allegations in the pleadings?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2758.915,2762.566,I think the allegations weren't effective.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2762.566,2764.999,For failing to allege what?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2764.999,2775.284,"Facts to support the conclusion, from which the Court could draw the conclusion that the Warden in performing these acts, if he did perform them, was acting under color of his office."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2775.284,2778.206,That's really the sole issue?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2778.206,2780.841,"That is the issue as I see it, Your Honor, yes."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.827,2791.079,Once you decide that case is over.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2791.079,2791.756,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2803.908,2813.611,"But once you've proved that the Warden did this outside the scope of his authority, you recover against the Warden and everybody else."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2815.435,2825.032,"No, as the Court has said, this is not -- this Court said in the Symes case, this is not a question of guilt or innocence."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.373,2842.327,"Well, you have -- you first have to prove that the incident did occur."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2842.327,2848.632,"I would think, under the holding in Colorado versus Symes, that would not be true, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2848.632,2853.968,"Well, how did you find out when he was acting under color of authority and when he was not?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2853.968,2855.325,"Well, he asked what --"
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2855.325,2861.702,"The only way, I submit, you could do it is, when he was beating the man up, he was outside the color of authority."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2861.702,2861.84,Can he not an --
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.84,2864.153,"Once you proved that, you've proved your case."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2864.153,2873.274,"Can he not answer, Your Honor, that “if I beat him up, this was in the exercise of the ordinary discipline of the prison”?"
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2897.618,2899.642,All he has to show is he beat him up.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2901.486,2906.317,"No, all he has to do is show that, in his relations with his prisoner, he was always acting --"
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2906.317,2907.902,"Well, wouldn't --"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2907.902,2907.98,In his official capacity.
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2907.98,2918.984,If there's some substance to the fact that Leavenworth is a maximum security prison and the respondent was in that prison.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2929.838,2932.772,"No, it had happened in the prison, whatever happened."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.772,2939.983,"And then, wouldn't normal reaction be that it was under color of his office?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2939.983,2948.463,"I should assume, Your Honor, that that would be a rather easy thing to do, to establish, but not the slightest effort was made."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2948.463,2963.364,"Well, I submit that the fact that he says “the only time I came in contact with this man was inside the prison when I was the Warden.”"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2968.164,2971.156,"That it might be under color of office, but it does not establish it."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.156,2975.497,"Well, what else would he have to say other than under color of authority?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2983.375,2985.07,"No, that does not have to be said."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.07,2987.813,What could he say?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,2987.813,2997.24,"He must be able, as this Court said, to show the -- were not connected with unofficial activities."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2997.24,3000.474,"Well, suppose he said just that, would that be enough?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3000.474,3002.099,"No, there must be facts."
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3002.099,3004.343,What other facts?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3004.343,3015.816,That is what I find hard to understand from the opinion of this Court in Maryland versus Soper because the petition there was so detailed in its allegations of facts.
1968.228,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3018.598,3025.613,"Well, wouldn't that be true in this?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3025.613,3034.813,I suppose a good deal depends upon the allegations in the original complaint as to what he would have to say.
1968.228,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3055.494,3093.239,"Don't you think that's what he tried to do in paragraph 8 of the petition for removal on page 9 of the appendix where he says, before that, he's alleged that he was the Warden, etcetera and now -- and then at paragraph 8 he says that anything that was done or may have been done was done under color of office and as an employee and etcetera, and that the acts complaint of was made solely under color of office and within the scope of their authority."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3093.239,3093.806,And as --
1968.228,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3093.806,3119.399,"There is a general allegation and then the question is whether in fact the burden of going, seems to me, that maybe the question is that the -- whether the burden of going forward with particularized allegations, more -- much more particularized than in the complaint of which, as you said earlier, is pretty general too."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3129.32,3144.083,"Well, my comment on that, Your Honor, would be that paragraph 8, in most parts, is conclusionary in nature, and I would think that the burden of going forward with the proof does not shift until there's been some proof."
1968.228,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3144.083,3172.056,"Well, what you're really saying is raising as a question as to whether paragraph 8 is sufficiently particularized to shift the burden of going forward, and I suppose that then the question would naturally arise as to whether you can expect more than that at this stage of the case and whether that's adequate as a matter of law."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3172.056,3173.973,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3173.973,3176.666,One of these defendants was a petitioner.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3176.666,3178.44,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3178.44,3188.507,"And they show -- the record show that he had been assigned there to do the services as a physician, does it not?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3188.507,3190.281,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3190.281,3210.089,"And that the complaint is based on the charge that this position for the team with the aid of the other man conniving with him to take some kind of shot in his arm or leg or something, and he did in great arm."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3226.053,3227.358,"No, Your Honor, I think it was very simple."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3227.358,3228.885,When everybody agrees to it.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3230.273,3240.958,"It would be very simple to submit an ordinary medical record showing that this was the ordinary medical treatment, and this negates then any possibility --"
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3240.958,3241.387,But he doesn't --
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3241.387,3241.996,The doctor was --
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3241.996,3244.93,He doesn't allege it was an extraordinary one.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3246.747,3246.945,He have actually --
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3246.945,3249.847,He was given this serum and he thought it might kill him.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3249.847,3252.552,He alleges that they did this on a frolic of their own.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3252.552,3253.568,He doesn't say that.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3253.568,3255.442,"Yes, in the complaint, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3255.442,3256.041,What?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3256.041,3257.408,In his complaint.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3257.408,3267.398,What part?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3267.398,3289.774,"It's actually -- I maybe wrong on that, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3299.245,3311.621,"As I gather, what he alleges is the treatment of the serum, this doctor, the other man was helping, he gave it to him, and he then fell to the floor."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3311.621,3316.062,"Well, I would suppose a hypothetical question, Your Honor, a situation."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3337.162,3340.044,"Well, that's a possibility, of course."
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3347.215,3347.385,"But, again --"
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3347.385,3350.337,I don't see why you have to go any further than the pleadings.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3350.337,3354.04,"Because this Court so held in Maryland versus Soper, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3354.04,3354.717,In what?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3354.717,3369.815,"Maryland versus Soper, that the allegation had to be sufficient to show that not only were they at the time performing their official duties, but they weren't performing any other acts which were not related to their official duties."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3377.131,3378.656,But you look at the whole record.
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3400.832,3402.377,They should allege some fact.
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3402.377,3410.989,"Well, that's right but if it does allege it, why not enough if it's not denied?"
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3410.989,3414.143,"The only answer I'd have to that, Your Honor, is that we're dealing with the jurisdictional method of it."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3414.143,3417.357,But why would the jurisdiction make up such a noise?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3433.229,3455.091,"Well, perhaps a distinction should be drawn between a case which is removed under 1441 where the pleadings themselves must establish that the District Court would have original jurisdiction, and 1442 (a) where the sole jurisdiction of the Federal Court is derivative."
1968.228,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3490.223,3500.845,Do you know of any state in the Union that is not sufficient to file a complaint without swearing to it and you just whether or not the Court has jurisdiction by what's alleged?
1968.228,1,33047,joseph_m_snee,,3500.845,3504.218,"That's true, Your Honor."
1968.228,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3508.051,3509.436,Mr. Beytagh.
1968.228,2,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3509.436,3511.961,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.228,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3558.022,3574.076,"Well, are you relying on the allegations of the papers as being the facts so far as this trial is concerned or do you think he's right in indicating, as I gather, there's an indication that you had to have some form too?"
1968.228,2,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3574.076,3574.653,"No, Your Honor."
1968.228,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3599.599,3601.047,"Well, it isn't quite that."
1968.228,2,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3649.998,3651.306,I think that's --
1968.228,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3651.306,3651.524,Order.
1968.228,2,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3651.524,3679.042,"That that's correct, but it seems to me that any of that would've been subject to the same claim that it was conlusi -- conclusionary in nature and, therefore, inadequate and it seems to us that the District Court had an adequate basis here and that Section 1446 on which respondent now relies is mentioned by the Court of Appeals only in one sense."
1968.228,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3700.012,3706.804,"Mr. Beytagh, I take it though, you say that the removal test is narrower that the course of employment."
1968.228,2,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3706.804,3710.786,I think course of employment is a somewhat different notion.
1968.228,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3711.026,3712.361,"Well, it's narrower."
1968.228,2,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3721.718,3724.8,"I think it may not be enough, Your Honor."
