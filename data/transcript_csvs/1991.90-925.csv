1991.90-925,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.706,"We'll hear argument now in Case No. 90-925, The Immigration and Nationalization Service v. Joseph Patrick Doherty."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,53.385,57.087,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-925,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.794,346.006,"Was it customary that people faced with deportation could indicate the country they'd like to go to, and if the country were willing to accept them that normally that's where the person would be sent?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,349.374,359.48,"Your Honor, under the statute, under 243(a), an alien has the opportunity to designate the country that he wants to be deported to."
1991.90-925,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.878,416.75,Was it at all a surprise that the Attorney General designated the United Kingdom instead of Ireland as had been designated?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,416.75,419.35,"Your Honor, I do not believe it was a surprise."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,504.939,507.824,Of course in that case he didn't have the reason that's advanced here.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,507.824,511.212,"--Your Honor, he did have the reason that's advanced here."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.212,516.247,"No, his reason was some dentist had called on him or something like that, and that was the only new development."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,516.247,518.048,"Oh, in Abudu?"
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.048,518.881,"In Abudu, yeah."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,518.881,523.269,"Oh, in that it was an official in the foreign government who had come to his house--"
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.269,524.769,"Oh, and said they needed a doctor in Ghana."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,524.769,525.819,--They said they needed a doctor.
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.887,529.173,And we said that wasn't enough to justify it.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,529.173,544.532,"--Well, this Court found that it may well have been new in material evidence, but that he actually had a sufficient basis to assert his claim at the time of the hearing, and therefore, it couldn't constitute a reasonable explanation for having failed to raise the claim at the time of the initial hearing."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.204,563.644,"But even if he had adequate grounds in the first place, if there was a new development that was sufficiently significant, Abudu wouldn't have said he couldn't have raised a new ground."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,563.644,566.596,"--The board decision in Abudu did say that, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,567.548,569.231,But we didn't say that.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,569.231,572.016,"--Well, this Court in Abudu didn't--"
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.016,572.733,Because I remember the case.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,572.733,587.092,"--This Court in Abudu didn't clarify the precise bounds of the discretion that the board would have or that the Attorney General would have, but this Court did assume in Abudu that the new evidence was material, but that--"
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.092,588.461,But not sufficiently important.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,598.067,599.233,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,599.233,603.054,"So in this case, though, there's a difference in what the new development is."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,608.875,610.875,"Your Honor, I believe that it's less significant."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,620.397,628.519,"Well, and the law changed and he's going to go to England in any event now, which he wouldn't have... which would not have been the fact at the time that you say he had to make his election."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,628.519,634.656,"--Well, Your Honor, at the time that he had to make his election... you're referring to the change in Irish law?"
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.656,635.073,Yes.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,635.073,653.154,"Well, first of all, I think that it's difficult for Mr. Doherty to claim that Irish law changed in a way that was in fact prejudicial to him since he in fact represented to the board in December of 1986 that decisions of the Irish Supreme Court had, quote,"
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.563,678.353,"Are you saying if he'd, even at the time of the election, if he'd been deported to Ireland at that time, he still would have gone right to England in any event?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,680.586,686.874,--Saying that the law of extradition in Ireland at that time is not fundamentally different to what it is now.
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,686.874,693.378,"Well, does that mean that the net result of it is that if he'd gone to Ireland he still would have gone right away to England?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,693.378,695.061,"No, Your Honor, that isn't what we would say."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.061,695.628,"Well, then that's different, isn't it?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,695.628,707.369,"No, because both before the change in Irish law and after the adoption of the European Convention on Terrorism, there was the possibility that the Irish Government would not extradite him."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,718.243,721.211,Let me ask you... it's very difficult to sort out all these things.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,730.051,731.801,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.801,732.167,You don't think so.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,732.167,748.596,"Because even the new law has exceptions in it that allows the alien, or excuse me, the person subject to extradition in Ireland to try to establish that he's being... the reason for the extradition is for persecution reasons."
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.596,750.463,"Well, of course the court of appeals didn't agree with you."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,750.463,752.23,"No, but the court of appeals really--"
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.23,752.88,On this issue either.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,752.88,771.628,"--Well, the court of appeals rested more on the question of whether or not the rejection of the designation by the Attorney General provided a reasonable explanation for Mr. Doherty's failure to pursue his claims for withholding of deportation and asylum at the time of the hearing in 1986."
1991.90-925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.33,782.417,"Before you do that, if it is as you say, why would he have had this change of heart?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,789.34,792.124,--Why would he no longer wish to go to Ireland?
1991.90-925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.074,793.724,Yes.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,793.724,818.323,"Your Honor, that question is not answered by the Attorney General or by the courts in this case, but I would note that he filed his motion to reopen the proceedings based upon the change in Irish law less than 1 month after the Attorney General Meese sent him a letter stating that he had accepted the INS appeal from the board's rejection of the designation letter."
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.131,835.384,I thought that... didn't Attorney General Meese order him to be sent to England?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,835.384,852.163,"Yes, he did, Your Honor, but the motion to reopen based upon the change in Irish law was filed less than a month after the Attorney General, Attorney General Meese notified Mr. Doherty that he had accepted the appeal of the INS from the board's decision."
1991.90-925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.715,862.602,"You think he was rolling the dice, that what he'd like most of all was to stay in this country, not be deported at all."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,876.195,878.063,"--One intermediate step, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.438,917.972,May I ask another question?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,941.068,948.841,"No, Your Honor, the Attorney General did not find that he would certainly end up in England no matter what."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.891,950.776,But that's my point.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,953.978,955.578,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm not being clear."
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.536,1053.142,Do you have a better reason than just failure to plead for sustaining the Attorney General's discretion?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1053.142,1056.277,"Well, your Honor, it wasn't just that he failed to plead."
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.616,1064.416,"Well, that may be so."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1066.151,1068.368,"Yes, Your Honor, there are additional reasons."
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.368,1070.77,"Well, your time is certainly running."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1070.77,1078.376,"The... if we look to issue of the merits, we can look first at the issue of asylum."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.594,1169.985,"May I ask... again, I should be better advised as to facts than I am, but is one of the grounds by the Attorney General exercised his discretion was because the Attorney General's believe that he was ineligible for asylum?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1169.985,1175.039,"--No, Your Honor, he did not find that he was ineligible for asylum."
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.915,1244.016,And it's your submission that this ground was an independent ground?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1244.016,1244.783,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.783,1254.722,"And that if we said... sustained the exercise of the discretion of what you said before this, we don't need to get to the foreign policy issue?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1254.722,1255.755,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.309,1261.743,On either one of them.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1261.743,1276.402,"Or on asylum, you could sustain it on the basis that the fact that Mr. Doherty was... had admitted that he had been convicted for a number of offenses was sufficient to allow the exercise of discretion to deny asylum."
1991.90-925,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1276.402,1278.837,Or on grounds of waiver.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1280.706,1294.614,"Well, waiver really... I referred to, in this argument, as failure to establish good cause or reasonable explanation for asserting his claims for withholding an asylum at the time of the September 1986 hearing."
1991.90-925,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1296.899,1298.834,"Well, is it quite the same?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1306.856,1307.639,"Yes, he did."
1991.90-925,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1314.427,1318.581,"If you lose on that, I take it you still have to address the withholding."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1318.581,1320.831,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.457,1391.111,And is it your position that the Attorney General can make that determination without any kind of a hearing at all?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1391.111,1393.645,"--Yes, Your Honor, in this case he can."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1401.049,1409.672,"Yes, as I understand your position, he could have denied it outright, even without any hearing at all because even though... you're not now relying on the breadth of discretion."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1415.893,1428.653,--Statutorily ineligible because of the undisputed facts from... established in the extradition transcript showed that he simply would not be able to satisfy showing--
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1428.653,1434.806,"Even though the hearing officer in that transcript, the judge, came to the conclusion that the nonpolitical language did not apply."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1437.758,1444.428,"--Well, although the judge in that case, Your Honor, acknowledged... said right out that the facts were not really in dispute."
1991.90-925,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1484.822,1493.076,"Counsel, is there, in your view, any limit to the Attorney General's discretion to deny asylum?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1493.076,1502.015,"Your Honor, that limit would be the limits of irrationality, wholly arbitrary--"
1991.90-925,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1502.015,1507.236,"Did he deny it on the basis of a race, pure and simple?"
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1507.236,1520.162,"--Your Honor, I believe that the Attorney General would find that it would not be appropriate to deny asylum on the basis of race."
1991.90-925,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1533.053,1537.005,So you are saying there are some limits somewhere out there.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1537.005,1565.524,"Well, Your Honor, I think that it is fair to say that when the Attorney General exercise his discretion under the asylum provision for reasons such as foreign policy or other political reasons, that the decision is essentially unreviewable, much for the same reasons that the Second Circuit in this case found that Attorney General Meese's decision that it would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States to send Mr. Doherty to Ireland would--"
1991.90-925,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1565.524,1584.503,"Would you take that position even if the Attorney General determined that the refugee would be subject to persecution on his return and that that would be wrong, but nevertheless that persecution furthered U.S. interests."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1587.955,1603.398,"--Your Honor, I think that the Attorney General could properly find that Mr. Doherty's interests in sanctuary in the United States were not paramount, even if he was potentially going to be subjected to persecution in the United Kingdom."
1991.90-925,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.388,1639.438,"If I could, counsel."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1661.253,1663.336,"--Your Honor, I do think there is a difference, yes."
1991.90-925,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1673.894,1674.577,What's your best case for that?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1674.577,1675.277,Excuse me?
1991.90-925,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1675.277,1677.279,What's your principal authority for that?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1677.279,1680.481,I believe that in Wang this Court--
1991.90-925,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1680.481,1680.865,In Wang.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1680.865,1687.986,--In Wang this Court indicated that it was important to give the Attorney General discretion to come up with--
1991.90-925,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.986,1690.42,Was that a withholding of deportation case?
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1690.42,1691.522,"--No, it was not, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.057,1698.526,Justice Blackmun I think had a question.
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1714.019,1715.138,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1715.138,1719.173,"And I had this one question, too."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1735.301,1743.788,"On a motion to reopen, we submit it should be an abuse of discretion because it is a mixed question of whether or not... of fact and law."
1991.90-925,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.513,1756.981,"--So it's deference, abuse of discretion, and a mixed question of law."
1991.90-925,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1756.981,1757.665,Thank you.
1991.90-925,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.665,1759.333,"Thank you, Ms. Mahoney."
1991.90-925,1,36499,mary_boresz_pike,,1761.0,1774.342,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.379,1883.814,What did those... what did those acts consist of that he so found?
1991.90-925,1,36499,mary_boresz_pike,,1883.814,1887.016,"--There were two sets of acts, Justice Scalia."
1991.90-925,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.378,1933.545,May I interrupt?
1991.90-925,1,36499,mary_boresz_pike,,1939.665,1949.422,"--In that trial, Your Honor, he was convicted of murder, attempted murder, possession of weapons, and for being a member of a proscribed organization."
1991.90-925,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2049.335,2056.191,"Well, we are dealing though here, Ms. Pike, I think with a motion to reopen."
1991.90-925,1,36499,mary_boresz_pike,,2062.945,2069.332,"--Your Honor, motions to reopen, of course, are committed to the discretion of the decisionmaker."
