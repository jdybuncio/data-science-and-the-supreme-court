1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.206,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 89-453, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,18.795,32.721,This case involves the FCC's policies of awarding substantial preferences in comparative licensing proceedings to certain minority and female applicants for new television and radio broadcast stations throughout the United States.
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.959,221.811,"Excuse me, Mr.--"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,221.811,222.161,--is diversity of perspective--
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.161,223.711,"--Excuse me, Mr. Guillot."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,223.711,225.096,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.096,232.916,Is... is... is it clear that the gender-based issue is necessarily before us here?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,232.916,238.504,"It is absolutely clear, in our opinion, that the gender-based issue is... is before the Court for several reasons."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.766,313.654,You wouldn't win if we just found the racial preferences invalid?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,315.487,316.606,"It's a close call, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.305,348.141,We... we don't ordinarily want to give sweeping decisions if they don't affect your particular case.
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,354.878,365.151,"Actually, it would not, Your Honor, because Metro prevailed on the... on the other criterion recognized by the Commission below, particularly local residence and civic participation."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.668,401.942,You... you mean it's clear that the Commission would have reached the same result had it not given your opponent the racial preference?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,403.076,404.228,"That is not clear, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.228,412.314,"Well, if that's not clear then we can't affirm the Commission's decision if we invalidate the racial preference; isn't that right?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,412.314,423.789,"The Commission's decision, we don't feel, can be... can be affirmed on any grounds, but the racial and gender preferences had a synergistic effect in the present proceeding."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.193,429.393,I don't think it's confusing at all.
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,444.103,449.007,"--But we... a remand is certainly a possibility, and though we don't favor one we're not discounting it."
1989.89-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.099,466.132,May I just ask you this?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,475.074,479.276,"I still think, Justice Stevens, that you should vote for the invalidation of both--"
1989.89-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.276,480.909,"I understand that, but that's not my question."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,485.096,497.82,"--I think that you should... you should vote to... to award the construction permit to Metro, and if... and if it's not clear in the record as to what the separate bases were for the two preferences, then a remand is a possible--"
1989.89-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.82,506.093,"The simple answer to my question is if I think the racial preference is bad and the gender preference is all right, I should still vote to reverse."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,507.961,515.449,"--We feel that you should, Your Honor, but again, we're limited by the judgment of the review board and the FCC, and it's not clear that they feel the same way."
1989.89-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.449,520.019,"But if that's the disposition, then I would not have to reach the gender preference."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,520.019,523.304,We feel that there are serious consequences in not reaching the gender preference.
1989.89-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.304,525.487,"Well, I understand, but as you have just told us we review judgments."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,528.439,529.791,"That's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,803.987,819.013,"Mr. Guillot, it is true, I suppose that very few licenses are owned by people of minority race."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,819.013,820.896,"That's true, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,820.896,828.869,And perhaps the situation is such that it would justify some remedial action.
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,840.677,847.231,"Your Honor, Metro is not against affirmative action programs per se, and we feel that there might well be a need for remedial action."
1989.89-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,848.949,850.635,Then who could take that action?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,854.253,866.41,"Only Congress, Justice O'Connor, because we feel that under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, only Congress, and uniquely Congress, has that broad kind of power to remedy societal discrimination."
1989.89-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,874.148,876.766,"Well, Congress took some kind of action here."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,880.404,895.58,--The action of Congress at best should be viewed as an unconstitutional attempt to impose a remedial action on the Commission to perpetuate these policies without any findings of past discrimination.
1989.89-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,895.58,902.983,"Should we... should we take it as a given, then, that Congress was acting to achieve remedial ends?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,902.983,932.17,"Well, that's not a given, Justice O'Connor, because as you have said in the Croson decision, underrepresentation in and of itself is not evidence of past discrimination, and in the 1987 hearings before Congress, in the 1989 hearings before Congress regarding minority ownership, it was made clear both by commissioners that testified before Congress and Congress that there was... that the underrepresentation was the sole indicia of the supposed past discrimination."
1989.89-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,932.17,964.308,"Well, suppose that we had a difficult time establishing that state discrimination was responsible for this disparity in minority ownership, couldn't the Congress, pursuant to its commerce powers or pursuant to the powers it has to regulate the airwaves, which essentially comes from the commerce power, simply say that as a matter of sound policy we want minority ownership?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,972.414,979.068,"Well, the Fourteenth Amendment is only applicable insofar as Congress perceives this as a remedial measure, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,979.068,986.137,"Well, but why is Congress limited to the Fourteenth Amendment when it makes... when it has a remedial program?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,986.137,992.577,"No, Congress is limited to the Fourteenth Amendment, we believe, when it seeks to redress society-wide discrimination."
1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1010.122,1011.272,Mr. Guillot?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1011.272,1012.605,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1012.605,1027.231,"Are you saying that Congress' power under Section 5 goes further than to redress discrimination caused by states, who are the ones that are subject to the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1027.231,1033.202,"It goes far enough to... that's not clear by the decisions of this Court, quite honestly, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.895,1053.132,"Congress itself is limited by the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, isn't it?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1053.132,1057.77,"Under Bolling v. Sharpe and other cases, yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.029,1090.741,"Has there been any argument by the FCC or the competing applicants here who rest on their minority credentials, has there been any argument that the FCC has in any way furthered discrimination by its past licensing activities?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1090.741,1093.359,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that is clear."
1989.89-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1137.638,1151.295,"Has the FCC ever concluded that their... that a prima facie case, at least, exists to show some discrimination in the allocation of licenses in the past?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1151.295,1154.247,"Your Honor, the FCC has done exactly the opposite."
1989.89-453,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1174.495,1182.767,"Well, has the FCC ever assessed whether broadcasting does present presently diverse viewpoints?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1182.767,1189.237,"Actually, I was just looking at a First Amendment case, Your Honor, that was before this Court."
1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.474,1273.51,"Well, what are... what are the six classifications?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1275.06,1275.962,--I hope so.
1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1275.962,1276.828,"I do, too."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1278.145,1289.286,"They are gender, black ownership and participation, Pacific Islanders, Alaskans... Aleutians are really what is specified there... Asians and Hispanics."
1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1302.78,1308.699,"What... what other standards for program diversity does the Commission have, I mean other... other than the minority aspect?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1308.699,1313.051,"--The Commission has... Your Honor, this is a key point in the case, we feel."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.773,1347.408,You... you don't really agree with that anyway?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1347.408,1347.824,--Pardon me?
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.824,1358.264,"You don't really agree with that policy, either, because you just said a little time ago that... that, in fact, the programming will be determined by what makes money."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1360.632,1362.334,"We don't agree with that notion at all, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.334,1377.094,So the... the evil of having one person own it is probably not... not an evil of not having diverse viewpoints but an evil of... of restricting advertising rates or things of that sort?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1377.094,1394.122,"We feel... we feel that that's absolutely correct, Your Honor, and it's even more correct now than it ever was before because there are more stations and more sources of information and viewpoints to the public than there have ever been before, from cable television to wireless transmissions to satellite dishes."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.405,1428.36,"The FC... the FCC and the licensed companies suggest that this policy is not just any more a Commission policy, that it's been adopted by Congress."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1428.36,1429.545,"Well, that's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.545,1431.512,"We don't know the basis on which Congress adopted it, do we?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1435.582,1437.249,"Well, we feel that they were, Your Honor."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1497.971,1502.358,We... we enforce congressional statutes whether they knew what was going on or not.
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1508.845,1509.445,"Sure, and we don't deny--"
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.445,1509.896,--read about it.
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1515.382,1531.192,"--And we don't deny that Congress generally or even all the time makes their decisions on that basis, but we need to look closer when we find that they're making decisions that impose race, ethnic and gender-based classifications upon society in violation of the equal protection principles."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1531.192,1534.044,"xxx categories Congress has to make a record, is that it?"
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1537.163,1538.781,There have to be findings.
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1541.7,1543.133,Where do you get that?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1546.119,1548.071,"--No, Your Honor, out of Fullilove."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.176,1564.413,Congress cannot... cannot enact a valid piece of legislation in this field without making findings?
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1565.865,1575.388,"Well, Your Honor, we've been talking about the remedial basis for the... for the legislation, and in order for there to be a remedial basis how can there be no findings if there's something that needs to be remedied?"
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1575.388,1587.112,"We can, as we often do with legislation, see whether there is a plausible basis for the legislation but without demanding what the Constitution does not require, that Congress give reasons for its legislation."
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1588.746,1598.753,"Well, Your Honor, that is not the standard that was enunciated by this course in Fullilove... this Court in Fullilove for reviewing race and ethnic-based classifications under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1989.89-453,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1599.886,1603.305,You read it too broad.
1989.89-453,0,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,1603.305,1608.859,--I... I... I do think that it has been read too broadly by the Commission and the amici in this case.
1989.89-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.773,1685.625,"Very well, Mr. Guillot."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1688.743,1692.378,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.086,1764.474,"You would concede that if the Court should find against you on the racial portion, we would have to set aside the Commission's action here?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1764.474,1766.259,"--Justice Scalia, there would have to be a remand."
1989.89-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.66,1851.865,"The assumption of the Commission, I take it, is that if there are more minority owners, there will be more diversity in the airwaves?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1851.865,1856.334,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Court has previously had occasion to recognize--"
1989.89-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.334,1859.336,"Well, I... I was asking you if... if that was the Commission's assumption."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1859.336,1859.686,"--Yes, sir."
1989.89-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.907,1868.811,"Now, is... is... what is the reasoning behind that so far as the Commission is concerned?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1868.811,1870.277,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.484,1934.386,Let me understand what you mean.
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1949.596,1958.869,Congress' opponents in this litigation have understood the position to be that all members of a group think in one way.
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.102,1996.994,"The Harvard plan was adopted long before black admissions were an issue, and many thought that the reasons for its adoption was to... was to eliminate the excessive number of Jewish students who were getting admitted on a purely merit basis."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1996.994,1997.944,--But I referred to it--
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.944,1999.529,"So, I... I'm not very impressed with--"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,1999.529,2010.151,"--I refer to it, Justice Scalia, only for the purpose of telling you that the policy does not rest on a judgment that all members of a group think in the same way."
1989.89-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2010.151,2024.477,"--Well, in your view, then, could the FCC require that every broadcast station in the United States devote one hour a week to minority... the expression of minority views?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2024.477,2025.763,"Justice Kennedy, the--"
1989.89-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.763,2027.346,Assuming we can define that.
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2027.346,2050.478,"--the Commission and Congress in their consideration of alternatives are limited both by renewal expectancy considerations and by First Amendment considerations, and this Court in the case about 10 years ago... it was involving cable, but the Court spoke to broadcasting as well and said that there are concerns in Section 3(h) of the Communications Act."
1989.89-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2066.673,2070.375,"So, it can do... so it can do so indirectly what it can't do directly?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2070.375,2079.481,"--Well, we do attempt through structural regulations to achieve the public interest in programming content without direct content regulation."
1989.89-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2081.181,2084.885,But... but you're trying to achieve content regulation nonetheless?
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2084.885,2108.933,"--Well, there's no question that this judgment believes that if there are more minority owners... it's a nominally structural regulation... but if there are more minority owners, when all is said and done at some point in the future, the public will have received a diversity of expression that it will not have received if we do not have the minorities."
1989.89-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2110.533,2117.023,"Well, can... can... can non-minority owners offer programs of a diverse nature?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2117.023,2119.189,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, certainly."
1989.89-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.189,2128.295,And can the FCC take action to evaluate the extent to which that is now being done?
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2128.295,2130.413,Your question has two thoughts.
1989.89-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2177.594,2186.75,Has the FCC assessed the extent to which the broadcasting today presents diverse viewpoints?
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2186.75,2189.266,"--Justice O'Connor, two thoughts."
1989.89-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2190.118,2191.368,"I mean, has it or hasn't it?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2191.368,2194.237,"--No, we have not, because it would be improper for us to do so."
1989.89-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2230.01,2230.777,So... so you're trying to--
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2233.981,2236.464,--And the First Amendment would present very difficult--
1989.89-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2236.464,2245.27,"And if it can't be done, then how do you ever evaluate whether the remedy you have prescribed has been met."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2246.121,2247.255,--The focus--
1989.89-453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2247.255,2249.156,--it puts us in quite a dilemma.
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2249.156,2252.775,"--The focus is on ownership, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2253.792,2267.868,"Well, to... to say at the time that the TV 9 decision came down in 1973 or whenever it was that you can't... you're not certain about how to validate predictive judgment, but after 18 years I would think it would not longer be a predictive judgment."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2270.07,2283.062,"Well, the one thing we can evaluate... I don't think, Mr. Chief Justice, that we should be standing before you today and looking at the content and saying look at the content here and look at what it was in 1970 and see, there's more diversity."
1989.89-453,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2302.208,2311.564,"And you're doing that to accomplish a goal which you think is so constitutionally sensitive, you think it's even inappropriate for you to measure it directly?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2311.564,2316.449,"I believe that we are saying, Justice Kennedy, that it is necessary in this area."
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.333,2346.57,"Mr. Armstrong, how do you... how do you pick out these... these particular minorities?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2380.506,2381.875,The Congress came up with the groups.
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.875,2382.358,Yes.
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2382.358,2385.843,And the Commission has accepted what Congress did in the lottery sense.
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.843,2386.862,"Oh, I see."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2386.862,2390.331,And the groups are not unique to this particular case.
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2401.337,2403.089,How were the groups determined?
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2408.943,2415.362,"Congress has identified the groups that it believed have been the victims of discrimination, society-wide discrimination."
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.062,2416.714,"Well, wait."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2420.85,2429.122,"--Well, this is where the case... we said it didn't involve a purely remedial case, but it involves in part the remedial aspect because Congress--"
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.122,2435.26,You identified the groups on the basis of a remedial theory in order to achieve a diversity objective.
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2436.126,2453.054,"--In identifying the groups that the Congress believed the public most needed to hear from the Congress said, given our wealth of experiencing in broadcasting, given our wealth of involvement with civil rights litigation, we believe the groups, the public most needs to hear from are those groups that have been the victims of discrimination."
1989.89-453,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.877,2463.26,I see.
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2479.203,2484.957,"The... obviously we had to refer, Justice White, to the past because that is how Congress decided who should be in the picture."
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.957,2485.725,Do you... do you--
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2485.725,2486.875,"But, no, sir, we are relying in this case--"
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.875,2488.092,--On... on diversification?
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2488.092,2495.164,--the forward-looking purpose to achieve a diversity of expression for the benefit of the public.
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.164,2507.222,"And we shouldn't even address, I suppose... at least we shouldn't accept any submission that this program is... is justifiable based on a remedial basis?"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2507.222,2511.96,The Court would not have to in this case hold that--
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.96,2519.797,"We can't... we can't... if you didn't rely on it, we shouldn't accept any submission based on the remedy."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2519.797,2525.1,"--Well, I... I think it's clear from the... the Court has to decide whether what Congress did is lawful, but it's clear what Congress has in mind."
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.223,2535.658,"Yeah, but that isn't what the FCC has done."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2535.658,2538.041,"--But this is Congress now, Justice White, that's acted."
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.049,2557.239,"Well, I know, but all Congress said that here's... that you don't want to change... that it didn't want you to change your... your preference policy."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2565.76,2571.581,"When they said that, Justice White, they did refer to the 1982 lottery statute."
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.902,2584.489,"--I know, but Congress didn't change... Congress didn't change the basis that... on which you're acting."
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2584.489,2591.126,"The amicus brief of the Senate... no, sir, they didn't change the basis on which we had acted, but we have been acting since '82--"
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.126,2593.595,"Well, you've been acting on a diversification basis--"
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2593.595,2594.195,--Yes.
1989.89-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.195,2596.447,--not a race remedy basis.
1989.89-453,1,20501,daniel_m_armstrong,,2596.447,2603.802,"But I believe as in Fullilove the earlier statute is relevant, and the earlier statute indicates that Congress also had the remedial purpose in mind."
1989.89-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.802,2606.837,"Thank you, Mr. Armstrong."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2622.431,2629.501,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2704.851,2712.941,"Ms. Polivy, are you suggesting that the First Amendment requires the FCC's diversification program?"
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2712.941,2742.626,"--Your Honor, the... this Court and many others and Congress have had occasion over the years, starting with the Associated Press case and going unbroken for almost 50 years, of acknowledging the fact that the First Amendment is certainly part of the Commission's requirement to diversify the ownership of broadcasting, and it's through the ownership of broadcasting that editorial control takes place."
1989.89-453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2742.626,2751.649,"Well, are you saying that this Court has held that the FCC must... the First Amendment requires the FCC to follow a diversification--"
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2751.649,2767.009,"I think the question would come up in the... in the reverse, that the FCC's foundation, reliance upon the First Amendment as part of its reason for diversity, is an appropriate First Amendment finding."
1989.89-453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.11,2774.479,"--Well, but what is an appropriate First Amendment finding?"
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2774.479,2792.476,"Well, that diversification is part of the First Amendment, that the multiplicity of tongues and the encouragement of diversity in the control of media is something that the Commission properly sees as its function under the Communications Act and under the First Amendment."
1989.89-453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2792.476,2801.765,"But now that's quite different, to say that the Commission sees that as its function under the Communications Act and that this Court has upheld its seeing it that way."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2809.836,2811.437,I don't think the Court has ever said that.
1989.89-453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.97,2812.587,"No, I don't, either."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2812.587,2824.428,"--I think the Court has said that this is consistent with the Commission's obligation both to further the First Amendment and the Communications Act, and I think that's all that I'm claiming there."
1989.89-453,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2886.486,2917.207,"Under the Commission's rationale, I take it, if there's a community with a substantial Hispanic population, an Asian owner of the applicant gets the race preference under the FCC statute, or must there be some parallel between the composition of the local community and the particular minority being given the preference?"
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2917.207,2934.251,"Justice Kennedy, the... the underlying rationale of the... the policy is that the people who are to benefit from the inclusion of multiple voices are not the minority groups involved but the population as a whole."
1989.89-453,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2934.251,2935.935,"Well, my question was how... my question is how does it work?"
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2935.935,2943.107,The way it works is very simply there is no consideration given to whether this is an Asian population or a Hispanic population.
1989.89-453,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2944.824,2956.849,So there's no... so there's no correlation required between the race of the owners and the racial composition of the community that it serves?
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,2956.849,2957.232,"--No, sir."
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2995.807,3002.313,I thought we're all trying to make money when we... when we buy a for-profit radio or television station.
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3002.313,3003.13,"--Well, we're not--"
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.13,3018.239,"And I thought that the smarter we all are we will all try to make money in exactly the same way, and if we're an Asian broadcasting in a Hispanic community, we will broadcast Hispanic programming, just as we would if we were a white broadcasting in a Hispanic community."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3018.239,3023.726,"--The air waves are a public domain, and broadcasters are public trustees."
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.92,3078.73,"What evidence... what evidence can you refer to that demonstrates that individuals of any of these particular race, or of any race for that matter, will produce programming of a particular racial type?"
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3078.73,3088.669,"There have been some studies, and in the brief filed by the NAACP there... there is a footnote that extensively refers to them, but that is not the point."
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.226,3111.617,"I thought the concept was also, however, that people's voices... that is, their ideas... are not to be judged on the basis of their skin."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3115.153,3120.89,"--Certainly, it is, and we are not saying that the content of their voices underlies the--"
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.89,3122.523,But that's exactly what you're saying.
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3122.523,3123.009,--I think--
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.009,3127.144,"You're saying that if you have black owners you will have black programming, whatever that means."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3127.144,3127.994,--I am not saying that.
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.115,3166.586,A black who gets a minority preference here could have been born and raised in Scarsdale; isn't that right?
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3166.586,3167.288,Certainly.
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.288,3169.538,"You're saying our background, where we come from."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3173.09,3173.524,"No, it--"
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3173.524,3174.624,Isn't blood what counts?
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3174.624,3175.192,--It has--
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.192,3177.309,What counts for purposes of whether the preference is given?
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3181.111,3184.897,"--Well, if you... if you mean belonging to a group by blood--"
1989.89-453,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3184.897,3186.199,That's what I mean.
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3186.199,3187.415,--I would say yes.
1989.89-453,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3208.798,3212.233,"And who you are is your race, under your view... in the Commission's view?"
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3212.233,3213.767,"Well, it may be your ethnicity."
1989.89-453,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3385.896,3389.098,"Of course, I take it diversity of views is a constant goal."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3412.012,3415.766,--Diversity of views is certainly a rationale that is permanent.
1989.89-453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3525.554,3526.837,"Thank you, Ms. Polivy."
1989.89-453,2,36465,margaret_polivy,,3526.837,3527.423,--Thank you.
1989.89-453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3527.423,3529.006,"Mr. Guillot, do you have any rebuttal?"
1989.89-453,3,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,3531.875,3532.675,"Oh, my gosh."
1989.89-453,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3663.294,3666.913,"May I ask, how do we know the next group of commissioners is going to follow the same policy?"
1989.89-453,3,25340,gregory_h_guillot,,3666.913,3680.821,"Your Honor, given the appropriations acts, we will never know even what the Commission's true viewpoint is because the Commission has been statutorily restricted to express only one view regarding the policies, and that is a pro-constitutional one."
1989.89-453,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3680.821,3682.337,"Thank you, Mr. Guillot."
