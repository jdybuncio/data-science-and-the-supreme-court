1984.83-1032,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.308,We'll hear arguments next in the Federal Election Commission against the National Conservative Political Action Committee and the related case.
1984.83-1032,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,15.426,19.728,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,50.266,51.966,"I have one question, Mr. Steele."
1984.83-1032,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,60.222,75.814,"We do not consider that it is, because as we read the statute it seems to us that, though there is jurisdiction in the FEC to raise those issues, that the question in the statutory construction, that Congress did not intend private parties to be suing each other, is the same issue."
1984.83-1032,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.658,199.36,From the corrosive effects of public financing?
1984.83-1032,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,199.36,201.61,"Private financing, excuse me."
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1315.772,1318.808,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1351.945,1353.314,It's a mistake.
1984.83-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.485,1378.697,"In the Right to Work Committee decision of the Court a couple years ago, which did deal with the prohibition against corporations and unions, that case went off on the proposition that corporations have always been treated differently for purposes of political expenditures since way, way back than individuals have."
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1382.751,1397.86,"--Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think if you go back and look through the NRWC case, the rationale for why corporations have always been treated differently is their ability to aggregate wealth and to use the corporate form."
1984.83-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1407.299,1414.02,"Well, to the extent you're dealing with the corporate form, you can probably get them under the section involved in NRWC, can't you?"
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1414.02,1427.445,"No, because that section does not... would not pertain here, inasmuch as under a Federal Election Commission regulation they have registered as a political committee and thereby have taken themselves out from underneath 441(b)."
1984.83-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.455,1461.867,"Well, certainly none of the arguments, at least in reading Judge Becker's opinion in the district court, suggest that all of these defendants were corporations and that they should be subjected to the corporate restrictions in the Act."
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1461.867,1467.004,I think it is clear from the record that both of the Appellees are corporations.
1984.83-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1474.657,1480.144,"Well, but Judge Pecker distinguished NRWC in his opinion on the ground that it dealt with corporations."
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1484.013,1485.882,I don't believe that is correct.
1984.83-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.908,1735.86,"Well, why is that... why is one to be preferred over another for First Amendment purposes?"
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1735.86,1740.348,I don't suggest for a second that one is to be preferred over the other for First Amendment purposes.
1984.83-1032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.094,1778.454,"A lot of that line of analysis was followed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Buckley against Valeo, and squarely rejected by this Court... the idea that you enhance First Amendment values by subduing some people's speech and increasing other people's speech."
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1778.454,1788.829,"Well, I think in that case what the Court was focusing on, what this Court focused on, was the subduing of the speech of the rich versus the poor or Easterners versus Westerners."
1984.83-1032,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1894.514,1897.799,"Well, I think it's more than a contribution right, isn't it?"
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1916.094,1918.796,And I think that that was true in Buckley.
1984.83-1032,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.726,1948.915,"Well, I suppose Congress could regulate the extent to which committees must require participation, but it hasn't chosen to do that."
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1948.915,1958.937,"--Well, the point would be that if the committees required significant participation then it would be likely to come out from underneath the definition, because it would be more like a--"
1984.83-1032,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.937,1963.323,"But be that as it may, that is a subject that Congress could regulate, presumably?"
1984.83-1032,1,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1963.323,1965.275,--That's correct.
1984.83-1032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1969.661,1972.53,Mr. Sparks.
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,1972.53,1976.248,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1032,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.985,2138.937,"This is a statutory argument, I take it?"
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2138.937,2140.12,"It is, Your Honor."
1984.83-1032,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.12,2143.239,And what did the district court say to you about that?
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2143.239,2148.143,"Your Honor, I made this argument in my papers, but I did not in oral argument before the district court."
1984.83-1032,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.143,2150.578,Then the district court didn't address it?
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2150.578,2151.828,"It did not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1032,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.928,2157.566,And you're making an alternative argument for affirmance?
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2157.566,2157.849,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-1032,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.201,2165.338,"I would think the district court would have had to reach the statutory argument first, if you presented it."
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2165.338,2172.576,"I presented it in my papers, but not in argument, Your Honor."
1984.83-1032,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.066,2311.949,May I just ask this.
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2320.255,2337.649,"We believe that it now reaches, that it was intended to reach, only party-connected expenditures for a candidate on his behalf or those that were otherwise somehow coordinated with him, at his request or suggestion."
1984.83-1032,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.287,2641.577,Isn't it possible to at least infer from the debates that Congress was concerned about corruption when it passed 9012(f)?
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2641.577,2646.731,"It was indeed concerned about corruption arising from contributions, Your Honor, not from independent expenditures."
1984.83-1032,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.041,2761.419,"Well, if the appearance of corruption is a valid purpose, something against which Congress may legislate, why can't the appearance of corruption be determined by a plebiscite?"
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2780.464,2789.903,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, it's my understanding that the way Congress would find such corruption, the proper way, would be for it to hold public hearings and take testimony."
1984.83-1032,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2796.723,2799.592,Like testimony from a pollster?
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2799.592,2801.192,--For instance.
1984.83-1032,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.192,2802.377,Yes.
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2802.377,2803.311,We didn't have our poll.
1984.83-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.413,2807.063,"Yes, exactly."
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2811.666,2812.849,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1984.83-1032,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2841.169,2851.025,"Would you reject, then, completely as a valid goal the preservation of public confidence in the integrity of elections?"
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2851.025,2852.809,"No, ma'am, I would not."
1984.83-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2911.265,2915.734,Are the names of the donors required to be disclosed?
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2915.734,2917.669,"Yes, Your Honor, donors to--"
1984.83-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2917.669,2919.086,In the report to the Commission?
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2919.086,2920.871,"--Yes, Your Honor; not just gross amounts."
1984.83-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.871,2922.421,No matter what the amount is?
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2922.421,2923.256,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2927.025,2927.825,I think there was a bottom limit.
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2927.825,2935.297,"--There's a $50 or a $200 threshold, below which I don't think the donors' names must be disclosed."
1984.83-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2935.297,2953.192,"Has there ever been any study made by Congress or by anyone, a public study, as to the coordination or the incidence of donors to both the independent committee and a party committee?"
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2953.192,2954.292,If there is I'm not aware of one.
1984.83-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2954.292,2957.894,"That would be evidence of coordination, I suppose?"
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,2957.894,2961.781,Similarity of contributors?
1984.83-1032,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2988.015,3006.06,"Well, if you concede that the statutory construction argument is resolved against you, at least for purposes of this argument, and say that Congress did go further here, I think you have to admit that Congress thought it was necessary to go further than the other means that you say you think are perfectly adequate."
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,3006.06,3009.762,"Your Honor, let me hasten to say that I didn't intend to concede that--"
1984.83-1032,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.762,3022.586,"No, all I meant was that when you argue about the extent of the statute here and going further than necessary, you necessarily assume that the statutory construction argument is resolved differently than you say it should be."
1984.83-1032,2,40552,robert_r_sparks_jr,,3022.586,3025.021,"--All right, Your Honor."
1984.83-1032,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3290.462,3291.897,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Steele?"
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3294.933,3300.318,I would like first to deal with the issue of the statutory interpretation.
1984.83-1032,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3510.173,3513.125,"Mr. Steele, may I interrupt just a minute?"
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3526.016,3527.199,--Local radio.
1984.83-1032,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3527.199,3527.885,Locally?
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3527.885,3530.035,"Local radio, one of the things set forth--"
1984.83-1032,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3530.035,3533.52,How much advertising can you buy for $150?
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3533.52,3538.324,--The record has a great deal of evidence that was put in precisely with regard to that point.
1984.83-1032,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3538.324,3541.209,Is that in your brief or just in the record?
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3541.209,3555.468,"I think it's referred to in our brief in the summation, but the printed appendix... not only in the record, it was printed in the appendix, and it's in the stipulation of facts as to the amount of advertising that an individual by himself could buy."
1984.83-1032,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3572.414,3575.782,What would be the dimensions of a $100 ad in the New York Times?
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3575.782,3577.599,"--Very small, if they'd take it."
1984.83-1032,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3577.599,3578.151,Could you find it?
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3578.151,3579.301,No question.
1984.83-1032,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3668.172,3673.576,Let me try another hypothetical on you that I think has some historical background.
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3729.596,3730.396,I think it can.
1984.83-1032,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3737.233,3742.054,My hypothetical is that this third party fellow didn't get any public funding.
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3743.672,3748.79,"I think that, yes, I think it would be an extraordinary situation that would make the court go behind it."
1984.83-1032,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3758.598,3761.467,What section of the statute would you rely on for that?
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3761.467,3767.102,"I would say that that would be an interpretation of the statutory language that's involved in this section, Section 9012(f)."
1984.83-1032,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3782.88,3794.605,"Well, a good many people would think that some of the third party candidates were injected and supported for precisely the reason I set up in my hypothetical in the past."
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3797.39,3801.925,"No, and I don't mean to say that I don't think that there are difficulties involved in that."
1984.83-1032,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3815.619,3821.106,"Could the Commission get at that before the election, or only by a criminal proceeding after the election?"
1984.83-1032,3,20154,charles_n_steele,,3821.106,3833.496,"As always, in the short space of the general election, one of the reasons that we would see this as a statute is that it's very difficult for the Commission to get at that in the space before the election."
1984.83-1032,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3833.496,3834.463,"Thank you, gentlemen."
