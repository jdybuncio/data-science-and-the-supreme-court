2019.19-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.96,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 19-67, United States versus Sineneng-Smith. Mr. Feigin."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,7.96,21.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent acknowledges that in the context of a criminal law, the terms ""encourage"" and ""induce"" can refer solely to acts that facilitate or solicit unlawful activity."
2019.19-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,135.4,142.8,"You -- you would acknowledge, though, that there are situations in which this would be unconstitutional as applied?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,142.8,157.08,"Your Honor, I -- I suppose there might be some circumstances where this could be unconstitutional as -- as applied. I don't know that anyone's identified any actual such applications that the statute would reach --"
2019.19-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,157.08,158.32,"Well, let's suppose --"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,158.32,159.48,-- under our reading.
2019.19-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,159.48,176.32,"-- you know, a grandmother whose granddaughter is in the United States illegally, tells the granddaughter, you know, I hope you will stay because, you know, I will miss you, things will not get better if you go back, so I encourage you to stay."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,176.88,177.04,Well --
2019.19-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,177.04,181.2,"-- that -- that would be illegal under the statute, right?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,181.2,196.36,"-- it would not be illegal under the statute, Your Honor, and here's why: First of all, the issue of when verbal acts or other acts cross the line into criminal complicity or solicitation is not a -- an issue unique to this statute."
2019.19-67,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.08,249.84,There was -- there was a decision that Circuit Judge Tashima cited -- I think it was a district court in Massachusetts -- in which he said that that was an instance where this statute was applied to encroach on First Amendment rights.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,249.84,260.44,"So, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't think Judge Tashima thought that that particular prosecution, which was not subject to a First Amendment challenge itself, was in violation of the First Amendment."
2019.19-67,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,292.16,292.36,What --
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,292.36,292.84,In fact --
2019.19-67,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,292.84,293.48,-- what about a --
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,293.48,293.8,I'm sorry.
2019.19-67,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,293.8,301.52,What about a charity? So a charity provides food to someone who's in the country unlawfully.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,301.52,307.72,"So, first of all, Your Honor, I think that would be conduct rather than speech, so I don't think it would factor into the overbreadth analysis."
2019.19-67,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,307.72,309.44,Is it covered under this statute?
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,309.44,329.44,"So, if a charity were to give out food to people that the charity knew or recklessly disregarded were in the country unlawfully on the same terms that it gives out food to other needy people, then -- then no, Your Honor. Furthermore, I think, in interpreting the statute, it's important to remember that it's part of the Immigration and Nationality --"
2019.19-67,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,329.44,339.4,What if it's not on the same terms; it's designed to provide food for people who can't get it elsewhere and they know that the people taking advantage of that are here unlawfully?
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,339.4,346.64,"So, Your Honor, there is no explicit exception in the -- in the statute for activities that are denominated as charitable."
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,402.6,450.76,"Mr. Feigin, but it has been used, according to the Amnesty International brief, and DHS admitted that there was a watch list at the border in which these charitable organizations, people who were giving legal advice at the border, all sorts of individuals were being watched because they potentially violated this encouragement provision and inducement provision. So you're saying there's been no absolute -- there's been no prosecution except Henderson, which was a -- a woman who hired a housekeeper who told her the absolute truth: If you go back, you -- you're not -- if you go -- if you return to your country, you may not get back."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,466.28,483.72,"Well, Your Honor, let me take those two examples in turn. First of all, the Amnesty International letter, if you look at it, the DHS conduct in that case was focused on investigating instances of violence against border patrol agents and suspicions that people were being counseled to lie to immigration officials."
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,499.04,521.56,"Could I ask one question? If this lawyer had sincerely believed, because, in fact, it was true or close to the truth, if she just got it wrong, that there was a lawful program that these individuals could have accessed to keep them here, would you have been able to prosecute her?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,521.56,522.96,"No, Your Honor, we couldn't have."
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,525.84,527.88,May I just interrupt you one second?
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,527.88,528.92,Sure.
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,528.92,535.72,"You could -- you did prosecute her for fraud, for fraudulently telling her clients that they were eligible for this, correct?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,535.72,541.04,"Your Honor, to be -- to be clear, the defendant in Henderson was not a lawyer and not someone counseling clients."
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,541.04,541.8,I'm not talking about him.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,543.84,546.04,"Oh, we prosecuted -- oh, I'm sorry."
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,547.32,547.84,Yes.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,547.84,551.76,"Yes, we -- we -- she was not acting as a lawyer, although she is a lawyer."
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,573.56,580.84,So please tell me what the different penalty is for those fraud convictions as opposed to a conviction under this statute.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,580.84,585.0,"You -- you -- do you mean a conviction under the mail fraud statute, Your Honor?"
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,585.0,589.04,Under the mail fraud statute versus a conviction under this immigration statute.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,591.8,612.0,"So the mail fraud statute, I believe, has a statutory range of zero to 20 years of imprisonment, and under this statute, it was zero to 10, I believe, because of the financial gain element. I would emphasize that the fact that this particular conduct may be covered by two different provisions is, first of all, happenstance."
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,617.16,636.8,"But let's go back to my original question, which let's say this program was a path, but they were still here unlawfully. Can you read the words of the statute to me that tell me that she wouldn't be prosecuted for encouraging or inducing them to stay while they went for the lawful path?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,636.8,654.4,"So, Your Honor, we don't think it is encouragement or inducement knowing or in reckless disregard of the alien's unlawful status to either advise them of the existence of or help someone to apply for a lawful government program. And let me explain why."
2019.19-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,696.88,697.24,Isn't --
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,697.24,701.16,"The Immigration and Nationality Act -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
2019.19-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.16,704.04,"You said that point, which is a good point."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,785.24,790.6,"Well, Your Honor, it is a crime to be found in the United States following removal, for example."
2019.19-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,796.48,796.76,Okay.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,801.0,801.28,Well --
2019.19-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,801.28,846.08,"What we do is we take Professor Volokh's brief and we say that the statute under constitutional pressure is limited to instances with all the qualifications you've given, there are several there, but the main one is it is -- it is limited to solicitation of a crime. So it is only in the instance that there is a repeat, and the person has to know it and the person who's doing it, a repeat of coming several times or twice to the United States and then, what you just said, and entering several times, you know, and we put that into it, and does that -- does the government accept that?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,846.08,847.36,"Well, Your Honor, we would certainly --"
2019.19-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,847.36,852.2,It would be an alternative in my mind possibly that all the horribles apply and forget the statute part of it.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,852.2,863.76,"Well, Your Honor, we would certainly prefer that to the alternative of the Ninth Circuit's kind of novel overbreadth invalidation, but I don't think that's -- I don't think that remedy is necessary."
2019.19-67,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,923.44,923.72,But what -- what this --
2019.19-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,923.72,932.0,"He doesn't say that. He -- he -- he really -- I mean, we couldn't even find one, a case, where -- where of course that makes a huge difference."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,945.48,947.32,"Well, let -- let me give you a few examples, Your Honor."
2019.19-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,967.04,967.04,Okay.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1015.48,1036.12,"Well, Your Honor, I think there's a reason that we haven't seen that in the many decades, indeed, about 150 years that a statute like this has been on the books. And the reason why they can't document any instances of it and the reason why their amici are all advocacy groups that engage daily in the very activities they claim are chilled."
2019.19-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1036.12,1037.52,What exactly --
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1037.52,1038.0,Mister --
2019.19-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1038.0,1049.16,"-- do you think ""encourage"" means? Are -- are there -- is it your position that speech alone can never constitute a violation of this statute, that there always has to be conduct in addition to the speech?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1049.16,1050.0,"No, Your Honor."
2019.19-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1062.32,1065.08,"And what does it mean, specifically what does it mean in this statute?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1065.08,1074.92,"So, in this statute, we think it -- it's not entirely clear whether ""encourage"" is the one that covers solicitation or it's the one that covers complicity."
2019.19-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1078.68,1080.08,Take them together.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1080.08,1081.72,-- as kind of a package deal.
2019.19-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1081.72,1082.08,Fine.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1083.0,1090.64,We think that it means that you have to substantially participate in the activity as something that the defendant wishes to bring about or to succeed.
2019.19-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1090.64,1092.56,"Well, that's aiding and abetting."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1092.56,1097.48,"It's -- it's different from aiding and abetting in, I think, three distinct ways."
2019.19-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1170.72,1183.2,"So, if the -- if the defendant just says, well, I encourage you to stay here, that might not be enough, but, if the defendant says it 10 times in a forceful voice, that would be a violation?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1183.2,1210.52,"I don't think that kind of more abstract attenuated exhortation is really going to satisfy this particular statute. One additional reason why -- one additional reason why we think some substantial participation is required is because this is coming in clause iv of a five-clause statute. And if you look at clauses i through iii, which cover the other kinds of substantive conduct here, all of them require some sort of substantial participation --"
2019.19-67,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1210.52,1242.44,"But what do you mean by ""substantial participation""? Because I didn't really take that from your brief, so I'm a little bit confused as to where that's coming from. And, again, what Justice Alito said, I mean, if somebody says I really think you should stay here, here are the 10 reasons why, and repeats that and repeats that, and it's -- it's very definitely encouraging and inducing a person to stay in this country, does that count as substantial participation, or is there some non-speech conduct that has to be added to the mix?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1242.44,1271.04,"Well, Your Honor, I think there are occasions in the criminal law where words can constitute aiding and abetting, and I think that the same is true under this statute. If the Court were to have a problem with that, it could either be addressed through as-applied challenges, as the Chief Justice has mentioned, or, again, we would prefer, to the Ninth Circuit's remedy, something that says that it has to be accompanied -- an interpretation that says that it has to be accompanied by some conduct."
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1271.6,1272.48,Mr. Feigin --
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1272.48,1272.76,Yes.
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1272.76,1282.56,"-- Mr. Feigin, I -- I -- I just want to give you a shot before your time is up, and -- and I -- I -- I take your point there, such as it is, but two -- two things."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1329.72,1336.2,"Well, Your Honor, below we resisted a mens rea of willfully, which would require some specific --"
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1336.2,1336.76,"Yeah, purpose."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1336.76,1342.48,"No, some specific -- having specifically in mind the -- a specific purpose to violate the law."
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1342.48,1344.2,"The violation of law, yeah."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1344.6,1360.72,"We do think this requires the same mens rea that this Court described in Rosemond, where the Court said that participation in a crime with knowledge of the attendant circumstances, although this would extend to reckless disregard of the attendant circumstances, would satisfy the normal --"
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1360.72,1361.88,And that's what I guess I'm --
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1361.88,1362.6,-- criminal complicity --
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1362.6,1389.8,"-- I'm getting at, is that if you -- if recklessness is good enough, so I could be in my speech -- and this gets even beyond the specific versus how -- the conduct and how specific the exhortation has to be, but I could be reckless in my speech in encouraging somebody and -- and wind up a federal criminal even though the underlying violation is merely civil."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1391.48,1392.48,"No, Your Honor."
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1396.44,1397.6,"No, I'm recklessly --"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1397.6,1397.84,-- about the law.
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1397.84,1412.52,"-- I'm recklessly indifferent to my granddaughter's status and I'm recklessly encouraging, exhorting her, in whatever level of specificity you require, but I have no intention of -- of violating the -- the immigration laws."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1418.56,1419.52,So --
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1419.52,1420.88,Then what?
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1420.88,1423.16,"-- Your Honor, two -- two parts of that."
2019.19-67,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1442.4,1463.32,"I guess what I'm -- I'm wondering here, Mr. Feigin, at the end of it all and just to cut to the chase is, does the government think that -- that the common law principles of secondary liability that normally try and prevent the dragnet effect of secondary liability from extending too far inform the First Amendment analysis here, or would you just have us blow past all of those guideposts?"
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1463.32,1473.24,"Well, Your Honor, we do think the statute should be interpreted in conformity with the normal criminal law principles of accomplice liability and solicitation that the Court has long recognized apply to these as a matter --"
2019.19-67,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1473.24,1473.68,But the problem is -- and this is --
2019.19-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.68,1475.92,Do you agree with Professor Volokh or do you not?
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1475.92,1484.48,"Your Honor, I do not agree, or we do not agree, with Professor Volokh's suggestion in his brief that this needs to be limited to criminal activity."
2019.19-67,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1493.8,1494.88,Mr. Feigin --
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1494.88,1495.36,-- with the Court of --
2019.19-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1495.36,1525.72,"I don't know where -- I don't know where Professor Volokh got this idea, but there are situations in which a person -- in which the -- the commission of the -- of the offense that is encouraged is not made criminal because of the vulnerable position of the person who is engaging in that act, but it doesn't necessarily follow that encouraging that person to do the thing cannot be made criminal."
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1525.72,1527.36,I think that's exactly right.
2019.19-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.6,1529.76,Very briefly.
2019.19-67,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1529.76,1530.0,Yeah.
2019.19-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1537.4,1544.04,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fleming."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1544.04,1548.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd begin with two points."
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1679.2,1680.28,"Well, on -- on this point --"
2019.19-67,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1680.28,1692.8,"Mr. Feigin, was there anything in this statute -- this is little iv, and the earlier parts of the statute, i, ii, and iii."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1707.52,1713.12,"So, to answer the question, Justice Ginsburg, and then I'll address the premise."
2019.19-67,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.4,1777.36,There was one count -- there were five counts.
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1788.52,1794.36,There were -- so there were three people who were -- three non-citizens who were offered as potential victims.
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1809.64,1812.64,"On Professor Volokh's point, it's an interesting point."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1856.36,1859.2,"So I -- I don't think that it would be protected, Justice Alito."
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1859.2,1859.36,Why?
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1859.36,1859.76,I think that --
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1859.76,1873.12,What is -- why -- why would that be? So doesn't that defeat the argument that you can never -- someone can never be convicted of speech that encourages an activity that is not criminal?
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1873.12,1877.64,"No, I think -- I think incitement to suicide would fall within the Brandenburg exception."
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1892.4,1893.12,"Well, it's not --"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1893.12,1894.12,-- by the First Amendment.
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1894.12,1894.68,-- it's not a crime today.
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1894.68,1895.28,"No, not today."
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1895.28,1900.12,And why would this -- why does this not qualify under Brandenburg?
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1900.12,1901.84,Why does it not qualify?
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1901.84,1907.64,Why would encouraging someone to remain in the country illegally not qualify under Brandenburg?
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1907.64,1921.12,"I -- first of all, I don't think that's an argument the government is making, and I think for good reason. Brandenburg generally applies -- only allows regulation of incitement to immediate lawless activity and arguably violent lawless activity --"
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1921.12,1921.88,"Well, okay, if it's limited to --"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1921.88,1923.48,-- which in this instance is not going to cause harm.
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1923.48,1928.04,"-- if it's limited to violent activity, that would be -- that would be a limitation."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1942.76,1952.76,"I -- and I think that's a -- that's another distinction from the suicide case that I was going to get to, is most state laws that prohibit the solicitation of suicide have a causation requirement."
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1971.28,1971.44,Isn't it --
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1971.44,1973.48,-- because that's not how this jury was instructed.
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1973.48,1986.88,-- isn't it odd to think of somebody encouraging somebody to do something if the person who's doing the encouraging does not intend for the person to do that thing? Isn't that built into the concept of encouragement?
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1986.88,1990.76,"If it were, Justice Alito, then the jury should have been accordingly instructed."
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2003.96,2004.24,Well --
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2004.24,2004.88,But on page 50 --
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2004.88,2014.84,"-- and that might be a reason for reversing the conviction for improper instructions to the jury, but I don't know that it's a ground for holding that the statute is unconstitutional."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2014.84,2030.4,"Well, I -- I would say at the very least, if the Court were to rewrite the statute either in the way the government put forward in its brief or in the way that Mr. Feigin is now suggesting for the first time now, there would at the very least need to be a remand for a new trial under the new statute asserted by the government."
2019.19-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2030.4,2044.32,"Before you leave this, I don't know if this can be done, honestly don't, but, I mean, in thinking of the -- of the Volokh brief and the rewriting, you -- you -- all you -- one thing you do is it says violation of law."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2047.72,2048.16,You would.
2019.19-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.16,2052.28,And you imply criminal law in order to avoid the constitutional thing.
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2105.4,2110.2,"So my reaction, Justice Breyer, is, first of all, if Your Honor were to do that, my client gets acquitted."
2019.19-67,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2211.6,2212.0,Counsel --
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2212.0,2217.88,"If the statute, just to be clear, if the statute said aid, abet or solicit, that would be constitutional?"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2217.88,2222.12,"It would not, Justice Kavanaugh, because of the civil/criminal issue we've been discussing."
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2228.8,2235.44,"If we didn't -- if we didn't agree with you on that point, would -- and it said aid, abet or solicit, would it then be constitutional?"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2235.44,2237.64,I -- I still don't think it would be because --
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2237.64,2238.16,Why not?
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2238.16,2247.4,"Well, because you are talking about a statute that singles out one particular category of civil violations for -- for criminal solicitation liability."
2019.19-67,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2265.16,2266.08,Mr. Fleming --
2019.19-67,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2266.08,2266.8,Counsel -- sorry.
2019.19-67,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2266.8,2278.56,"-- I -- I -- I go back to an example that was given earlier by Justice Breyer, but there is a statute which has to do with employers hiring illegal aliens."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2303.0,2303.44,So the --
2019.19-67,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2303.44,2314.88,"They can't -- you know, they have to provide a Social Security card and all of this other stuff, and those acts are going to make them criminally liable, but certainly not the act of being employed."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2314.88,2322.52,I -- I think those fall under the -- the also recognized prohibition on offers to engage in transactions that are themselves banned.
2019.19-67,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2330.56,2333.16,Is that your answer to the prostitution case? Why the --
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2333.16,2341.32,"I mean, in -- in some ways, yes, I mean, I think -- because you can decriminalize prostitution, but you can still criminalize paying someone to engage in -- in -- in sex."
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2342.92,2343.28,There are --
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2343.28,2343.44,-- conduct.
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2343.44,2390.52,"-- there are a lot of examples of instances where states have made things illegal -- make it -- makes it illegal to encourage somebody to do something that is not itself illegal involving minors, encouraging a minor to purchase alcohol -- to -- to -- to purchase alcohol or to consume alcohol, or encourage a person of diminished capacity to engage in some kind of dangerous activity. I mean, you're going to do a lot of damage if you accept this distinction that you can never criminalize encouraging a vulnerable person to do something that is not itself illegal on the part of the -- criminal on the part of the person who's encouraged."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2390.52,2393.88,So I don't know of any statute that sweeps as broadly as this one.
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2429.32,2430.16,"Well, let me ask you --"
2019.19-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2430.16,2432.16,But you have to --
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2432.16,2460.44,"-- one more -- one more question that -- about something that seems unusual about your overbreadth argument. Usually, in a free speech overbreadth case, the defendant has engaged in speech, and the defendant says even if my speech is not protected, I can assert free speech claims of other people. But, here, your client was not prosecuted for engaging in speech."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2484.4,2486.92,I think the best example is Coates versus Cincinnati.
2019.19-67,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2529.68,2530.84,"Mr. Fleming, what do we --"
2019.19-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2530.84,2531.2,Can -- can --
2019.19-67,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2531.2,2558.4,"-- what do we do about the fact that there haven't been prosecutions brought of the kind that you talk about? I mean, there's obviously no requirement that that be the case, but there is a view that there has to be a realistic risk of a statute that's overbroad being applied to protected activity. So where does the realistic risk come from in the absence of actual prosecutions that you can point to and say, ah, that went wrong?"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2558.4,2576.36,"I'd like to point to the Henderson case and I'd like to clarify a statement that -- that Mr. Feigin made about it. One of -- this is the case in Boston, where Ms. Henderson was prosecuted, and one of the theories, an independent theory of liability, was that she gave advice to her undocumented housekeeper: If you stay here, they won't let you back."
2019.19-67,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2592.36,2595.76,"Okay, I'll take the point, but broaden it out a little bit in terms of your answers."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2598.04,2599.52,There's at least one that we -- we know of.
2019.19-67,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2599.52,2599.72,Okay.
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2599.72,2600.44,"Yes, that's right."
2019.19-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2693.64,2694.2,What do you --
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2694.2,2695.8,It protects us from these situations.
2019.19-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2695.8,2701.92,"Go back for one second, because I -- I'm taking in your answer to what I asked before."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2746.12,2746.4,Right.
2019.19-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2746.4,2765.0,"We interpret it as Congress picking up, in the government's view, solicitation, the common definition of solicitation, not including the exceptions, et cetera, because this is a common kind of thing, you see, something like that. That's it."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2768.32,2771.76,"I think, Your Honor, if you write that opinion, you'd have to add one more sentence --"
2019.19-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.76,2771.92,Yeah.
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2771.92,2773.2,-- which is the judgment below is affirmed.
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2776.2,2792.68,"-- with one exception or one question, which is the notion that there might be exceptions to the rule that solicitation has to be limited to a solicitation of criminal conduct with specific intent on the part of the defendant that the criminal conduct be committed."
2019.19-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2793.6,2794.68,Would we -- would we --
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2794.68,2795.04,I'm sorry.
2019.19-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2795.04,2798.36,Would we have to get that passed by the Senate and House -- (Laughter.)
2019.19-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2798.36,2803.8,-- and then signed by the President before we could put that -- that many changes to the statute?
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2803.8,2805.36,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.19-67,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2827.64,2833.84,"Would you talk a little bit about that generally? Because, you know, we obviously like to save statutes rather than to kill statutes."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2849.4,2864.4,"I -- I don't think it's possible in this case because all of the textual indicators point in terms -- in the direction of the interpretation that I've been advocating and that the court below took. I think, as a general matter, this Court interprets statutes; it doesn't rewrite them."
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2881.36,2888.4,"But then we would never -- then we would never do a narrowing construction because you would always say, well, just go with what the words of the statute mean."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2888.4,2888.64,No.
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2890.12,2900.52,"When can you do -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's point, when can you do a narrowing construction? You have a broad term, if read literally would be broad. When can you narrow?"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2900.52,2932.56,"I think, as this Court said in Clark versus Martinez, what the Court does is it applies all the standard rules of textual analysis of statutes, not just interpreting a particular word but looking at how it's used in context, looking at the common law background against which Congress legislates, looking at the overall structure of the statute, looking at legislative history sometimes. When all of that has been exhausted, if the Court still thinks that the statute is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible to two different meanings, then constitutional avoidance has some force, and you pick the one that is going to avoid the constitutional avoidance."
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2932.56,2937.52,"Well, when you do all that, you usually have a best interpretation so you don't get to the constitutional avoidance."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2938.68,2938.84,"Often, I --"
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2938.84,2955.08,"I think the problem is can you read the statute to be not the best interpretation but a -- but a second best so as to save the statute, as Justice Kagan says, and -- and not opine too forcefully on the First Amendment limits when you don't have to, to avoid some of Justice Alito's hypotheticals?"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2955.08,2962.92,"Often, one can do that. This is not a case in which I think you can, but I'm -- I'm not here to suggest that constitutional avoidance never works."
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3039.08,3039.56,Mister --
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3039.56,3040.24,-- as the point that --
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3040.24,3041.2,Go ahead.
2019.19-67,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3041.2,3068.16,"Well, Mr. Fleming, could I take you back to the question I asked before, when you gave me the answer that Coates is a case that falls within the category that I mentioned, and you said we didn't know what Coates was doing, but, actually, the opinion says Coates was a student involved in a demonstration and the other appellants were pickets involved in a labor dispute. That is expressive conduct at the very least."
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3080.56,3084.92,"I -- I -- I mean, Coates may have been involved, but I'm not sure what the Court knew in that event."
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3149.16,3161.84,"If Congress wrote a statute that said it is a crime to aid, abet, or solicit certain serious civil offenses, A, B, C, is that law on its face permissible?"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3161.84,3176.44,"I would say not without some proof, because, if we take Stevens seriously, as I think we have to, there would have to be some kind of evidence that the framers, at the time that they wrote the First Amendment, expected that category of speech to be excluded from its ambit."
2019.19-67,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3176.44,3188.64,"If Congress had rewrote it to say it is a crime to aid or abet or solicit certain offenses and then lists -- and makes them crimes, you're okay with that, obviously?"
2019.19-67,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3188.64,3191.32,"I mean, that raises -- that's a harder case."
2019.19-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3254.68,3257.96,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Feigin."
2019.19-67,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3257.96,3295.04,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I take Respondent's principal submission today to be that you simply can't read these words to mean anything other than the incredibly broad reading that Respondent in the Ninth Circuit attribute to them and that's why you can't do constitutional avoidance, but that's simply not true. As Respondent acknowledges on pages 20 to 21 of her brief, these words can, in the context of a criminal complicity provision, at least under the canon of noscitur sociis, have the meaning that we are attributing to them today."
2019.19-67,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3413.52,3414.0,Mr. Feigin --
2019.19-67,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3414.0,3414.84,-- in this case.
2019.19-67,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3414.84,3470.52,"-- what in reading this statute would give an average person notice of all of the limitations you're suggesting to us? Because I read ""encourage or induce an alien to come, enter, or reside in the U.S., knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law,"" seems to me that all of the examples that were raised earlier, the hospital that's treating a child with -- an illegally present child with a disease, the church who provides worship to illegal aliens, all of the other examples that were given on their face to the common reader of those words would be a violation of the statute."
2019.19-67,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3470.52,3484.0,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that is the standard -- I don't think that's the standard this Court applies that someone is ignorant of what those words mean in the context of the criminal law. Again, these are not -- these are not words that are unique to this statute."
2019.19-67,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3494.88,3495.76,But accomplice liability --
2019.19-67,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3495.76,3496.8,"-- ""induce"" in Williams."
2019.19-67,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3496.8,3500.32,-- has all sorts of meaning that you're not endorsing.
2019.19-67,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3506.04,3506.56,"No, Your Honor --"
2019.19-67,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3506.56,3507.76,-- altogether?
2019.19-67,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3507.76,3535.8,"-- we are using the principles of complicity and solicitation in a statute that is directed at large amounts of criminal activity to inform what these words mean here. I -- I suppose it is possible that someone who does not have any knowledge of how those words are used in the context of facilitation or solicitation statutes might look at it and might have the reaction that they should be given a different meaning, but I don't think that's the standard this Court should apply."
2019.19-67,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3536.32,3537.28,"Thank you, counsel."
