1989.89-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.856,"We'll hear argument now in Number 89-243, Eli Lilly and Company v. Medtronic, Inc.--"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,10.856,25.198,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,139.574,142.125,"Well, the court though so too, didn't it?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,142.125,144.81,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.208,198.695,"Mr. Malloy, am I right the critical language of the statute is,"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,203.849,204.599,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.359,225.596,"No, under... well, but is the last language... I... I just want to make sure I have the last part of the language correct."
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,225.596,226.512,"Oh, absolutely."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.512,229.631,"""Which regulates the manufacture, use or sale of drugs. """
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,229.631,230.5,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.5,230.966,Thank you.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,230.966,251.33,"Now, if... if Medtronic's construction is accepted, what we have then is the inclusion in the exemption by a matter of mere happenstance, a product is now included, even though not referred to, just because it happens to have been regulated under the Federal law, the FD&C Act that also regulates drugs."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.814,290.539,"Well, how do you... how do you answer the argument, though, that the law... the Federal Food and Drug Act, or whatever the... the Federal Drug, Cosmetic and so forth... is a law regulating the sale of drugs?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,290.539,292.757,"Your Honor, it's a law regulating many products."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.757,293.124,Right.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,293.124,294.957,"Drugs are one, devices are another."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,294.957,297.193,But is it not a law regulating the sale of drugs?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,297.193,300.811,"Out of context I think it might be referred to as that, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,300.811,301.18,Well--
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,301.18,305.899,"Within the context of the statute, especially where they have already referred to the entire act--"
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.899,310.368,--Your position is the Federal Food and Drug Act is not a law relating... regulating the sale of drugs?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,310.368,313.32,"--Within the context of this statute, yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.635,367.705,"What it means, in other words, is the provisions of the law regulating drugs, which regulate drugs?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,367.705,368.922,"--I missed the question, but--"
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.922,371.607,You're saying it should be... it's meant to read
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,376.728,381.715,"--Well, I think that's what Medtronic is saying, which happened to regulate drugs or anything else."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.382,385.417,Anything else covered by the statute regulating drugs is their position.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,385.417,386.434,--Yes.
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.785,393.189,And your position is covered by the portions of the statute regulating drugs that do regulate drugs?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,396.391,408.949,"--What I'm saying is it... it... the law that regulates... regulates for development and submission... for example, in drugs, is Section 355 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,425.078,425.761,They did not mean law regulating drugs.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,428.195,431.397,"Well, they didn't mean the entire Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act--"
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.397,431.814,Right.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,431.814,437.885,"--since they've already referred to that just three lines above and had they intended to use that phrase, they would have."
1989.89-243,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,475.26,484.116,Why is it that in answering the Chief Justice's first question you were insistent that the critical words of the statute include
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,488.368,488.818,Yes.
1989.89-243,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,531.763,532.663,You're... you're... excuse me.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,545.938,556.128,"--It... it does if that... it can also refer to an act, Your Honor, if the act does nothing but regulate drugs and if all of its provisions are drug regulatory."
1989.89-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.424,581.78,Is there a question of the Food... Food and Drug Act that requires the development and submission of information only relating to drugs?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,581.78,585.732,"Yes, and that's 355."
1989.89-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.732,590.534,"Then wouldn't the natural way to explain the position, say under Section 355 of the act, if it means what you say?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,590.534,596.104,"Your Honor, they might have done that and... and that's... that's an alternative way they could have done it."
1989.89-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.104,599.54,And that's the meaning you're... you're saying that's what the statute really means?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,599.54,613.632,"Well, I'm not limiting it to 355 because, of course, we have biological products... I mean, human biological products that are regulated under a different section... in fact, a different act, the Public Health Service Act."
1989.89-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.632,615.601,"Well, were they in it when it was first enacted?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,615.601,616.301,They were.
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.44,939.361,"Well, does that apply also to the veterinary biological products?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,939.361,943.081,--Veterinary biological products were added in 1988.
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.081,944.798,"Well, it's there, though."
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,944.798,945.781,"Yes, it is."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,987.944,992.912,"But 271(e)(1) has that... those words in it, does it not?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,992.912,1023.95,"271(e)(1) in 1984 specifically excluded animal drugs and veterinary biological products from its application and then in 1988 both of those things, except when they were manufactured through a genetic engineering process, were both put into the exemption so now animal drugs, veterinary biological products and human drugs, all drug products, I suggest, all of those things are in the exemption of Section (e)(1), yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.95,1026.152,And for the same reason?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1026.152,1037.191,"I can't be certain whether the '88 amendments were for the same... were across the board for the same reasons or not because, as I say, I think there is a speedy provision for animal drugs for--"
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.191,1040.662,"Well, what was the... what was the claimed infringement here?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1040.662,1044.297,--Here it was a medical device called an automatic implantable defibrillator.
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.297,1046.196,"Yes, but what were they using it for?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1046.196,1057.171,"They were using it... they were implanting it in patients on a long-term, permanent basis, selling it for from $17,000 to $20,000 per unit and using it for its normal intended purpose to--"
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.171,1076.685,"Well, I thought that if it's... if it's... if it was used solely... in order to... not to be an infringement, it would have to be used solely for uses reasonably related to the development of information that had to be filed?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1076.685,1086.208,"--That's correct, Justice White, and we would suggest that they aren't in the statute in any event because their uses were so far beyond the solely for clause."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.208,1100.033,"Well, that may be... that may be so, but... but you... you... the argument you're making that even if it was for the purpose stated in this exemption section, that would still be an infringement?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1100.033,1101.567,Let me see if I understand the question.
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.537,1106.987,Right.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1106.987,1122.297,"They are a medical device, and so they're not... no matter how narrowly they conform to the FDA solely for... if they're doing nothing but testing for FDA purposes, they're not within that exemption because they are a medical device rather than a drug."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.297,1123.066,I understand... I understand that.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1136.14,1140.694,I... I'm not... I'm pausing because I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question.
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.283,1176.633,Yes.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1176.633,1183.521,"--that says any manufacture, use or sale by whoever of a patented invention constitutes an infringement."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.606,1189.758,May I ask you one question Justice White's question prompted.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1195.079,1196.312,"They are not, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.118,1203.501,I see.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1203.501,1210.839,"And I think that's a further support that when Congress wants to talk about... if they want to include an entire act, they refer to it."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.425,1217.86,They don't in this... in this statute.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1226.081,1228.316,"--That's... yes, because that's the only thing it regulates."
1989.89-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.316,1229.335,Yeah.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1245.595,1246.528,"Yes, it did."
1989.89-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.758,1274.697,"--Well, but... but... but... but then it went on the way it is now, solely for use as reasonable related to the development under the Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use or sale of drugs did it say?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1274.697,1275.464,--Correct.
1989.89-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.464,1275.964,Of drugs.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1282.101,1283.937,"By ""they"" you mean the veterinary?"
1989.89-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.093,1293.593,And also--
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1293.593,1297.312,And also veterinary biological products.
1989.89-243,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.312,1297.929,--Okay.
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1297.929,1308.418,"There was an Eighth Circuit en banc decision which actually met that point and decided... on Grand Laboratories, I believe... that veterinary biologics were a drug within the meaning of that statute."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.095,1415.557,"Well, you're... you're... you're saying what this exemption doesn't... doesn't cover, but give me an example of something that is... give me an example of the use of a patented invention that is exempt under this section."
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1415.557,1416.074,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.545,1428.128,"What patent, a drug patent?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1428.128,1429.261,--a drug patent.
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.147,1465.836,"So, you say the patented invention that... that won't be infringed under this section is a patent on a drug, is that all?"
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1465.836,1466.32,"Correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.32,1467.07,Is that all?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1467.07,1469.57,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.022,1485.865,And it isn't... and it isn't... it isn't that... that the information that you have to furnish is... must be for the development of a drug?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1485.865,1500.874,"--Well, if... if you... what you were doing was not in order to... solely for the purposes of developing and submitting the information for the FDA, then even your testing would be... would not be... even your drug testing would not be exempt under (e)(1)."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.411,1509.83,The development and submission of information about what?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1509.83,1514.301,"--Under a Federal law that regulates manufacture, use or sale of drugs."
1989.89-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.867,1522.288,It would have to be... your information would have to be relevant to the development of a drug?
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1522.288,1524.323,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1525.573,1529.81,"Well, I thought by your hypothesis you weren't... they weren't developing any new drug."
1989.89-243,0,43019,timothy_j_malloy,,1536.064,1558.996,"--Your Honor, this statute you want applies to both... it says development and submission of information, and if I... if I misspoke when Your Honor asked me the prior question... I may have misspoken... what... what I meant was development and submission of information, and the bioequivalency person must... must' do that, must develop... both develop and submit information."
1989.89-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.65,1723.185,"Thank you, Mr. Malloy."
1989.89-243,1,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1730.423,1736.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court:"
1989.89-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.752,1840.06,"Is that an expansive term in... in... in your belief, a Federal law that regulates drugs so that if a future law is enacted that regulates drugs, it would also fall within this?"
1989.89-243,1,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1840.06,1841.262,"Absolutely, Justice."
1989.89-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.262,1854.237,"So, if Congress made the mistake of having a law that has drugs and also supersonic missiles in the same law, then any patents on supersonic missiles would also come under this exception?"
1989.89-243,1,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1854.237,1859.307,If it met the qualification at the end--
1989.89-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.307,1859.907,Right.
1989.89-243,1,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1859.907,1861.373,--of the section.
1989.89-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.373,1865.561,And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
1989.89-243,1,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1865.561,1891.945,The reason it does make sense is what Congress was trying to legislate here was the intersection between patent law and drug regulation and device regulation and additive regulation.
1989.89-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.33,2052.797,Excuse me.
1989.89-243,1,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2054.831,2056.384,That is Lilly's position.
1989.89-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.733,2117.589,--Was the... was it determined in the case that the use made of this patented invention satisfied the last part of this exemption?
1989.89-243,1,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2117.589,2129.646,That issue is technically still open because the legal question of whether this statute applied to devices has preempted that.
1989.89-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.646,2142.99,"Well, that... you mean if we agreed with you the issue is still open as to whether or not six years of this testing was for the purpose indicated by the exclusion?"
1989.89-243,1,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2142.99,2163.237,"If you decide, as Medtronics contends, that this statute applies to devices, it is still open for the district court to inquire as to whether the particular implants achieved by Medtronic were for the use specified in the statute."
1989.89-243,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.94,2177.677,"Mr. Miller, what about Subsection 2, (e)(2)?"
