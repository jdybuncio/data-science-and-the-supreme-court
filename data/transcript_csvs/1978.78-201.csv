1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.504,The case is submitted we’ll hear arguments next in Greenholtz against Inmates of Nebraska Correctional Institution.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,76.802,80.12,Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,243.994,247.852,One way to comply might be to abolish of parole.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,247.852,248.651,I beg your pardon.
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.651,251.562,One way to comply it might be to abolish the parole system.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,251.562,267.585,"Yeah, it’s very true Your Honor and I think that there, there may well be a strong inclination for various states to do that if some of these procedures are recorded."
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,541.752,550.451,"I suppose that might show that he had done parole three times previously and that all was broken, his conditions with parole that could be --"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,550.451,559.509,They would be purely predictive Your Honor and then the next is even less susceptible to approve.
1978.78-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.273,572.413,Mr. Gillan this case itself didn’t come up to the Supreme Court of Nebraska did it?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,572.413,573.318,I don’t know Your Honor.
1978.78-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.318,576.627,Has the Supreme Court of Nebraska ever interpreted this language?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,576.627,578.905,Never --
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.905,597.611,"The Government as you know, the United States of America is amicus here, construes the Nebraska statutory provisions as being quite different from the mine runners of statutory provisions governing parole in most states."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,601.594,622.214,I am startled at the position that the Solicitor General has taken in this case because I have read the Federal Act and I find it virtually indistinguishable from the Nebraska Act in this respect.
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,649.222,657.343,"Well, do you think the Solicitor General has misconstrued your act or misconstrued the Federal Act?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,657.343,670.117,"Well, I think that he has attempted to make a distinction -- I think that he has misconstrued our act and --"
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.117,675.722,You don’t believe your act confers an entitlement to release in the absence of specific findings?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,675.722,677.357,"No Your Honor, I do not because –"
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,677.357,680.248,So that’s why he does construe it as I understand his brief.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,680.248,710.697,"Yes, the act say, our act says he – it shall order his release and they apparently take the position that they confer some sort of an entitlement, but the distinction that I draw is that it does not order his release conditional upon the finding of any determinable facts or any provable facts that no one is capable --"
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,710.697,714.186,In a set of fact findings these are subjective opinion.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,714.186,715.969,"Exactly, yes."
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,715.969,720.155,"Sometimes hunches, is that not so?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,720.155,734.907,They certainly could be hunches and very often it maybe based on nothing more than the Parole Board’s appraisal of the man as he stands before them.
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.021,759.045,His behavior record there?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,759.045,760.616,Yes.
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.616,765.862,And then also concludes that all people like him are bound to commit crime.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,765.862,773.793,"No, Your Honor, I don’t think that --"
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,773.793,776.561,We’ll judge looking his face.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,776.561,795.886,"Well, certainly it’s not an exact science and I think nobody can within a great confidence look at anyone and reach a conclusion that he will or will not commit further crimes but nevertheless--"
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,795.886,798.041,Where did you get the hunch from?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,798.041,799.845,"Well, I think that --"
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,799.845,803.58,"I think you got it from me, didn’t you?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,803.58,809.096,"Yes, I think the word came from the Chief Justice."
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,833.964,846.369,"When I put the question to you, a proposition to you counsel which is in the sense Judge Hutcheson of the Fifth Circuit used at once in a rather notable article."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,859.381,862.995,Definitely not of course --
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,862.995,871.263,And that’s the distinction you make that when it comes to granting parole they have a vastly wider range of --
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,871.263,898.794,You made it clear in Morrissey versus Brewer that a man who is on parole has an expectation founded on State Law that his parole will not be terminated in the absence of misconduct and so unless they have evidence of specific misconduct they cannot terminate his parole.
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,898.794,928.17,"Mr. Gillan, suppose the State statute provided that the Parole Board could act on the basis of a hunch, say the language was very, very broad and said that because these things are largely discretionary they can act on the basis of their personal experience with respect to certain kinds of people and if they just think that there is some risk that the man may not be behaving properly, they have a statutory right to do it, would that statute be on constitution?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,928.17,933.445,I don’t believe that it would be and I haven’t consider that however –-
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.445,945.746,If its not then there really is no fundamental distinction between granting and denying.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,955.969,970.766,"Well, of course according to the government’s position as I understand it, the statute could provide no standards whatever."
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.449,1016.888,"First of all, will you straighten me on one detail, is an inmate in Nebraska permitted to inspect the file prior to approval of review hearing?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1016.888,1018.762,"No, Your Honor he is not."
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.762,1024.319,"So that if there is something incorrect or adverse in that file, he doesn’t have whack out of them."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1024.319,1028.935,"No, that’s right, he does not."
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.44,1071.15,We submit today a fair determination of facts decisive of rights is the basic purpose of procedure or due process.
1978.78-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.517,1118.884,"Well does that mean really that there are three different positions taken here that the State takes a position there is a neither a liberty or property interest involved, the government says there is a -- the Federal Government says there is a property interest because of the statute and your opponent say there is a liberty interest because of the freedom that would resolve from the granting of parole."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1118.884,1130.579,"I say that there is no liberty interest, because the liberty interest has been taken away from him by his conviction and sense."
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1208.715,1215.863,"Mr. Gillan, doesn’t the Nebraska Statute first provide that after a certain period of time the inmate is eligible for parole."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1215.863,1216.163,Yes sir.
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1216.163,1224.821,Doesn’t it secondly provide that one who has reached that point in time shall be released parole unless there is certain adverse findings made.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1224.821,1225.995,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1225.995,1234.213,And then doesn’t the decision on whether those adverse conditions exist or not determine whether or not he will be in jail?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1234.213,1235.839,"It does Your Honor, but it --"
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.839,1239.493,You say that’s not a liberty interest whether or not he is in jail.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1239.493,1246.536,"Well, it is not dependent upon facts there are no facts."
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1246.536,1252.323,"Well your first -- maybe a liberty interest, but it is not a deprivation of liberty because he is already in jail."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1252.323,1271.788,"That’s correct and there are -- there is nothing, now if we look at a due process hearing as an attempt to discover facts decisive of rights, there are no facts."
1978.78-201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.788,1277.61,"May I interrupt with just another, supposing the statute provided a 10-year term, the man was in jail."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1284.477,1286.395,If the sentence is for 10 years.
1978.78-201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.395,1291.26,"Right, but he is already in jail, has he been deprived of his liberty if he just stays there."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1291.26,1295.873,"Well, he is not in jail then for sure to the sentence."
1978.78-201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.873,1302.028,Now the question is whether the deprivation is a deprivation of liberty when he is kept in jail longer than the law provides.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1302.028,1316.529,"Well, the sentence of 10 years is imposed by the court pursuant to law after the expiration of that 10 years, he is no longer being detained pursuant through the sentence, he is simply being detained by unlawful --"
1978.78-201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.529,1318.442,But is he being deprived from his liberty.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1318.442,1318.96,I beg your pardon.
1978.78-201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.96,1321.455,But is he been deprived with his liberty?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1321.455,1322.14,"Yes, because --"
1978.78-201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.14,1330.095,"Well, then why not if at the end of the parole eligibility period there is a law that says he is entitled to get out unless certain conditions are present."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1339.947,1342.4,In terms of whether there is a deprivation of liberty?
1978.78-201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.816,1373.701,"Well, if this were dependent upon a factual determination then I would say that if the facts that were true that conditionally give him his liberty, then perhaps he would be deprived of a liberty interest."
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1373.701,1384.232,"On Justice Stevens hypothesis, is that a Guarantee of Liberty as the constitution guarantees your liberty and my liberty right now?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1384.232,1387.525,"No it’s certainly, not any guarantee of liberty."
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1387.525,1393.471,"It’s an option for possible release, is it not?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1393.471,1396.238,"Yes, that’s right Your Honor conditioned upon --"
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1396.238,1402.406,"Would you mind reading that statute again it puts an option in them, didn’t that -- would shall in there?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1402.406,1403.33,That’s correct.
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1403.33,1405.128,Is that an option?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1405.128,1407.599,"Well, but it is condition."
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1407.599,1410.011,Does it share your idea with option?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1410.011,1414.895,Unless it can be on its condition.
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1459.754,1467.299,"That’s really not much difference from saying, your point as it drains all the force, the normal force out of the word “shall”."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1467.299,1467.595,Yes.
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1467.595,1473.722,"It says though, it said that Parole Board shall order his release unless it decides that it would be a bad idea."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1473.722,1532.39,"Correct, as I cite in my brief, there are two States, I think as I believe it is Kansas and Iowa, which have substantially identical statutes, not as elaborate as this but in one of them they say “shall” and the other one they say “may” or “shall have the power to” and it would be preposterous I think to say that there is a difference because in the one case it would be saying that the State Parole Board could reach a conclusion that he should be released and that there is no reason why he shouldn’t be released and the statutory criteria had been met and yet because it said that they shall have the power to do so that they could keep him in the penitentiary simply because it didn’t say “shall”."
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1532.39,1547.664,"Don’t you not responsible for Delaware, but is that true that today we’ve had two unique arguments, one is the man can be put in jail on the hunch and the other is that he can be kept there on a hunch."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1547.664,1549.766,"I inferred, no one suggests."
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1549.766,1556.856,Would then State Delaware doesn’t want?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1556.856,1557.676,"Well, certainly."
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.676,1569.337,"Mr. Gillan, you were just reading the statutes supposing there are four reasons why parole release may be denied. One that he may be is, we will not confirm the conditions of parole and then they list the other three."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1589.173,1590.037,"Yes, they do."
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.037,1592.262,Then there is a duty in some circumstances.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1592.262,1603.22,"Well, they certainly have a duty to attempt to obey the law to the best of their ability and I think no one has suggested that that they don’t do it."
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.254,1614.121,They wrote all those things off that probably could be mandamus because the discretionary factor would all be washed wasn’t it?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1614.121,1614.664,Yes.
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.664,1621.625,They would have found all the things necessary to release him therefore have to be a mandamus case.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1621.625,1624.548,"If I’d may, unless there are further questions."
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.548,1634.469,"Yes one further question, if they made those findings would he have a federal constitutional right to be released even though his liberty was then being deprived?"
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1634.469,1650.351,"If they were to make the finding off the record that they were listed, the opinion that these things were true and they may, such a finding then I suspect that they could be mandamus to release him or perhaps have--"
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.351,1655.088,"But, would it be because as the Federal Constitution would then entitle them to their liberty."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1655.088,1687.629,"It would be because the State Statute entitled them to their liberty if the court order make, I mean the Parole Board were to make a finding that they were of the opinion that all of these things had been met, but we nevertheless conclude not to parole him for some undisclosed reasons, which is not authorized by the statute then I think that they would be entitled, he would be entitled to his release under the State’s Statute."
1978.78-201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.629,1697.759,"I understand, but they also have federal right to release."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1697.759,1704.441,"I question that, I haven’t considered it Your Honor, so I would like to give that some thought before I."
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1704.441,1707.671,It does applied in Nebraska.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1707.671,1707.993,I beg your pardon.
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1707.993,1711.814,Federal Constitution does apply to Nebraska.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1718.521,1726.662,"Well, probably we don’t want to put record in writing."
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1726.662,1730.832,The reasons for not granting the parole.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1730.832,1761.419,"Well, the reason we don’t want to put it in writing is that, it would convert the hearing from a determination of these purely subjective matters to an evidentiary hearing and it would probably require the Parole Board to make a record and present evidence which would justify a denial."
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1763.464,1770.21,But the Board admits that and on each case they go through each one of these four points.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1770.21,1771.089,Well.
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1771.089,1773.385,Do you agree is that true?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1773.385,1774.473,They go through yes I assume.
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.473,1777.056,The statute requires them to.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1777.056,1777.94,I’m sure that they.
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.94,1782.087,So why could they just make a note on each one of them.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1782.087,1802.881,"Well, suppose that the reason that they decided that, not to grant this man a parole was that because of the nature of his crime his release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law."
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.757,1852.493,(Inaudible) --
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1852.493,1859.924,That could be given as a reason perhaps but to present evidence I think that it would --
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1859.924,1862.754,That wouldn’t be -- if we had then it would be in the record wouldn’t it?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1862.754,1866.477,"Yeah, that’s the record but how is that evidence --"
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.477,1871.291,The records in this case show the man gouts down the woman’s eyes.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1871.291,1877.844,But is that evidence that his release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect?
1978.78-201,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1877.844,1881.646,"My point is, I have a question what they say."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1884.83,1897.59,"Well, so many times it is purely subjective and it’s simply something that is not susceptible of factual proof."
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1897.59,1903.335,What was this person convicted of?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1903.335,1914.163,He was convicted of robbery Your Honor and was given 50 years and the minimum sentence for robbery is 3 years.
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.614,1922.979,What was he allowable maximum?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1922.979,1933.256,"The allowable maximum was 50, that was the maximum term he was given, and the greatest minimum he could be given would be one-third of 50."
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1941.685,1959.482,"Was he, well so much of this depends upon the original sentence in which theirs is a, never have been thought, would be any requirement of any fact finding or any entitlement on the part of the convicted defendant to short sentence or a medium sentence as contrasted with an allowable longer sentence."
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1959.482,1962.019,That’s correct.
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1970.849,1972.1,One-third of the maximum sentence.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1972.1,1972.265,Yes.
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.265,1974.611,Regardless of what was imposed by the Judge.
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1974.611,1976.622,"Yeah, regardless of what the Judge may want to do."
1978.78-201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.622,1977.941,But what he actually imposed?
1978.78-201,0,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,1977.941,1988.332,"Yes, they’re eligible after serving one-third of the statutory maximum sentence."
1978.78-201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1988.332,1992.168,Mr. Alsup?
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2030.174,2033.161,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1978.78-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2033.161,2037.031,Now that statements are little bit sweetening isn’t that you?
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2041.526,2069.021,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the decisions and the Court sends the Roth case at least in many instances that’s including the Morrissey case have required a statement of reasons as part of the bundle of rights that the Court has prescribed for given circumstance and our reference in the brief an acknowledgment of the fact that on occasion the Court has required a statement of reason."
1978.78-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2069.021,2075.965,"You say in these circumstances, you regard the circumstances the same in Morrissey and here?"
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2075.965,2077.427,"No Your Honor, they’re different circumstances."
1978.78-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2077.427,2078.661,"Quite different, aren’t they?"
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2078.661,2080.851,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.851,2089.342,Do you think Morrissey turned on in the presence of a liberty interest or the presence of the property interest?
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2089.342,2106.512,Morrissey turned upon an entitlement to liberty that was created by the implicit promise as the Chief Justice recognized in the opinion for the Court that that conditional liberty would not be revoked unless certain specified conditions were met.
1978.78-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.512,2123.471,"So you feel that parole provisions of Nebraska here are different than the Morrissey type provisions that you were just describing as refereed from the Chief Justice as it had been, because I take the government’s position is a property interest of the."
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2123.471,2145.351,"Well, the government recognizes that the entitlement of property cases are analogous to the entitlement of liberty cases just in fact that very analogy was used by the Court in Wolff versus McDonnell that there could be a statutorily created right to liberty just as there could be a statutorily created right to property."
1978.78-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.992,2154.987,"Whatever it is, you’re talking about something rooted in the State Law."
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2154.987,2157.344,That’s correct or in a Federal Statute.
1978.78-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.344,2159.951,"Yes, but here in the State Laws."
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2159.951,2160.757,That’s correct.
1978.78-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.757,2170.416,I take it of Supreme Court of Nebraska next month were to say that the Federal Governments constructed its parole statute were wrong and that it’s a purely discretionary thing.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2175.586,2195.095,"If the Supreme Court of Nebraska were to give an authoritative ruling saying that this statute does not mean what it appears to mean, and it’s a purely discretionary parole preceding with no right or entitlement to release upon certain conditions then we would take the position that there would be no due process hearing required."
1978.78-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2201.117,2204.137,You flatter me.
1978.78-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.137,2215.763,"Mr. Alsup, on that point supposing Nebraska adopted a statute that said that the revocation of parole shall be purely discretionary with the Parole Board."
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2227.591,2233.255,Let me respond Mr. Chief Justice Stevens in two respects.
1978.78-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.045,2268.514,Just under the rationale of Morrissey against Brewer just going and staying in the four corners of that opinion the statute I described be constitutional or unconstitutional on your review.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2268.514,2273.311,Again not to fight the hypothetical too much I think this Court.
1978.78-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.311,2275.438,It is listed in your brief in some way.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2275.438,2291.909,"Well, I think we would have to say if in fact it were purely discretionary right to revoke then the particular person out on parole would have no legitimate expectation of continuing with his liberty."
1978.78-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.943,2298.85,And would it follow then that such a statute would be constitutional.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2309.208,2311.518,"Let’s say, if I understand the circumstances."
1978.78-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.093,2335.484,That’s right and the parolee when he’s released gets a copy of the statute and he’s told if we get worried about the way you’re behaving even if we don’t have any proof of anything at all we have the power to revoke your parole like that.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2337.453,2361.84,There might be a problem with such a statute under the division that was apparent in the Court in the Arnett case in which some of the Justices took the position that a substantive right could be prescribed by the state legislature but the procedure for revoking it could not be and I believe six Justices rejected the position that such arbitrary procedures could be huge.
1978.78-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2361.84,2374.897,"I’m familiar with Arnett case, I’m just curious about whether the government has a position on the question which I’ve asked you which you, would you willing identify for us."
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2377.294,2381.68,"Well, that of course is not the case is presented here."
1978.78-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.68,2384.959,"Well, I know but if you just decline to answer you say so."
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2384.959,2385.911,"Well, I would, I’d say subject to the --"
1978.78-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.911,2387.502,I would like to know what it is.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2387.502,2394.096,"Well, we do not have a position and I can only say that there would be Arnett versus Kennedy problem."
1978.78-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2394.096,2415.282,"Well, in the Federal system particularly on many of the States, inmates are released on what’s now called work release very frequently independent of any statute and independent of the parole system they want to go somewhere and work on a job and report back."
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2430.757,2454.087,"In such cases that Mr. Chief Justice I think the government’s position would be clear most of these worked furlough programs are for short durations up to 30 days, and it is in absolute condition of any of those work study or work release programs that the Warden or the Bureau of Prisons has a absolute authority to terminate the program or the liberty at anytime."
1978.78-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2600.566,2603.247,Did you state that Federal?
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2603.247,2603.748,That’s correct.
1978.78-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2603.748,2604.834,Okay.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2604.834,2615.145,This Federal procedure of a presumptive release date has now been extended by regulation issued yesterday to virtually all Federal prisoners.
1978.78-201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2717.663,2724.441,Of the Court of Appeals found that you say that there wasn’t a single Nebraska Judge on the Court of Appeal.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2724.441,2726.482,I’m not sure what States the --
1978.78-201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.482,2727.898,"I’m – no, there wasn’t any."
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2727.898,2743.76,"Well, I can only say that they’re responsible when they take cases from the District Court of Nebraska and in the past, this Court has been willing to defer to a Court of appeals understanding on State Law involved."
1978.78-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2743.76,2755.809,Sometimes the Jury defer a little bit more when there is a Judge of a particular state sitting on the panel although that doesn’t ride us to constitutional dimensions of course.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2755.809,2757.512,"Well, quite right Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-201,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2757.512,2761.244,Sometimes we defer when – it’s even in the different circuit for.
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2766.274,2778.929,"Well, whether or not there should be deference in this case it does appear that the plain language of the statute does provide a presumption of release subject to defeasance for one of any four conditions."
1978.78-201,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2778.929,2783.993,Is that you’re using entitlement as setting [ph] them for properties –-
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2784.805,2787.752,"No, an entitlement either to liberty or to property."
1978.78-201,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2787.752,2793.514,"I see, and you don’t use, here entitlement to what?"
1978.78-201,1,43803,william_alsup,,2793.514,2816.495,"It looks more like liberty than property but because it an entitlement and because both liberty and property are used together in the Due Process Clause, we would think that the analysis which respect to each would be the same whether or not there is some entitlement either to liberty or to property."
1978.78-201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2906.059,2915.355,"Very well, Mr. Alsup, thank you."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,2920.49,2922.892,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.996,2967.172,"What do you think about the question I put first to you on Brandon, if a Judge who has the option to grant probation at the time of the verdict permits a hearing, an argument on whether it should be granted and then simply without any elucidation denies probation and sentences this defendant to traditional term, must you give reasons?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,2967.172,2974.225,"I would start first from the proposition Your Honor, that in sentencing the process if there’s typically not been a requirement for a statement of reasons for the sentencing --"
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2974.225,2976.103,I’m trying to find it out.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3012.616,3023.935,"Yeah of course in the concept -- in the process of the criminal proceeding the inmate or the individual has been accorded a great deal of due process, the facts upon which a judge will base his assertion."
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3023.935,3028.108,"Well, but now that’s all have been terminated with the verdict of the jury."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3028.108,3039.502,"Correct Your Honor, but the judge is acquainted with the facts that came through that process and that’s the facts that will influence his decision as to whether or not to grant probation, as to whether or not what sentence is going to be complied."
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3039.502,3054.361,"But in most states as you’ll find the statute that permits the judge to grant probation, does that create a reasonable expectation that the judge might grant probation?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3054.361,3067.308,It creates a reasonable expectation in my line that the judge might grant probation and to the -- the due process has been accorded throughout the criminal proceeding accords the inmate or the individual what he is entitled to.
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.586,3126.519,"Isn’t that almost exactly the same thing if the judge is required to say why he denies probation, and then denies it, and the prisoner goes to the institution he has got a little bit of a idea of what he should do in order to qualify for a parole, is that not so?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3126.519,3136.102,I have not -- frankly certainly Your Honor the factors or considerations would be precisely same in the probation versus a parole concept.
1978.78-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3249.316,3264.018,"Well, Mr. Ridenour would you suggest that litigants are entitled to be present at our conference following the open sessions of the Court because that’s where we really decide the case even though they had an opportunity to have their counsel argue at an open Court?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3264.018,3266.559,No Your Honor I’m not suggesting that at all.
1978.78-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.116,3286.683,"But he does have an opportunity to appear before the Parole Board, doesn’t he?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3286.683,3288.948,For five minutes at a review hearing.
1978.78-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3288.948,3297.245,"Well, you say that we are prohibited by the constitution from limiting arguments to say 30 minutes?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3297.245,3303.226,I think there is a requirement -- no I don’t think that you are prohibited by the constitution from limiting arguments to 30 minutes.
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3308.516,3313.546,"We decide in our cases without argument than with argument, don’t we?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3313.546,3340.532,"Certainly, but you are not affecting, Your Honor, my interest, you are not affecting me the person appearing before you, statements in the parole context and the risk of the erroneous decisions inherent in the types of records of Parole Board deals with and the type of discretionary decisions they make, that inmate must have or his counsel or someone must have the ability to examine those records and to make corrections and to appear before that Board and make his case."
1978.78-201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.532,3360.961,"Mr. Ridenour what if the Nebraska law simply listed these factors just like they are and said, the decisions shall be entirely within the discretion of the parole officers and not subjected to judicial review, it is completely within the discretion of the parole boards."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3360.961,3368.625,I think the very listing of factors Your Honor regardless of the prefatory language in the statute limits in some effect that discretion.
1978.78-201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3370.783,3379.216,But the statute says that all you have to do is to-- is hear the factors then you apply it.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3394.954,3406.601,But I believe in the contexts that we are dealing with Your Honor hearing in fact will do good because there are objective factors required to be considered by the Nebraska Statutes associate be shall consider -- the Board shall consider the 14 factors.
1978.78-201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3406.601,3415.436,What -- at the most so far what you’re saying is that the inmate should be assured that they went through the procedure?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3415.436,3418.395,That they considered the factors and that the factors were in fact correct.
1978.78-201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3418.395,3421.013,That has very much to do with the hearing.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3421.013,3426.608,It does in the sense it gives the inmate the ability to know whether the factors --
1978.78-201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.608,3430.78,"But what if the statutes said that when they are through, they will certify what they did."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3451.188,3460.727,"Due process requires or the state statutes in the first place Your Honor requires those factors to be considered, many of those factors can come only from the inmate and the only opportunity he would have is either through a written submission--"
1978.78-201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3460.727,3463.95,Or he might have an opportunity to make sure they considered it.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3463.95,3470.809,I would suggest that a written submission Your Honor in the case of many inmates would not be an adequate opportunity for that inmate to make his case.
1978.78-201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.829,3490.9,Do you think you should be able to testify or call witnesses?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3490.9,3494.078,I do Your Honor.
1978.78-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3533.288,3540.716,"-- hearing with a lawyer, I shudder."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3540.716,3546.389,I shudder at the thought too if all hearings were to have lawyers at it and if it was of very adversarial nature.
1978.78-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3558.128,3560.965,He can ask some of the inmates or someone like that.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3560.965,3564.617,We are not contending here that he has a right to an attorney in this type of proceedings.
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3570.966,3574.031,I think you mentioned 645 hearings.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3574.031,3575.935,645.
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.935,3578.893,"Seven minutes, seven minutes was the average."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3578.893,3581.011,That’s my computation.
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3581.011,3589.012,My take at that means that some hearings might have been 30 minutes and some might have been two minutes or --
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3589.012,3595.971,It’s not my understanding Your Honor in review hearings of many there would be a rare exception that any would run 30 minutes.
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3602.461,3606.346,"Well of course in many courts, including this one."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3623.143,3636.394,"No, I think most cases arising in this Court however have come from lower courts where there was in fact a great deal of due process court and that’s significantly different in the parole situation."
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3636.394,3653.406,"And now when you talk about the informal procedure the very purpose, historic purpose of procedure and formality is to speed up the process instead of letting people just wander all over the lot and talk at will in any form they want."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3658.995,3660.291,I think that it first needs to --
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3660.291,3662.071,Have you done a calculation on that?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3662.071,3677.245,"No, I have not done a calculation on that but for each of the formal hearings that we would, in the words of the board they would call it a formal hearing, if they could call it due process right so the due process this Court might say was applicable."
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3684.684,3689.623,Would you guess that would double or triple or add 50% or add --?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3689.623,3697.13,It would approximately double the number of formal hearings that were likely to be held by the Nebraskan Parole Board during the year.
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3711.534,3717.069,Do you think we should tell Nebraska how many of its parole officers should sit in that hearing?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3717.069,3719.586,"No, this Court should not tell Nebraska that."
1978.78-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3810.923,3816.173,"Is that word shall or may, you wouldn’t have any case at all, you concede that?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3816.173,3818.098,I do not concede that at all Your Honor.
1978.78-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3835.09,3838.001,At least in being fully and fairly considered for parole?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3838.001,3844.415,"At least in that respect, whether it be considered the right to parole or the right to be fully considered, it’s the same result."
1978.78-201,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3848.496,3855.249,"You mean their expectations, don't you, because he doesn’t have any liberty now?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3855.249,3856.436,I agree with you in that respect.
1978.78-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3873.462,3881.577,"Mr. Ridenour could I ask you a question about the stipulation of facts that appears in page 30, and 31 of the appendix?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3881.577,3883.294,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1978.78-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3883.294,3895.305,Paragraph one says discretionary parole is used by the Nebraska Board of Parole as the release on parole by virtue of an exercise of discretion on the part of Board of Parole.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3899.675,3903.438,"No, we are talking about discretionary parole."
1978.78-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3919.207,3926.827,But you say in the stipulation that there is a release on parole by virtue of an exercise of discretion on the Board of Parole?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,3926.827,3937.655,"I do not deny that there are large elements of discretion in the parole release proceeding, but I suggest that Nebraska statutes channel and instruct the Parole Board on how to exercise that discretion."
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3999.871,4026.906,"What if, what if the record showed that a particular inmate coming up for eligibility and his record is being processed in the board and by the staff and it shows that seven times in four years he was put in solitary confinement for assaulting fellow prisoners and guards, and the most recent being within 30 days."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4034.735,4036.758,"You are asking me, do I think he has been denied due process?"
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4052.143,4066.798,"That’s what we are suggesting. Morrissey is the only reason for holding it, but suppose there is only one John McCormick Doe in the entire prison, and the Chairman says, check this out and they say, yes there is only one."
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4066.798,4077.844,"I certainly agree with you Your Honor that in some extreme circumstances we are going to know, and the Parole Board is going to know, beforehand that a hearing-- and perhaps the inmate will know, is essentially useless."
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4310.545,4312.042,Mr. Ridenour.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4312.042,4312.566,Yes Your Honor.
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4312.566,4324.319,"Could you tell us a little bit about the Board in Nebraska, how large is it, how is it selected, for what terms do they serve, how they are compensated and what staff do they have?"
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4324.319,4328.043,"I can answer some of those questions, I am not sure I can answer all of them for you Your Honor."
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4341.679,4343.275,Do they serve the specified terms?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4343.275,4344.595,I believe they do.
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4344.595,4348.806,And what sort of staff do they have?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4348.806,4352.539,I think I am going to have to defer to Mr. Gillan because he works with them on a daily basis and I --
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4352.539,4353.572,They do have a staff.
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4353.572,4358.555,"They do have a staff, I do not know how large that staff is, they do much of their own work."
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4366.011,4369.372,Are the two permanent members the board --
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4369.372,4370.307,Three permanent members Your Honor.
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4370.307,4375.994,Three permanent subject to the jurisdiction of the same individual in-charge of the penal system or they’re independent?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4375.994,4378.21,"No they are not, they are separate."
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4378.21,4379.192,They are independent.
1978.78-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4379.192,4380.187,Are they compensated?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4380.187,4380.844,They are compensated.
1978.78-201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4380.844,4381.571,All five of them?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4381.571,4383.389,"All five of them, they are compensated."
1978.78-201,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4383.389,4386.404,And they meet only twice a month?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4386.404,4388.857,"No, they meet more frequently than that."
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4409.288,4417.101,But you are not suggesting that the part-time people put in only two days a month in the aggregate?
1978.78-201,2,17962,brian_k_ridenour,,4417.101,4418.145,No I am not Your Honor.
1978.78-201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4504.179,4508.387,"All right well, do you have something further in counsel?"
1978.78-201,3,39327,ralph_h_gillan,,4508.387,4524.923,"We’ve, not Your Honor except that I will say that the Attorney General’s office does not work with the Parole Board on a daily basis, and so we are not as intimately familiar with their procedures as Mr. Ridenour would indicate."
1978.78-201,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4550.657,4551.144,Thank you gentlemen.
