1955.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.7,"Number 20 on the docket, Corn Products Refining Company versus Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,17.997,19.786,May it please the Court.
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,25.095,25.139,Yes.
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,25.139,50.783,-- of this case to illustrate certain points.
1955.20,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,476.565,483.247,Here were your words when you said that lawfully storage capacity which I think it is the yellow line.
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,483.247,483.776,That is correct.
1955.20,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,483.776,485.372,What -- what's the next --
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,485.372,492.541,That is the inventory on hand of finished goods and above that the futures position.
1955.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,673.455,683.373,"When you say that he -- when you say that he was not hedging, that means he had some other reason in his -- in the course of his business to do or to do what he was doing other than just to protect the price?"
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,683.373,692.827,"In effect, the decision was -- was that they were speculating in excess of a two million bushel position, which was allowable under the rules of -- of the department."
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,692.827,695.432,"Meaning by that, meaning in future there is such."
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,695.432,697.295,Right.
1955.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,699.788,711.393,"Well, what is your position, Mr. Kramer, to the petitioner in this case as to whether that was hedged or not in the -- in the case that's on appeal?"
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,711.393,722.726,The petitioner in that case points to a different definition of hedging contained in the Commodity Exchange Act which says a reasonable hedge.
1955.20,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,759.925,767.818,What -- what was the amount of bushels that -- the highest purchase a bushel?
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,767.818,772.122,"About 11 million, almost 11 million bushels."
1955.20,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,772.122,774.024,And your annual consumption?
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,774.024,789.207,Our annual consumption ran from 35 million bushels in 1936 or 1937 to over 60 million bushels in 1942.
1955.20,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1240.027,1244.401,Was your reply brief -- was it filed --
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1244.401,1250.298,"I'm very sorry, Your Honor, I thought that our reply brief was available to the Court."
1955.20,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1250.298,1253.661,I -- I have a reply brief filed January 5th.
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1253.661,1258.352,I think that's on the certiorari application.
1955.20,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1258.352,1262.667,Where is this?
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1262.667,1264.331,"Sorry, sir."
1955.20,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1352.389,1358.707,Were they still being used in some way in lieu of storage in the way you spoke of in the first instance?
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1358.707,1365.31,I -- I understand that petitioner still maintains a position in corn futures.
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1522.614,1528.385,What is the history or what you called the designated exception?
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1528.385,1531.066,"I will come to that at once, sir."
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1531.066,1532.72,Just take your time.
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1532.72,1545.686,"In 1934, Congress abolished the two-year rule defining capital assets and thereafter said all assets are capital assets."
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1676.033,1679.761,Based in the words that they rest on the General Counsel's Memorandum?
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1680.513,1680.882,Many of them --
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1680.882,1682.203,-- administrative factors?
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1682.203,1683.699,Many of them did so.
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1852.02,1856.525,Did the Tax Court elucidate what it meant by method of authority (Inaudible)
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1856.525,1872.463,"Unfortunately, the Tax Court's opinion in this case which appears in the record at page 203 -- I'm sorry, 201 and following, is very cryptic."
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1920.255,1927.789,"Do you agree with the next thing especially considering this was largely in effect of (Inaudible), do you agree with that?"
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1927.789,1934.227,I don't think the courts have treated this as a factual situation at any point.
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1947.101,1954.59,I suppose younger lawyers in the courts (Inaudible)
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1954.59,1958.631,"Well, the phrase hedging has many connotations including hedging on --"
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1958.631,1964.268,To determine whether it is or it isn't (Inaudible) hedges --
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1964.268,1965.075,I --
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1965.075,1967.529,-- has made a question of loss.
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1967.529,1969.98,"Well, the cases so treat it."
1955.20,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1981.804,1986.295,Unless there must be a (Inaudible)
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,1986.295,1989.909,I am going to endeavor to do so.
1955.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2171.287,2190.072,"Well, what that does mean, that phrase, because if you were ( or engaged in cottons, especially it's a profitable (Inaudible) would that be a capital asset in relation to (Inaudible) as hedging?"
1955.20,0,31300,jay_o_kramer,,2190.072,2195.32,"In the same Supreme Court case, it defined hedging that Christie Grain case."
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,2472.509,2477.888,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of the Court."
1955.20,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2976.745,2986.732,"Either these sales of repurchasing the (Inaudible), were they all sell -- selling at one month and they're buying at the -- of a different future?"
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,2986.732,2987.818,"Yes, sir, in general."
1955.20,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3023.252,3025.367,(Voice Overlap) -- because in Section 118 --
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,3025.367,3025.894,"Yes, sir."
1955.20,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3025.894,3026.633,-- as I understand.
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,3026.633,3027.383,"Yes, sir."
1955.20,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3027.383,3041.762,And whether that -- that's when there's a motor sale and of course to adopt the General Motor stock -- suppose General Motor stock in December and bought in January and you have precisely the same thing.
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,3041.762,3043.129,"That's what we contend, Your Honor."
1955.20,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3043.129,3055.756,"Now, if you sold September corn and there is the September corn and bought in December, is that your point and then you're buying different things?"
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,3055.756,3060.262,That you're buying substantially identical appliance.
1955.20,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3061.815,3064.113,Even though the delivery date is different.
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,3064.113,3066.702,Even though the -- the delivery date is different.
1955.20,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3066.702,3075.506,"When you -- when you sell, what month?And within 30 days, buy back a different product or the same product, then your -- your (Voice Overlap) --"
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,3075.506,3078.793,Our contention is that that's substantially identical property.
1955.20,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3089.088,3090.527,A different (Inaudible)
1955.20,1,41797,samuel_a_mccain,,3090.527,3096.333,The only difference between the September and the December is -- is the -- is the storage.
1955.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3276.123,3283.877,Mr. Rice.
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,3283.877,3285.845,If the Court please.
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3582.451,3587.777,How does that general principle help us to determine what is and what is not (Inaudible)
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,3587.777,3589.345,"Well, that's -- that's --"
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3589.345,3593.192,Suggesting to you that the ordinary -- the case itself --
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,3593.192,3593.527,It's a suggestion --
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3593.527,3595.314,-- hold -- hold against it.
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,3595.314,3626.927,"It's -- it's a suggestion, Your Honor, that -- that Congress thought of capital gains and losses in the manner in which we contend the statute could be construed as relating primarily to investment properties and not something which is an integral part of the manufacturing process, the integral part of operating profit recurring from day-to-day and from year-to-year."
1955.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4217.507,4229.763,Doesn't make any difference if these purchasers of futures were brokers and they are not (Inaudible)
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4229.763,4235.46,"Well, no, I don't think it makes any difference to the theory of our case, Your Honor."
1955.20,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4464.447,4468.602,What kind of evidence did you find?
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4468.602,4473.246,"The evidence is largely factual, Your Honor."
1955.20,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4474.51,4485.208,(Inaudible)
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4485.208,4501.989,"Well, the issue is whether or not the particular person or company is protecting itself against fluctuations in the market, against the rise and fall of prices."
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4501.989,4508.641,They would buy futures of another commodity in order to offset against the losses for that time?
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4508.641,4509.911,"No -- no, Your Honor, that's not --"
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4509.911,4513.278,Although the -- although the (Inaudible)
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4513.278,4515.419,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.20,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4515.419,4526.105,"Well, but here they were buying the kind of (Inaudible)"
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4526.105,4538.989,"Well, the basis of proof is whether or not they were guarding themselves against rises in the -- in this case and rises against in the prices of corn."
1955.20,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4538.989,4539.993,And that's decided.
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4543.419,4552.894,"Well, it would be offered by the testimony of -- of the company's officials as to why the -- pardon?"
1955.20,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4552.894,4554.078,As to their purpose?
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4554.078,4555.841,As to why they purchased it.
1955.20,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4555.841,4556.616,As to their purpose?
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4556.616,4576.954,As to why they purchased it and by relevant statistics as to fluctuations in the price which occurred then and which had -- had them occurring previously and technical testimony of that nature.
1955.20,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4576.954,4580.208,Is it a question of determining what their motive was or --
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4580.208,4581.077,"Well, it's a question --"
1955.20,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4581.077,4582.053,-- (Inaudible)
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4582.053,4598.014,It's a question primarily a fact as to whether or not they were guarding themselves against price changes that would be adverse to them.
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4598.014,4619.657,"Mr. Rice, is there any -- any established, factual, or any deciding consideration in the Treasury as to grain, the pronouncements of General Counsel's incorporated in the regulations and under that (Inaudible) General Counsel's own ways?"
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4619.657,4644.2,"Well -- and we rely on the decisions holding that whether there's been a settled administrative practice, the -- the courts will accept that practice where Congress has reenacted the law numerous times in the phase of that settled administrative practice."
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4658.431,4677.296,"I was wondering whether it's chance or is there some -- some established reason for purchasing, when they do and when they don't (Inaudible) the counsel's legal opinion into (Inaudible) --"
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4677.296,4679.407,"Well, I don't think, Your Honor, that an answer --"
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4679.407,4680.896,Is there a chance of --
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4680.896,4696.672,I don't think an answer could be given which would cover all of the reasons or all of the situations in which questions become part of the Treasury regulations and -- and those which haven't.
1955.20,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4696.672,4700.187,"Suppose that they could resist, the Government did not assign (Inaudible) prosecution."
1955.20,2,19936,charles_k_rice,,4700.187,4706.367,I think that's probably it.
1955.20,3,31300,jay_o_kramer,,6543.801,6549.981,"I believe I have six minutes to reply, the marshal has so informed me."
1955.20,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6738.231,6740.427,What do you take the position for?
1955.20,3,31300,jay_o_kramer,,6744.71,6747.819,We are entitled to take a position.
