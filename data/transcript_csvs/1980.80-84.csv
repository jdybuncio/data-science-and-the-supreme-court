1980.80-84,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1803.26,1810.532,"Mr. Alop, forgive me, before you start, but where is it... that the requirement that it appear on the face... where is that in the statute?"
1980.80-84,1,15428,alan_a_alop,,1810.532,1815.834,"--That's in Regulation Z, Your Honor, at 12 C.F.R. Section 226.8(a)."
1980.80-84,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1815.834,1822.839,Now heres's Regulation Z at page 2 of the petition... what's the language in Regulation Z that says the front?
1980.80-84,1,15428,alan_a_alop,,1822.839,1838.699,The language in 226.8(a)(1) is that all of the disclosures shall be made together on either the note or other instrument evidencing the obligation on the same side of the page and above or adjacent to the place for the customer's signature.
1980.80-84,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1844.603,1846.003,What are you reading from?

1980.80-84,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1855.375,1856.292,Isn't that the crux of this case?
1980.80-84,1,15428,alan_a_alop,,1858.194,1859.945,--The other side has not disputed this.
1980.80-84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.814,1867.866,"Yes, but it wouldn't... it would only be because of the regulation?"
1980.80-84,1,15428,alan_a_alop,,1867.866,1869.634,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.967,1876.554,"If there weren't any provision like that, no Court has construed the statute to require that."
1980.80-84,1,15428,alan_a_alop,,1876.554,1877.82,--That's correct.
1980.80-84,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1930.739,1952.368,"Well now, the Proposed Official Staff Interpretation 173, which as I understand it has not yet become effective, does say that this kind of interest need not be... need not appear on the face of the statement."
