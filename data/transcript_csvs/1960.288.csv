1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,13.69,15.717,May it please the Court.
1960.288,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,201.272,204.186,Could I suggest one point at this point that I --
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,204.186,204.278,"Yes, sir."
1960.288,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,204.278,205.98,-- hope you'll cover in your argument.
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,225.767,226.028,"Yes, sir."
1960.288,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,227.786,236.638,"Does the Commissioner take the position that under no circumstances, these can be -- be adjusted through the year?"
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,236.638,237.316,He does.
1960.288,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,239.497,240.639,Under any circumstances --
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,240.639,249.939,The Commissioner volunteers the definition of accrual accounting which says never later than the year of receipt.
1960.288,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,253.114,266.815,I'd like to know if I might (Inaudible) as to how does this in dollars and cents affect the Government over a course of the long run?
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,266.815,267.835,Inso -- in --
1960.288,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,267.835,269.711,Does affect the dollars and cents (Voice Overlap) --
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,269.711,272.843,It should not over the long run.
1960.288,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,289.466,294.676,"What if -- even if your theory were adopted, it wouldn't lose dollars over the long (Inaudible)."
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,294.676,297.807,"No, it would not."
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,297.807,300.557,"They would lose -- they would lose in the year the gears were shifted, wouldn't it?"
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,303.437,304.471,There is no transition --
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.471,305.578,"In this case, there is not."
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,305.578,307.101,No.
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,315.275,315.347,Yes.
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,315.347,321.534,But a change can be made only with the approval of the Commissioner and under such conditions as he specifies.
1960.288,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,321.534,323.662,May I ask just one more question?
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,342.452,353.134,"Only if income is clearly reflected and if necessary in order to match prepaid income with related cause, then it should be permitted."
1960.288,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,353.134,353.451,"Very well, now --"
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,353.451,354.817,But not every circumstance.
1960.288,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,354.817,356.031,"Well, now, is that accounting?"
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,359.187,360.39,"There is sound accounting principles, yes."
1960.288,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,360.39,370.516,"Well, I say and -- and if it is sound accounting, do you claim there is no limitation upon your right to do what you seek to do in this case?"
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,370.516,374.305,If income is clearly reflected.
1960.288,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,374.305,378.079,In the accountings.
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,378.079,383.051,"If you compute income accurately, yes, sir, to determine what is net income."
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.28,1115.091,"There's -- there's now a statue -- there's now a statute specifically covering subscriptions, isn't there?"
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1115.091,1117.04,There is now.
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1119.457,1119.829,I understand.
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1119.829,1125.871,-- the Beacon case.
1960.288,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1205.201,1206.98,I don't quite understand it.
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1211.031,1211.205,452 and 462 (Voice Overlap) of the statute.
1960.288,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1211.205,1220.259,-- but here is -- here is what bothers me.I was in dissent in Michigan as you know and I don't recall this argument being made.
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1265.97,1266.796,The legislative history --
1960.288,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1266.796,1267.848,-- you can say it but --
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1267.848,1287.629,"The Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee both stated that it was to have no bearing whatsoever on the law as it existed prior to the enactment in repeal and even expressly referred to Beacon Publishing Company and said, “Where clearly not -- nothing in repeal of this legislation shall have any adverse effect on that case.”"
1960.288,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1288.803,1292.621,You answer this -- do you answer the Government's argument in your reply brief?
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1292.621,1294.14,"Yes, sir."
1960.288,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1294.14,1296.539,"Now, I haven't heard that yet, maybe that's --"
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1296.539,1307.404,Isn't -- isn't it true that one of the things that 452 or -- and/or 462 did was to allow taxpayers to shift their method of accounting without permission of the Commissioner.
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1307.404,1308.05,It did.
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.271,1308.729,And it --
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1308.729,1309.662,And that's where the loss came out.
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1309.662,1311.25,And that's where the rub came and that --
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1311.25,1311.259,Yes.
1960.288,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.259,1314.028,-- that's where the transitional loss came in.
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1314.028,1334.56,"Furthermore, those statutes, Section 452 and 462 were drafted in very general terminology that that is -- did not identify the type of prepaid income that they were talking about and a lots of claims were being made by taxpayers because of the generality of the statutes which would not be authorized under sound accounting principles."
1960.288,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1334.586,1337.63,"There was no reference to those statutes in Michigan, was it?"
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1337.63,1338.231,I beg your pardon?
1960.288,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1338.231,1341.516,"No reference made in those statutes in Michigan, was it?"
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1341.516,1341.915,Yes.
1960.288,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1345.007,1345.522,It was --
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1345.522,1345.556,Yes.
1960.288,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1345.556,1346.468,-- on 452?
1960.288,0,23582,fleming_bomar,,1346.468,1351.773,On 452 and 462 and appears in both briefs there.
1960.288,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1396.798,1397.309,Mr. Oberdorfer.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1397.309,1400.893,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1829.781,1833.198,"Well, can you give us an example of what you have in mind?"
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1833.198,1834.736,Yes.
1960.288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1889.042,1891.121,"That's just, in other words, ordinary accrual accounting."
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1891.121,1892.411,"Accrual Accounting, of course."
1960.288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1892.411,1913.164,"But how about the -- is it your position that -- as indicated on page 20 of your brief that, “An accrual-basis taxpayer has to report an item as gross income no later than the year of actual payment.”"
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1913.164,1918.839,"Well, first of all, that's not true in every case because there are some statutory exceptions."
1960.288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1918.839,1920.318,"Well, one of it is of course the magazine subscriptions."
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1920.318,1921.719,"That's correct, sir."
1960.288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2009.58,2012.852,"Well, it has -- Section 22 doesn't say any by plaintiffs."
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2012.852,2013.209,"No, sir."
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2239.497,2239.92,What -- what was --
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2239.92,2241.108,"And therefore, he used his method."
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2241.108,2248.09,What were the findings of the Court of Claims as to whether it did or it did not properly reflect income?
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2248.09,2253.168,The -- the Court of Claims found that it did clearly reflect income in the --
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2253.168,2256.78,"You didn't introduce me the evidence, did you? The Government didn't."
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2256.78,2258.394,"No, sir."
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2258.394,2260.764,Are you arguing now that we should overturn those findings?
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2260.764,2261.129,"No, sir."
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2276.839,2277.153,Yes.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2285.785,2286.907,Yes.
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2286.907,2290.388,-- this does properly reflect income.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2300.121,2300.691,"That's correct, sir."
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2300.691,2301.272,Is that it?
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2301.272,2302.066,That's correct.
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2302.066,2305.303,That depends a good deal on the validity of your argument on --
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2305.303,2305.622,On the --
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2305.622,2307.461,-- 452 and -- and --
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2307.461,2312.7,"It does, although we can make this argument within the four corners where the code as it did now exist."
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2313.073,2314.495,A little more difficult without the exception.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2314.495,2315.644,"It -- yes, the other is --"
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2315.644,2317.188,(Voice Overlap)
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2317.188,2322.91,The -- the specific statement of the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee.
1960.288,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2570.967,2571.879,Mr. Oberdorfer.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2571.879,2573.248,"Yes, sir."
1960.288,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2573.248,2585.846,What would be the difference between the system you insist should be followed and the through cash basis?
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2585.846,2610.475,"The -- the difference is that under the cash basis, this taxpayer would be taxable on the dues he received in advance but he could only deduct in the year in which he received the dues, the amounts that he'd actually spent out of -- out of pocket for all those expenses."
1960.288,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2610.475,2615.249,And that -- isn't that what you say you ought to do?
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2615.249,2616.587,"No, sir."
1960.288,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2627.782,2629.847,"Now, how would he accrue them, would you explain that to me?"
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2631.201,2643.694,"I -- I don't -- I -- I don't want to tell the three A's how they could change their business so they could accrue a deduction for -- for their obligation to their members, it maybe that they could do it."
1960.288,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2697.17,2704.325,"Now, why on the same basis can it not deduct its towing cost as one example?"
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2704.325,2711.832,We say that -- first would -- one reason in this case is that they haven't -- they -- they haven't -- they haven't set the books of that one.
1960.288,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2756.686,2760.404,Even there forecast on an actuarial basis as it were?
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2760.404,2761.201,It's conceivable.
1960.288,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2761.201,2761.71,"Yes, it isn't what the basis --"
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2761.71,2775.764,It's conceivable -- it's conceivable that if this could be calculated with the precision that insurance companies calculate their liabilities on a scientific actuarial basis that there could be an accrual at that point.
1960.288,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2776.037,2780.413,"You mean if this could be done, as -- as to whom (Inaudible) or a member."
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2780.413,2781.366,Or it could be done -- it could be --
1960.288,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2781.366,2783.062,How come they're becoming mess?
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2783.062,2791.9,There -- but there are -- there are -- there are tests about what is an actuarial as distinguished from an accounting estimate of the future.
1960.288,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2801.321,2804.965,This Court has divided on that proposition as you know.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2804.965,2805.887,I -- I -- I'm not --
1960.288,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2805.887,2808.99,It -- it could be allowed as to what a widow makes then.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2808.99,2813.105,This is a -- this is a serious problem.
1960.288,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2864.486,2876.567,"Mr. Oberdorfer, is there anything involved, dollars and cents-wise aside from the point you made, namely a possible delay in receiving -- receiving part of the money?"
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2878.67,2879.54,Dollars and cents?
1960.288,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2879.54,2881.561,Yes.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2881.561,2890.492,That's -- that's a lot when -- when you're -- when you're the United States but that is all that's involved.
1960.288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2959.935,2975.417,"Well, but Mr. Oberdorfer, we're talking about an accrual-basis taxpayer and I would doubt very much that many people go to a barber shop and say, “Now, let me pay you $50 and you take care of all my haircut and shaving needs for 1961."""
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2975.417,2979.364,I have a book of coupons from a taxi company which --

1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3077.779,3082.451,What scope do you give to Section 41 -- what scope to do you give to Section 41 under your view?
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3082.451,3094.545,Section 41 means to us that the method of accounting can be used provided it pays proper respect to the annual accounting period.
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3179.926,3188.016,Do you agree with what -- I've -- I'm now going to pursue this reply brief on this 452.
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3205.673,3209.2,I -- I was -- I was troubled by that when I saw it as the reply brief.
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3224.602,3225.639,"Well, what --"
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3225.639,3227.681,That is what the House and -- House Committee exactly --
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3227.681,3235.326,"Well, you can merely leave that out of account on what you're driven back to is your position that under the cases in this Court --"
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3235.326,3236.208,And --
1960.288,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3236.208,3246.454,"-- your position is sustained or if not sustained, why -- and this is a new problem why we ought to -- to construe the statutes the way you talk -- you argue."
1960.288,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3246.481,3250.863,"That is our position, Mr. Justice."
1960.288,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3250.863,3255.202,Mr. Bomar.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3255.202,3257.083,May it please the Court.
1960.288,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3413.554,3419.497,How precise is the -- is the prediction of the costs of these memberships?
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3419.497,3420.874,Quite accurate.
1960.288,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3421.621,3422.922,It would seem (Voice Overlap) with this.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3427.949,3428.043,Pretty close.
1960.288,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3428.043,3428.874,I assume that's correct.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3428.874,3438.134,"In the years involved, the cost of serving one member for a 12-month period was something like $14.50 one year and $14.61 the next."
1960.288,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3451.952,3460.029,What would you say about to Mr. Oberdorfer's illustration in his taxicab book?
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3460.029,3472.474,"Generally speaking, if the principles of accrual accounting aren't followed, the -- Mr. Oberdorfer is paying for 10 taxicabs rides in advance of performance."
1960.288,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3488.41,3490.343,That -- assuming the taxicab driver wanted to be on accrual basis.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3490.343,3492.249,Was an accrual-basis taxpayer.
1960.288,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3492.249,3492.733,Yes.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3492.733,3501.433,"Otherwise, you're taxing an advance as “net income” when it's not income at all, it's simply an advance like a loan from a bank."
1960.288,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3588.252,3590.673,Do you have the circumstances of that kind?
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3596.638,3596.644,In every case.
1960.288,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3596.644,3598.916,"Well, you run the service first."
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3598.916,3601.512,In every case since the member prepays --
1960.288,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3601.512,3602.079,"No, (Voice Overlap)"
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3602.079,3603.089,-- for a 12 --
1960.288,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3603.089,3609.092,Are there any instances wherein you run in the service in a particular year and do not get the money until the year subsequent.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3609.092,3611.221,"No, sir."
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3618.625,3626.136,"Mr. Bomar, one of the questions asked by Mr. Justice Whittaker, the Government counsel told me to ask this one."
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3644.362,3649.635,There should be no loss of revenue to the Government in the long run if --
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3649.635,3652.699,Any gain -- any gain to the association in the long run?
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3652.699,3679.984,"There's no gain to the -- there's a tremendous gain to the association in the sense that we only have to pay net income -- income taxes on what's net income and we don't have -- I mean, take the case of the December member again, if you've got to pay an income tax on $11 out of $12 of advance dues, you don't have money enough leftover after 52% tax with which to pay the cost in the following year of serving the member, so it makes a tremendous difference to it."
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3680.818,3682.626,I don't quite understand it yet.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3687.286,3687.941,Yes.
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3687.941,3691.809,And on your accrual basis as it's (Inaudible) quite difference to you.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3695.66,3697.106,It makes this difference.
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3708.737,3709.213,Suppose (Voice Overlap) --
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3709.213,3720.419,"Then you level out -- then when you level out, it makes no difference to you which you never pick up what you have prepaid to the Government on something that's not income and it never evens out --"
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3720.419,3727.503,"Suppose the clubs knew because I'm sure yours is not but suppose if instead growing fast, it's losing the members."
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3727.503,3741.813,"When in the years when the membership declines, you finally are correcting the inequity to the extent of the decline and the inequity is not finally washed out until the last member leaves the club."
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3741.813,3743.563,I heard a lot of talk about the profits here.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3748.75,3761.042,"Well, we are -- we tempt to break even obviously but sometimes it -- when you don't know how you're going to have to pay your income taxes for example, you may have charged enough to -- [Laughter]"
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3761.042,3768.597,"Well, the part -- the part -- the part was interested to me was you said the members didn't get it."
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3768.597,3768.849,It is a membership.
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3768.849,3770.688,And I don't understand that.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3770.688,3772.142,It is a membership association.
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3772.142,3772.903,Yes.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3772.903,3775.966,And the members would get the benefit of it.
1960.288,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3783.165,3784.851,Do they get refunds?
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3784.851,3793.26,"Yes, they get refunds in all proper cases asides when member dies or he moves to another city, a refund is made."
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3814.541,3818.668,I don't suppose that profit is enough to disqualify judge.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3818.668,3819.504,I beg your pardon?
1960.288,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3819.504,3824.928,I don't suppose that profit if prospective profit is enough to disqualify judges.
1960.288,2,23582,fleming_bomar,,3826.247,3827.365,I would hope not sir.
