1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.81,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-325, United States v. Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,17.504,19.255,"And I'm getting it, too, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,19.575,21.614,Either you or we.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,21.875,27.428,"Well, I take comfort in the thought that we're all suffering together here."
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.792,156.715,"So you're saying, in effect, even if you lose on the first question, you're entitled to some sort of relief on the second question?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,156.715,157.106,--Yes.
1995.95-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.096,193.641,"Well, do you agree that language doesn't always control, that something can be called a tax and, in fact, be a penalty?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,193.641,216.084,"--I agree that something can be called a tax that isn't, but there are two reasons why we think the designation of this tax as an excise tax is important, which I'll soon address, but I did want to make the point here that this tax does have the two features which are common to excise taxes, and by the way, excise taxes are probably the most common kind of tax there is."
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.084,221.717,"This section deals not just with the Federal Government, but with all governmental entities."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,221.717,224.429,"That's right, any State, Federal, or local excise tax."
1995.95-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.377,301.119,Because it was a nonpecuniary loss--
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,301.119,308.825,"A nonpecuniary loss penalty, which simply means that it's a penalty that doesn't recover money that would otherwise be owed, I guess."
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,330.45,330.789,"--Well, Mr.--"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,330.789,332.782,--that has a regulatory purpose is not.
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,332.782,346.86,"--Mr. Jones, it does have one qualification, and that is, it uses the word transaction, rather than act or event, and I mean, just in common uses that implies something more, doesn't it, than the passage of the deadline without payment?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,349.362,357.657,"The transaction language in that code is designed to key off the, if you will, statute of limitations that applies to excise tax claims."
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.079,360.93,Does it use the word transaction?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,360.93,361.54,--Does which?
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,361.54,363.821,Does the statute of limitations?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,363.821,367.033,"No, I didn't... I was not being precise."
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.304,417.095,"These taxes you say are excise taxes, that's well established?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,417.095,417.596,--Yes.
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.238,421.8,How is that established?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,421.8,429.925,"Well, it's not addressed in the briefs, Your Honor, but I think it's... it's established in the case law and treatises."
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.925,431.295,"Well, what cases?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,431.295,435.839,"I'm sorry, I'm not prepared... I don't have an answer to that question now."
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,464.78,468.611,Are you saying that all taxes appropriate to sovereignty are excise taxes?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,468.611,468.841,"--No, sir."
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.316,504.083,"So your theory is that the Court said customs, income, and excise taxes, and they were covering the waterfront there, and therefore if something isn't a customs duty and isn't an income tax, it is by definition an excise tax?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,504.083,507.686,I think that the point the Court was making was that these are broad and flexible terms.
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.76,517.984,"Well, what if a State had structured its tax scheme differently than the Federal Government?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,522.687,522.947,Yes.
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.947,529.512,--and the Federal Government doesn't get any bigger a break than the State does in trying to figure out whether it's an excise tax or not.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,529.512,545.831,"Well, I wouldn't say any bigger a break, but I do think that the Mansfield Tire court was probably right in saying that when Congress expressly designates something as an excise tax there's no reason to think it didn't intend to have its excises included within the priority that it adopted for excise taxes."
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.831,547.143,"Well, does that really make much sense?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,555.438,558.16,It makes sense if you think about it from two perspectives.
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.686,587.688,"Mr. Jones, the section doesn't purport to include all excise taxes."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,590.55,591.442,"Well, on--"
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.442,593.653,--and what is the transaction we're talking about here?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,593.653,598.345,--The transaction that we're talking about here is the act of maintaining an underfunded pension plan.
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.345,600.458,Act of maintaining over a period of time.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,600.458,600.768,That's right.
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,600.768,604.522,Not a... it talks about a transaction occurring on a specific date.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,604.522,607.531,"Well, the report on that is due on a specific date."
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,611.174,615.769,Isn't it the failure to fund on by that date which is the event?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,622.491,622.821,--It's the maintaining on the reporting date--
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,622.821,623.633,--on that reporting date.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,623.633,623.883,--Yes.
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.226,633.24,It seems to me a more natural term would be to describe that as an omission rather than a transaction.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,633.24,633.65,--Well--
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.65,637.551,"Or a failure rather than a trans... normally, a transaction is the event of death, or you sell something."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,637.792,638.293,--Well--
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.293,640.534,--it's an unusual use of the word transaction.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,641.185,647.499,"--It's a broad use of the word transaction, and you can only understand it in a broad context when you understand the broad concept of excises."
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,647.499,664.269,"--Of course, maybe the point for your side is that no one has come up with a reason why Congress would want to draw the line between an excise payable, excise tax payable on a failure to do something as distinct from an excise tax payable because of some affirmative action."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,664.269,664.519,Well--
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,664.519,665.551,"At least, I don't have an idea."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,665.551,668.783,--I don't think there's any reason to think Congress thought it was drawing such a line.
1995.95-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.256,684.121,"Mr. Jones, there is an additional so called tax under the ERISA scheme."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,701.575,710.11,The... there's a lot of issues that I want to talk about in answering that question.
1995.95-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,715.373,716.615,"Well, come on, we have to have that in mind."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,717.814,718.024,--I understand that.
1995.95-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,718.024,719.106,--and you know we're going to face it.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,719.106,732.775,"The United States has never pursued in an appellate court the question of the priority of the subsection (b) tax, and there are reasons to think that the treatment to be accorded to those taxes is different than the treatment to be accorded to the 10-percent priority."
1995.95-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,751.886,753.788,Which looks something like a penalty.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,753.788,758.121,"--Which would be, I suppose, a whopping big excise tax."
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.179,774.151,"Well, if an estate tax is an excise tax, certainly estate taxes are whopping big, 65 percent."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,774.151,775.043,"That's right, estate taxes can get very high."
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.736,783.178,More problematic than whopping big?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,783.178,783.548,--Yes.
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,815.589,820.121,Is the (b) tax expressly labeled an excise tax?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,820.121,823.734,"No, it's labeled... expressly labeled in the statute a tax."
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,823.734,826.755,"But it doesn't... the word excise is not in that section, is that right?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,826.755,828.966,"No, it's... nor is it... nor is it within the (a)--"
1995.95-325,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,828.966,830.468,"It's not in the other, the 10 percent, either."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,830.468,833.811,--Nor is it within the section that imposes most congressional excise taxes.
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,840.236,840.974,Which also applies to (b).
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,840.974,842.245,--Which also applies to (b).
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,842.245,844.516,"So if we buy (a), I think we're buying (b)."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,844.516,854.013,"Well, I'm... what I'm trying to say is, I think there are reasons why you would certainly want to reserve the question, but even if you were later to address it, there are reasons why you might draw a distinction."
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,854.013,854.324,Okay.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,860.278,882.962,"It's very important, and it's the... in the words of the legislative history, which I think are useful guides, it says, if Congress has expressly treated it as an excise, or has... or if it's commonly understood to be one, and so the question that I'm noting about the (b) tax is that, well, it hasn't been expressly treated as an excise when it's subject to waiver on any grounds the Secretary considers proper."
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,882.962,889.817,"--Okay, but one thing we can't do is adopt a rule of decision which says (a) has been designated by its location as an excise tax, end of issue."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,891.628,899.713,"You could, if you wished, use the language which the legislative history contains, which is what has been expressly treated as an excise by Congress."
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,899.713,902.545,"Well, depending on how narrowly you read that, this either is or is not--"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,902.545,902.815,Yes.
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.815,908.388,"--expressly treated, but we couldn't take the designation rule without picking up (b) as well, is that--"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,908.388,914.722,"I really don't mean to try to use the word designation as, as the one court said, a label."
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.297,927.632,"--Mr. Jones, could you help me, because I frankly... I had thought it was... this was expressly described as an excise tax, but it really is not, is it?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,937.048,940.22,"--Well, in terms of labeling, Congress located this within--"
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.22,942.091,It just located in the particular section--
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,942.091,945.955,"--In subtitle D, which is called Miscellaneous Excise Taxes."
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.297,954.008,--But your textual argument is that it's in a section of the code that's entitled Miscellaneous Excise Taxes.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,954.008,956.021,I'm not sure.
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.167,964.176,But this one doesn't have the word excise in it.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,964.176,965.267,"No, it doesn't, and very few do."
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.559,976.123,"Most of them are on a... you know, you can say you're being taxed on a specific event, like a death or a transaction or something, but this is a nonevent."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,979.286,979.656,There are--
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.656,980.157,"--of course, you don't--"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,980.157,986.569,--There are... there's an excise tax on maintaining a trust with excessive amounts of undistributed income.
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.682,992.963,"--But again... again, I don't want to just lose this one thought."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1003.743,1007.005,"That would be the only language, if you will, in the code."
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.005,1007.323,Yes.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1007.323,1010.326,"Now, in answering that question, let me point out something that we haven't addressed."
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.015,1022.182,Right.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1022.182,1025.395,We're not suggesting that this is a question of interpreting the statute.
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.108,1044.147,"Yes, but you're not willing to stand by the proposition, which sort of makes doubtful whether the proposition is correct... you're not willing to stand by the proposition that everything included within that title is an excise tax."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1044.147,1044.809,I think everything--
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.809,1049.011,"It happens to bear that title, but you're... well, the 100 percent tax you're willing to say is not."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1049.011,1056.205,"--Justice Scalia, what I've said is that to the extent that possible distinctions exist elsewhere, we're not trying to answer those questions,--"
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.205,1057.616,"Well, you have answered it--"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1057.616,1057.926,--and I've answered--
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.926,1063.091,"--if you're going to rely on the fact that this in a title that bears the caption, Excise Tax."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1075.518,1080.002,--We have to look for some evidence to answer the question of what is an excise tax.
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.002,1080.372,Okay.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1084.684,1087.587,"If Congress has expressly treated it as an excise, then it is, and all I'm--"
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1087.587,1088.097,"No, but that begs the question."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1118.617,1121.63,--Congress has done more than just locating it in this section.
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1136.52,1139.641,"No, but may I just interrupt you, because I want to get clear on one thing."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1158.943,1162.586,I have two answers to that.
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1163.706,1164.977,"No, it's yes or no."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1166.858,1170.631,--The Court could reach that decision.
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1176.825,1179.085,So I guess the answer is no.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1179.085,1179.325,--an excise--
1995.95-325,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1179.325,1180.206,I guess the answer is no.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1196.627,1197.788,--I think that's the test that Congress applies--
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.788,1198.8,"But it is correct, in your view--"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1198.8,1199.448,--in creating excise taxes.
1995.95-325,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.448,1202.092,--to apply a test to decide whether we think it's an excise tax.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1202.092,1205.573,"I think in deciding what's an excise tax, we should apply the test Congress applies, but may I please--"
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.573,1208.264,"Wait, but what test does Congress apply?"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1213.46,1213.778,--And then they made it waivable.
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.604,1232.18,"It seems to me once you abandon... once you're not willing to answer yes to Justice Souter's question, we're just quibbling about what the test ought to be, whether it's the four part test used here, or we should make up another one."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1232.18,1233.332,There's really another point--
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1233.332,1234.471,And there's really no alternative.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1234.722,1235.483,--There's another--
1995.95-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1235.483,1239.817,"--Can I ask a question... at some point, when you can... a technical question."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1239.817,1240.478,--May I just make one more point?
1995.95-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1240.478,1240.689,Yes.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1240.949,1241.34,Thank you.
1995.95-325,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1279.053,1280.002,That was a State tax.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1280.002,1281.254,"--No, sir, that was a Federal tax--"
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.254,1283.255,That was a... in this same section?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1283.255,1289.008,--That was a Federal employment tax that was designed to enforce a State unemployment contribution law.
1995.95-325,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.503,1295.884,Was it included in this same section of the code?
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1295.884,1302.047,"I believe the Federal employment taxes are in subtitle C, the immediately preceding section, which is also an excise tax."
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.633,1314.757,"What's the caption of subsection C, if subsection D is Miscellaneous Excise--"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1314.757,1316.106,I think it's called Employment Taxes.
1995.95-325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1316.106,1317.508,--Not Excise Taxes.
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1317.508,1318.318,That's not its caption.
1995.95-325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1318.318,1330.676,"Mr. Jones, one characteristic of many excise taxes is that they are deductible from income, and then that might be one way you could distinguish an excise tax from a penalty."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1338.542,1339.921,It's hard for me to answer that question.
1995.95-325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1343.724,1345.945,"--By the company, because it didn't make the contribution."
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1345.945,1346.546,This is owed by the employer.
1995.95-325,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.6,1361.376,"But how... is that something that can help us distinguish an excise tax from a penalty, excise taxes or--"
1995.95-325,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1361.376,1363.277,"Yes, I agree, that would be some evidence."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1583.121,1584.031,"It is, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.031,1584.942,Mr. McCardell.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1584.942,1587.413,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.369,1671.529,"Is there anything else that comes under sub (b) and therefore bears the label, Miscellaneous Excise Taxes, which you would assert is obviously not an excise tax, as you do the 100 percent, and as you do the 10 percent, for that matter?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1671.529,1679.074,"If I understand Your Honor's question, the only exaction under sub (b) is the 100 percent item designated as a tax."
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.074,1686.63,"Whatever comes within that section of the code that bears the caption, Miscellaneous Excise Taxes."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1690.503,1691.182,"Yes, there are, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.182,1697.386,What else besides this 10 percent and 100 percent strikes you as obviously not an excise tax?
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1697.386,1699.016,"Well, there are other tiered penalties."
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1720.06,1731.209,"Well, do you say that every exaction adopted under 26 U.S. Code section 4971, subtitle D, is a penalty, not a tax?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1731.209,1735.411,"We do, Your Honor, because both were asserted in this case."
1995.95-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.48,1767.33,To what extent are we bound by a concession like that?
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1773.525,1783.633,"Your Honor, the IRS did not come forward with any evidence in the bankruptcy court to satisfy the court's traditional test for the tax priority in bankruptcy."
1995.95-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.447,1796.72,"Well, it's one thing to be bound by a failure to offer proof, another thing to be bound by a concession."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1796.72,1798.773,And both occurred in this case.
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1806.587,1808.357,But that can't be the case.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1823.298,1824.389,"We do not, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1829.652,1838.178,"I mean, aren't there plenty of excise taxes that are designed for the very purpose of encouraging certain behavior, or discouraging certain behavior?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1838.178,1844.201,"--There are, and in the cases of those taxes they have a mixed purpose, both regulatory and to raise revenue."
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.716,1854.899,"Well, it raises revenue for Uncle Sam."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1854.899,1858.53,"--If it's ever paid, it certainly goes into the Treasury."
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.534,1865.285,But I think what--
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1892.133,1892.834,--Certainly.
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1996.242,1997.932,"Well, it doesn't call it a penalty."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,1997.932,1998.814,That's correct.
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1998.814,2000.123,"I mean, you're calling it a penalty."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2003.145,2007.218,"The test, Your Honor, is whether it qualifies as a tax."
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2011.272,2012.0,"Well, yes."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2014.303,2028.132,"--The test is that stated in United States v. New York, that a tax is a pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for the purpose of supporting the Government, by whatever name it may be called."
1995.95-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.792,2043.733,"Mr. McCardell, I don't know why the issue isn't... forgetting these general tests about taxes and penalties, why isn't the issue simply whether it's a... whether you call it a tax or a penalty, it is imposed on a transaction occurring on a certain date."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2047.165,2058.743,"If the Court addresses the question of transaction, which we think it should, because that is encompassed within the question before the Court today, it's an element of qualifying for tax priority, the IRS loses."
1995.95-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.313,2080.315,"Well, they would say... I think Mr. Jones would say, well, the statute imposed an obligation to file... make a determination as of the end of the plan year and know exactly what the underfunding was, and I suppose the transaction might be described as making a determination with red figures in it... bing... and then you pay 10 percent of the red figure."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2080.315,2094.016,"The IRS's proof of claim in this case identified when this tax arose, and that date was September 15, 1990, at the end of that day, when no payment was made... at midnight on September 15, 1990."
1995.95-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.201,2103.891,"I take it that's the end of the plan year, that--"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2103.891,2109.815,"That's the end of the period within which the debtor could have made that final payment, and in between those two--"
1995.95-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.815,2112.088,--Was that the end of the plan year?
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2113.198,2113.548,--Yes.
1995.95-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.548,2115.538,"--Because they use the term plan year, I think, in the statute."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2115.538,2115.778,Yes.
1995.95-325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.785,2130.548,"So they treated the transaction date as the date the payment was due, rather than the date the determination was made."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2130.548,2132.31,"That's what their proof of claim says, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2132.31,2152.994,"Why would Congress want to draw that distinction between a tax which becomes payable as a result of nonaction and the expiration of time, and the tax which becomes payable because of an affirmative act, or perhaps even an affirmative agreement, if that's applied by one sense, a transaction."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2154.705,2174.369,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, but it's apparent from the language of section 507(a)(7)(E) that that line, indeed, was drawn because of the language, transaction occurring, and perhaps it's based on the distinction the Solicitor General points to that most excise taxes are based on an act or event, or a transaction."
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.369,2178.74,"Well now, wait, act or event or transaction, you're willing to read transaction to include event?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2178.74,2179.582,We are not.
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.582,2181.512,You're not willing to include it.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2183.224,2183.433,Nor--
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.433,2184.144,Not an act.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2184.144,2184.785,"--Nor an act, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.785,2193.3,It has to be... a transaction involves... you then do not think that estate taxes are excise taxes.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2193.3,2210.68,"I wondered that as I studied for this case, Your Honor, and although it's not cited in the briefs and I don't have the statute here today, my recollection of the estate tax statute is that it's imposed on the transfer into the estate, which is a transaction."
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.68,2225.41,"If I impose a tax on the sale of, or the purchase of jewelry, that would be an excise tax, but if I impose a tax on the ownership of jewelry, that would not be an excise tax."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2225.41,2226.822,Under the ordinary standard--
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.822,2227.761,"I mean, above a certain amount."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2230.395,2232.727,"--Ordinarily, it would be understood as a property tax."
1995.95-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.727,2233.107,--A property tax.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2235.749,2238.633,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2238.633,2243.776,How is the transfer of property into an estate the result of a transaction?
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2264.379,2274.925,"There is an exchange in the sense of the death creates an estate, and to the estate goes the decedent's property, and that is described in the code as a transfer."
1995.95-325,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2274.925,2277.196,But we're getting a little bit attenuated.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2277.196,2288.085,"Yes, Your Honor, and with regard to the section 4971 imposition, it's made not based on any transaction, simply in this case on the failure to make a payment."
1995.95-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2288.085,2292.679,"Mr. McCardell, do you know the answer to my question about the deductibility of this?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2292.679,2293.32,"I do, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2300.294,2309.519,"There's a whole slew under these miscellaneous excise taxes, and I know one has to do with charitable foundations."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2322.349,2322.649,That's true.
1995.95-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2322.649,2342.352,"I'm trying to understand what else, since this is... there are many, many things that come under this huge title, would be affected by our answer to the question in the context of 4971, what other animals there are like it in this collection."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2342.352,2348.687,"There are very few just like this one, because this one is imposed only when another statute is violated."
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2372.812,2381.407,"May I ask you this, are all taxes deductible by the person paying the taxes if they're engaged in business?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2381.407,2391.512,"Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code, which we have addressed in our brief, generally provides for the deductibility of taxes but not penalties."
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2391.512,2392.894,And penalties are not.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2392.894,2394.026,That's correct.
1995.95-325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2394.026,2403.971,And it's your position that neither the 10-percent exaction nor the 100-percent exaction in this ERISA section are deductible.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2403.971,2404.612,That's correct.
1995.95-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.523,2415.04,The Government suggested that as to the 100-percent tax it has an equitable component within the tax.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2420.384,2422.294,That is a distinction--
1995.95-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2422.294,2431.45,"Are there any other taxes that are in the excise subtitle that have this equitable waiver, or equitable feature built into them?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2431.45,2432.97,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.369,2464.592,"Well, I don't... I think the Government would tell you that it has no discretion to waive its taxes, other than in the one instance we're discussing, the 100-percent tax, and so it would seem to me plausible enough for the bankruptcy court to say, well, there's an equitable component to this tax which can be waived, and I am going to equitably subordinate it."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2464.592,2468.794,"--And that, in fact, did occur in this case."
1995.95-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.895,2470.827,As to the 100 percent.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2470.827,2476.069,--did subordinate under section 510(c) both the 100-percent and the 10-percent penalties.
1995.95-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2476.069,2482.263,"But that would at least be an excise tax that has an equitable component, which is not like other excise taxes."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2482.263,2488.127,It's true that the... only the (b) portion of this exaction is waivable by the Government.
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.127,2500.975,"Can I ask the same question I asked the Solicitor General, because assuming that I agreed with you, assuming for the sake of argument that I agreed it was not a tax, but rather it was a penalty, because it collects zero dollars as its objective."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2542.642,2543.563,It's--
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.563,2548.746,--but I would like to know what you think of that particular argument.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2577.514,2593.396,"--Those cases do not stand for that proposition, Your Honor, and I should acknowledge that this... in this case, the IRS's claim was subordinated in two independent ways, not just equitable subordination under 510(c), but also was subordinated under the plan."
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.795,2608.005,All right.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2639.374,2649.342,"--Your Honor, the Court need not look to equitable grounds if it reaches that question, because two statutes in Chapter 11 both permitted and required the subordination that occurred here."
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.342,2652.223,"You didn't really argue... I mean, it's come up here under this other pretense."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2659.469,2664.352,"The court of appeals affirmed the confirmation order, which is one of the three orders."
1995.95-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2739.161,2748.498,"Mr. McCardell, do I understand correctly that you are not making the argument that was made in the prior case?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2763.546,2773.934,"We're not saying that, Your Honor, and that's because Chapter 11 has a specific requirement that a Chapter 11 plan pay in full all taxes, which this plan says it will do."
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.484,2880.533,"You know, Sheppard's Tax Dictionary does have a definition for minimum funding excise tax which, it refers to this particular provision, so the tax community as reflected by the tax dictionary calls it an excise tax."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2880.533,2897.384,"Your Honor, it certainly has been treated in various ways as an excise tax, but not even the tax practitioners would agree that a tax of this nature is a tax for all purposes under the Internal Revenue Code."
1995.95-325,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2926.733,2932.837,"Mr. McCardell, I understand the big difference it makes in the bankruptcy context whether it's classified as one or the other."
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2944.976,2965.137,"I don't know that it does make a difference, Your Honor, although, as I said in addressing taxes of this... penalty excise taxes of this nature, the Third and Eighth Circuits have disagreed on the question of whether they are taxes even for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code's provisions calculating interest on those taxes."
1995.95-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2965.137,2978.648,There's some discussion in the briefs... I think it's 507(a)(7)(G)... relating to a penalty related to a claim of a kind specified in this paragraph and in compensation for actual pecuniary loss.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2978.648,2979.226,Yes.
1995.95-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2979.226,2980.278,Can you give me an example--
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2980.278,2981.439,"Yes, I can."
1995.95-325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2981.439,2984.92,--of a tax to which that would apply?
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,2984.92,2985.581,"I can, Your Honor."
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3019.534,3037.617,"Is... withholding taxes, that's... is that... the corporation withholds its employees taxes, then it doesn't pay them, and the person who owes the tax is the employee, and the code refers to the money that the corporation should have withheld, which, of course, is the tax that the employee owed, as a penalty, is that right?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,3037.617,3039.186,--That's correct.
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3039.186,3040.889,And that's the idea of pecuniary penalties?
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,3040.889,3045.872,It's what the Government would have received if the law had been... the tax that would have been collected if the law had been obeyed.
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3045.872,3055.816,"And so the only things that are pecuniary penalties are these instances where a corporation is to withhold a tax that somebody else owes, and the code refers to that as a penalty, or those as penalties?"
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,3055.816,3066.175,"I can think of another example of possible pecuniary loss penalty, and that is an exaction under the Internal Revenue Code that simply represents interest on a tax that should have been paid and compensates--"
1995.95-325,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.175,3066.435,Yes.
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,3066.435,3067.376,--for the delay in payment.
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.666,3097.337,They're required to fund them?
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,3097.337,3098.025,"Yes, they are."
1995.95-325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3100.088,3102.179,Is there any other penalty for not funding them?
1995.95-325,1,41754,steven_jack_mccardell,,3102.179,3118.789,"They... there's no criminal penalty, Your Honor, but that under section 502 of ERISA the failure to fund may be enforced by a civil action, including injunctive proceedings, so that it is a statutory obligation which, if violated, gives rise to these escalating penalties."
1995.95-325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.165,3192.236,"Thank you, Mr. McCardell."
1995.95-325,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3194.119,3195.208,I have two brief points I want to make.
1995.95-325,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3233.283,3246.994,"Mr. Jones, do you know whether it makes any difference for the IRC purposes alone, forgetting bankruptcy, whether something is labeled excise or penalty, assuming... forgetting about the deductibility, because this one is not deductible."
1995.95-325,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3246.994,3249.135,"--You mean, in applying the excise tax priority?"
1995.95-325,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3249.135,3250.086,That... no.
1995.95-325,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3250.517,3251.138,I'm sorry.
1995.95-325,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3251.138,3251.446,--Forget bankruptcy.
1995.95-325,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3258.812,3264.225,"Other than what we've already discussed, I'm not familiar with any circumstances."
1995.95-325,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3300.629,3301.647,They don't insure all of them.
1995.95-325,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3306.282,3308.553,"--That's... but for the insurance, they wouldn't be paid at all."
1995.95-325,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3308.553,3309.254,Without insurance.
1995.95-325,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3309.254,3310.334,"Oh, without--"
1995.95-325,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3310.334,3317.519,"That is to say, aren't there some people here, employees, who won't get paid, and the reason they won't get paid their promised benefit is because the IRS is going to collect this tax?"
1995.95-325,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3317.519,3317.91,"--No, sir."
1995.95-325,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3336.921,3337.382,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
1995.95-325,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3337.382,3337.582,Thank you.
1995.95-325,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3337.582,3338.373,The case is submitted.
