1977.76-6942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.738,We will hear arguments next in Lakeside v. Oregon.
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,46.883,49.875,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,257.325,261.36,"Well, that goes to every time a judge overrules an objection?"
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,261.36,262.796,No.
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,262.796,265.044,Where would the line be?
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,265.044,288.798,"First of all it is obvious, if there is a legal basis for the judge’s decision, for instance, let us say in the course of the trial a lawyer tries to put on perjury testimony or tries to put on testimony which violates the heresy rule, in that case the judge would have to interfere with the trial strategy of the defendant because that trial strategy would be illegal."
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,301.236,305.073,And what case you have that is really close to that?
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,305.073,306.227,In --
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,306.227,307.96,Any place?
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,307.96,315.931,"Well, I cited in my brief the Geders case and the Brooks v. Tennessee case --"
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,315.931,322.191,I do not know anything in that case that said when you object on question that in effect of counsel?
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,322.191,323.874,Okay.
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,333.862,335.051,That is your first point.
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,339.265,339.561,No.
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,339.561,340.922,Which one do you have on the Sixth Amendment?
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,340.922,341.239,Right.
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,358.066,370.396,Your general language is that if a judge gives an instruction over the objection of the defendant’s counsel that is violation of the Sixth Amendment?
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,370.396,371.465,That is correct.
1977.76-6942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.465,393.724,"Following up my brother Marshall's question, supposing the judge at the close of trial said, “I am going to give an instruction on reasonable doubt and that the defendant is entitled to the benefit of a presumption of innocence and his counsel objected to be giving a bad instruction,” would you be making the same point here?"
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,393.724,402.921,"Well, I think my basic position is that I do not know if the two situations are analogous and --"
1977.76-6942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.921,405.496,"If there are not analogous, why are they not?"
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,405.496,471.78,"Our position is that the assistance that the attorney gave here was to advise the client on the exercise of another constitutional right, a constitutional right not to take the stand and that the trial attorney and the petitioner’s position in this should be honored by the Court unless there is some legal basis for the Court’s intervention and the reason I cited the Geders case and the Brooks case was because in those cases, the Court said in Brooks that ordinarily the judge does have a right to figure out what the order of proof will be and in Geders ordinarily a trial judge can decide when witnesses should be sequestered, but then the Court went ahead and said that if there is a conflict between these ordinary powers of the Court and the Sixth Amendment, that the Sixth Amendment should prevail and that the trial judge should not interfere with this assistance that the defendant is getting from his lawyer."
1977.76-6942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,514.937,517.764,"Mr. Margolin, let me put in another way."
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,522.837,528.144,"Oh! Sure, of course."
1977.76-6942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,530.611,557.086,"What would you say if the defense counsel had asked for precisely this instruction and the Court said, “Oh! No, I do not dare give that,” the Supreme Court does not like that sort of thing and then he is convicted and goes on appeal saying he had asked for the Court to instruct the jury on a constitutional right and what about that?"
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,557.086,560.926,"Okay, you mean something like in Bruno except on constitutional grounds."
1977.76-6942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,647.02,651.041,I am not sure all defense lawyers would agree with you on that proposition?
1977.76-6942,0,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,651.041,681.606,"Well, I am just saying that one point I think should make here also is that because every case has a different set of facts, I think that this Court should have faith in the attorney who lives with the case, who is prepared it for months and who conducts a voir dire and gets a chance to size up the jurors who are going to be sitting on the individual case and let him make the type of decision as to whether or not that in this particular case the instruction should be given or should not be given."
1977.76-6942,1,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1291.525,1293.855,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-6942,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.944,1376.546,Am I correct that the reason he did not take the stand was because he did not want all of this known?
1977.76-6942,1,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1376.546,1380.771,"Mr. Justice Marshall, that seems to be the argument, but the fact is it all came out."
1977.76-6942,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1380.771,1383.339,But why are you just flaunting it around?
1977.76-6942,1,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1383.339,1389.659,I am not flaunting at around improperly Mr. Justice Marshall I believe because my point is the jury heard all of this.
1977.76-6942,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1395.559,1397.509,Oh! I did not (Inaudible).
1977.76-6942,1,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1397.509,1402.534,"Yes, that is my point."
1977.76-6942,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.417,1546.208,I take if this is all in the record?
1977.76-6942,1,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1546.208,1547.417,This is all in the record.
1977.76-6942,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.417,1549.25,As part of his defense?
1977.76-6942,1,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1549.25,1549.579,No.
1977.76-6942,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1549.579,1551.03,Then part of his prosecution?
1977.76-6942,1,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1551.03,1555.82,"It was all brought up, all of that I have said so far was brought up in the prosecution’s case."
1977.76-6942,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.033,1614.965,And all this I take it leading up to the suggestion that it was an assistance and aid and help him to get this instruction?
1977.76-6942,1,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1614.965,1616.694,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-6942,2,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,2123.429,2126.492,"Yes, two short things Your Honor."
1977.76-6942,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2196.033,2229.922,"What if a judge in precisely the situation that as Circuit Court judge was here and presented with your client’s attorney’s objection to giving his instruction and said I know that there will be a claim of constitutional violation if I do not give the instruction, if I do give the instruction, the claim that you are now making here, I fear if I do not give it up your plan of incompetent assistance of counsel?"
1977.76-6942,2,38148,phillip_m_margolin,,2229.922,2248.248,"Well, I think you waive that type of a defense or probably that type of a opposing claim or appeal if there is a specific request, you may not to give the instruction."
