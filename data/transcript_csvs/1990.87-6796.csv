1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.926,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-6796, James A. Ford v. Georgia."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,9.728,23.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,121.107,136.298,"Can there be any quibble, counsel, over whether or not it's clear that a Fourteenth Amendment Swain claim was raised, as opposed to a Sixth Amendment fair cross-section of the community?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,138.841,142.243,"Justice Kennedy, the record is unmistakably clear on that point."
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.164,159.265,"What, what about at the trial?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,159.265,167.633,"--It was pretrial, we submit, that on the... in the pretrial motion it was clear that he was raising a Fourteenth Amendment claim, as well as a Sixth Amendment claim."
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,167.633,169.944,Because he mentioned the Swain case?
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,169.944,181.394,"Because he mentioned the Swain case, because what he was asking for in this particular case was to restrict the prosecutor's ability to strike black jurors without giving any reasons, and that he should be required to give reasons."
1990.87-6796,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.266,195.372,"Mr. Ogletree, is it your position that all Swain claims are necessarily Batson claims as well?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,201.576,206.929,"Well, that has been a central issue in this case, Justice O'Connor."
1990.87-6796,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.929,209.791,I just wonder what your position was on that.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,209.791,223.41,"The position is that Swain claim... we submit that Swain claims and Batson claims are similar in that Batson, in our interpretation of what this Court did, was to relieve the enormous evidentiary burden that Swain established, and to say if you raise a valid, legitimate--"
1990.87-6796,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.41,232.476,"Well, so your answer to me is you say that Swain... all Swain claims necessarily include a Batson claim?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,232.476,232.845,--Yes.
1990.87-6796,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.845,233.206,In effect.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,233.778,235.49,We would submit on this record that it's even more than that.
1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.75,274.408,"Mr. Ogletree, will you take a look at page 4 of the joint appendix, which has the fourth paragraph, I believe, of the motion that you have been referring to?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,274.408,274.599,Yes.
1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.599,283.855,And it... there it says the exclusion of members of the black race in the jury when a black accused is being tried will receive ex... or... et cetera.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,291.131,291.471,That's correct.
1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.471,293.053,--and Taylor v. Louisiana.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,297.547,298.757,"That is correct, Chief... Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.334,329.638,"Where... where did, where did the... where did the petitioner's lawyer in terms use the words Fourteenth Amendment or Equal Protection Clause?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,329.638,332.119,--The counsel did not use those terms explicitly.
1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,345.65,347.31,"And what, what law did he rely on?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,348.952,353.464,"All he relied on in the pretrial argument was what was existent then, both Swain--"
1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.464,354.686,Did he say Swain?
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,354.686,356.586,"--He did not, but in fact the prosecutor did."
1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.023,368.165,He took it as a Swain... the prosecutor took it as a Swain claim.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,368.165,369.936,"Not only the prosecutor, but the court did as well."
1990.87-6796,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,414.537,417.579,"Well, certainly the lower courts all took the issue up, didn't they?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,417.579,418.3,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,444.251,445.423,I hope you can get to the merits.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,445.423,446.263,Pardon me?
1990.87-6796,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,446.263,448.165,I hope you can get to the merits.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,448.165,449.844,In the--
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.844,462.192,"Mr. Ogletree, before you do get to the merits, what... what... what reliance upon Swain by the prosecution are you referring to?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,463.454,464.085,--In the joint--
1990.87-6796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.085,466.607,--Are you referring to page 11 of the joint appendix?
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,469.749,471.339,"--That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1990.87-6796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.339,471.499,--sort of tangential.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,491.733,501.118,"Well, Your Honor, I think it's clear that both the nature of the motion, the way the court understood it, the way the Georgia Supreme Court understood it, the way the prosecutor responded here--"
1990.87-6796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.118,501.498,What about the trial court?
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,507.194,521.856,--The... what the trial court did in effect was to say that in light of what you have argued I am taking into consideration among other things that prosecutor should not be required to show that there should be restrictions on the racial use of peremptory challenges.
1990.87-6796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.668,532.605,"On page 17 of the joint appendix, the defense counsel... seems to me to refer to the Sixth Amendment."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,541.05,541.62,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.105,586.411,"Mr. Ogletree, at any time in these proceedings, has either any Georgia judge or a Georgia prosecutor taken the position that you waived the claim because you only argued the Sixth Amendment?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,586.411,587.072,"No, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.072,588.714,"No, but this is just brand new up here."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,588.714,589.915,"That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.538,624.239,"But even, even then they didn't rely on the fact that it was a confusion between the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,624.239,624.77,That's exactly right.
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.77,629.385,It was a procedural failure to make a motion at the time they decided that it should have been made.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,629.385,630.546,That... that's precisely right.
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1006.576,1006.776,Mr.--
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1029.784,1035.38,"No, I... I would just simply ask the court to, in light of this record, to remand the case."
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.122,1054.72,But do you... do you have any authority for us to require the Georgia court to hear a Federal substantive claim if it has a procedural bar rule of its own?
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1061.285,1061.425,--That is right.
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1061.716,1063.826,Rather than requiring Georgia to--
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1063.826,1065.828,For the purpose of requiring Georgia to reach it.
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1067.44,1070.682,--So this would be... so this would be an extension of our precedents?
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1070.682,1074.165,"I am not sure it would be an extension under these circumstances, Justice Kennedy."
1990.87-6796,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.44,1098.291,"And there, that there must be a Batson hearing."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1098.291,1098.862,Pardon me?
1990.87-6796,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.862,1101.163,And that there must be a Batson hearing.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1101.163,1101.864,That's exactly right.
1990.87-6796,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.864,1103.737,Which we certainly wouldn't undertake.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1103.737,1104.127,Right.
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1104.127,1112.653,"Well, do we have enough in this record to say that there was a Batson violation in not asking the prosecutor to state the grounds?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1112.653,1114.713,"I, I think... I don't think you have to reach that."
1990.87-6796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1127.926,1129.515,"Well, why isn't that sufficient for us to do that right here?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1136.89,1145.756,"I guess the question would be whether or not the Court is asking, in light of what Batson now requires, whether you can go and decide the entire issue."
1990.87-6796,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.756,1149.266,The prosecutor should have a chance to--
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1149.266,1150.107,To respond and rebut.
1990.87-6796,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.107,1151.73,--to explain what his strikes were all about.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1151.73,1164.86,"In fact, in this case the reason that I think the record is so clear, that the record is adequately preserved, the prosecutor at the time of the colloquy during trial was prepared to give reasons, and present to the court... may I give reasons, do I need to give reasons for my strikes."
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.219,1193.518,"Mr. Ogletree, are you implicitly arguing, this is kind of a follow-up on Justice Kennedy's question, that when the record merely shows that 9 out of 10 eligible blacks were struck from the jury, that is sufficient to raise a Batson issue which requires the explanation?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1193.518,1210.141,"--I think it certainly is sufficient to at least raise the issue, and certainly in circumstances like this, Justice Stevens, where it is clear that counsel, based on the court's earlier ruling, was not allowed to object to it and make whatever arguments and make the prosecutor explain."
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.135,1226.583,"But what I'm suggesting is, supposing you made the same motion and all the rest, but the record also showed that there were 10 blacks on the panel, and they all got on the petit jury."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1229.005,1229.345,That's true.
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1230.447,1241.163,"So I think inevitably we have to be considering whether the fact that the record shows that 9 out of 10 eligible jurors were stricken and they are all of the same race, that that at least raises enough for further inquiry."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1241.163,1241.383,Right.
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.292,1262.727,"Well, should we say here that there was enough for an inquiry, and then remand it for such further proceedings as may be consistent with that finding?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1262.727,1269.622,"That certainly is what I would like to see happen, if this Court would entertain that, particularly in light of this record."
1990.87-6796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.657,1283.061,"Mr. Ogletree, here's a problem, and I think this is sort of related to Justice Kennedy's question as to whether we should do it here or send it back."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1316.124,1316.933,--I think--
1990.87-6796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.933,1324.88,"Now, I can understand our saying that's fine for Georgia, but you can't preclude Federal review on the basis of that new rule."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1329.232,1338.487,"--I think this Court... I think the Georgia Supreme Court and the rules it outlined in Sparks are totally appropriate, and it clearly was a clear rule, a new rule."
1990.87-6796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.497,1356.893,"But Sparks was prospective, so you are saying all the rules that Georgia makes have to be prospective."
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1356.893,1357.413,"I think that... no, no."
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.09,1408.862,"Mr. Ogletree, do you say that Sparks, in his case he, the rule was not applied to him?"
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1408.862,1410.534,"It was not applied to him, Justice Stevens."
1990.87-6796,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.534,1410.724,I see.
1990.87-6796,0,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,1410.724,1421.643,"It's the most incredible set of circumstances that not only was it not applied to him, the court says it's prospective, it says that we had no guidelines before, but Sparks gets the benefit of it."
1990.87-6796,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.935,1468.895,"Thank you, Mr. Ogletree."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1470.447,1478.213,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.811,1528.228,"Ms. Smith, the Supreme Court of Georgia did decide that the petitioner here had adequately made a Swain claim."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1528.228,1531.369,"--That apparently is the treatment it was given on the first direct appeal, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1531.369,1537.564,"And they say in their opinion on remand, too, I think, that he raised a Swain claim."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1537.564,1538.476,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.476,1554.907,"Now, is it your position that after Batson people who simply had raised a Swain claim in the lower courts are not entitled to, even though their appeals had not become final, are not entitled to have their case reconsidered under Batson?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1554.907,1562.802,"That is our position, Your Honor, because of the lack of objection in this case to the manner in which the prosecutor used his strikes on the petit jury."
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1581.365,1591.273,"Do you... do you think your... the view you're expressing now is consistent with the Court's opinion in Griffith, where it remanded cases to the Supreme Court of Kentucky and to the Tenth Circuit?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1591.273,1592.952,"We submit that it is, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.989,1605.824,You think they had made actual Batson-type objection rather than Swain-type objections?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1605.824,1618.361,"--From a reading of the opinions, Your Honor, it is clear that after the jury had been selected in their respective cases, some sort of objection or motion evidencing dissatisfaction with the strikes used in that case was made."
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.361,1620.474,"Well, but you can say the same here, can't you?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1626.521,1628.741,"But it was before the strikes had been utilized, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.725,1648.435,"Well, if the same objection that he made before trial, literally, was made... had been made just before the jury was sworn, would you say that he had made a Batson objection?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1648.435,1657.662,"That is what the Georgia Supreme Court held in this case, Your Honor, because he was... we feel that it was incumbent upon him to object when the conduct occurred--"
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.662,1664.265,"Yes, but suppose, suppose the... just before the jury was sworn in this case... and I guess the jury was all white except one?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1664.265,1665.547,"--That is what the record shows, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.547,1667.748,And there had been 10 strikes at blacks?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1667.748,1670.161,"Nine by the prosecution, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.161,1670.289,"Nine, yes."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1679.585,1680.987,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.987,1682.69,"--Now that would have been a Batson objection, wouldn't it?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1682.69,1684.072,That would have been a Batson objection.
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.109,1699.062,"And it would have... and the fact of striking nine blacks would have, would have been a satisfactory basis for making the profit... for making the prosecutor say--"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1699.062,1702.381,--I can't go to the merits at this point.
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.906,1714.031,"--No, I understand, you say... you say that his pretrial objection was not sufficient."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1714.031,1715.011,It was not sufficient.
1990.87-6796,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1718.755,1727.439,"Well, do I understand that you take the position that because it was made pretrial, it was a Swain claim, not a Batson claim?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1737.597,1738.808,"Well, Your Honor, I think that--"
1990.87-6796,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1738.808,1742.449,Do I understand that was your response to Justice White?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1742.449,1744.442,--In... hypothetically speaking--
1990.87-6796,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1744.442,1744.572,I thought it was.
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1744.572,1745.233,"--yes, it is."
1990.87-6796,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1781.501,1783.554,Do you think the trial judge was misled?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1783.554,1787.187,"I don't think there's a question as to that, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1789.599,1789.739,Say that again?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1789.739,1798.287,"--I don't think that there is any evidence that he was misled up until the motion for new trial hearing, when it was asserted by new counsel that the motion had been renewed and--"
1990.87-6796,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1798.287,1801.219,"Well, isn't that the whole point of procedural bars and things?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1801.219,1805.609,"--I think that there are various purposes of procedural bars, Your Honor, and that is to prevent--"
1990.87-6796,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1805.609,1807.061,"Well, on this procedural bar."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1807.061,1809.053,--I... I--
1990.87-6796,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1809.053,1811.193,"The trial judge certainly was not misled, was he?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1811.193,1816.527,"--I don't think that the judge was misled, but we submit that that does not excuse the... the petitioner's conduct."
1990.87-6796,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1816.527,1816.977,"Well, this is a capital case, is it not?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1816.977,1817.848,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1817.848,1825.984,"Ms. Smith, now the first time this case went to the Georgia Supreme Court, it didn't find a procedural bar, is that right?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1825.984,1827.015,"It did not, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.422,1849.611,In 1988 the Georgia Supreme Court in Cherry against Abbott appeared to say that Swain and Batson claims raised the same issue.
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1849.611,1855.996,--They found that the failure to object in Cherry was... did not satisfy cause.
1990.87-6796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.884,1874.229,"Ms. Smith, wouldn't the same problem of prematurity exist for a Swain claim as would exist for a Batson claim?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1888.547,1890.169,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.169,1890.32,Why?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1890.32,1897.666,"Apparently the Georgia Supreme Court had not focused upon that distinction because, as Swain itself notes, that what occurs in the case at hand is not sufficient--"
1990.87-6796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.666,1897.786,"Excuse me, excuse me."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1901.809,1907.213,--What occurs in the case at hand in Swain is not sufficient to overcome the presumption.
1990.87-6796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.181,1922.993,"You would have a Swain claim even if the prosection strikes no blacks, in your case?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1922.993,1929.368,--It depends on whether or not he can establish systematic exclusion.
1990.87-6796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.368,1929.508,"No, it doesn't depend on that at all."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1930.828,1931.769,I don't think--
1990.87-6796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.769,1937.984,Which means that your Swain claim is just as premature if you make it before the actual empaneling of the jury as would be your Batson claim.
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1937.984,1938.715,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.162,1949.063,"Not sufficient, but necessary, at least."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1949.063,1953.957,"--I would think that that would be one more element of the defendant's proof, but is not dispositive either way."
1990.87-6796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1953.957,1963.183,"Gee, I think it's extraordinary that you, you have a claim... a case in which the prosecutor strikes no blacks from the jury at all, and you nonetheless have a Swain claim."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,1972.959,1978.274,"I think had he attempted to establish systematic exclusion at that point, Your Honor, he might have prevailed on a Swain claim."
1990.87-6796,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.902,2077.174,May I ask this question?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2118.202,2122.136,"--I will state, Your Honor, that we simply cannot know, because it was not made."
1990.87-6796,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2172.971,2179.064,"Well, Ms. Smith, what about the prosecutor recognizing Swain?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2183.068,2183.919,"Yes, he did, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.919,2185.922,"Well, what's your answer to that?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2185.922,2190.324,"We submit that Swain, as a question of fact, is not the same as Batson."
1990.87-6796,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.396,2192.598,And what is the difference?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2192.598,2202.175,"--Swain allows a defendant to try to establish a systematic pattern of exclusion by the prosecutor in case after case, no matter the defendant."
1990.87-6796,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.882,2214.253,"If we should disagree with you, you lose."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2214.253,2216.874,"Apparently so, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2216.874,2217.445,Thank you.
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2235.537,2236.198,We submit--
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.198,2242.213,"I mean at the time... at the time he was tried, what was... where do you find the rule?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2242.213,2253.161,"--We cited in our brief both the unified appeal procedure, which was followed in this case and which the court itself cites in the first appeal of this case regarding failure to preserve issues for lack of objection."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.827,2268.969,"Well, the trial court certainly didn't say that his pretrial motion was premature."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2270.141,2273.974,"Under Swain, and that is not inconsistent with Georgia law on this point, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.974,2276.706,So the trial court shouldn't have ruled on it?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2277.876,2283.78,I think for a Swain claim it didn't... that distinction was not in existence in Georgia law.
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.354,2288.674,For a Swain claim you could have made it pretrial?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2288.674,2290.796,"--Apparently under Georgia law you could, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.058,2313.9,"Well, if you... and if the Swain claim is enough to raise an equal protection claim, which it is, and if it's enough to raise a Batson claim, how was he supposed to know that he was... that he was to renew his Swain claim before the jury was sworn?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2313.9,2325.688,"--Because he was raising both Swain and a Sixth Amendment claim, Your Honor, and we submit that it is his raising of the Sixth Amendment claim that evidenced his intent to focus upon the petit jury that required him to--"
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.688,2333.044,"So if his motion had just cited Swain and the equal protection clause, that would have been consistent with Georgia law at the time?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2334.614,2335.215,"--I... yes, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.215,2337.608,And he would not have had to renew it before the jury was sworn?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2337.608,2340.16,Georgia law has not made that distinction.
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.16,2348.366,"And yet the Supreme Court of Georgia in its opinion, I believe both the first opinion and the opinion on remand, said that he did raise a Swain claim."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2348.366,2363.186,"It, it... looking at... there are four paragraphs in the motion, and looking at, he alleges in paragraph 2, he alleges systematic exclusion without citing Swain, and in paragraph 4 of the motion he also cites McCray and Taylor and Sixth Amendment as well."
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2363.186,2378.087,"Well, but can't we regard the Supreme Court of Georgia saying that he raised a Swain claim and indicating not that there was any procedural bar in connection with the Swain claim, as the final word on Georgia law that he did properly raise a Swain claim?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2378.087,2378.557,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.44,2437.237,"So, you are not urging that the... that the... that the rule laid down in Sparks... is that it?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2437.687,2438.158,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.158,2439.911,Is applicable in this case?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2439.911,2447.955,We submit that they merely relied upon Sparks because they had already decided in Sparks itself when a claim would or would not be timely.
1990.87-6796,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.862,2463.256,And that the court would have come out the same way if that had never... had never decided Sparks?
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2463.256,2465.346,"--I submit that it would have, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2473.333,2480.589,"Ms. Smith, I didn't realize this before, but your opponent says that Sparks was not procedurally defaulted."
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2480.96,2482.232,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.87-6796,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.232,2485.815,"Now, what did he do that this, this litigant did not do?"
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2485.815,2490.99,He made a motion for mistrial after the prosecutor used his strikes in this case.
1990.87-6796,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2495.853,2496.113,I see.
1990.87-6796,1,38324,paula_k_smith,,2498.066,2498.577,It was the motion for mistrial.
1990.87-6796,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.004,2611.737,"Thank you, Ms. Smith."
1990.87-6796,2,19743,charles_j_ogletree_jr,,2613.327,2620.282,Mr. Chief Justice.
1990.87-6796,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.92,2760.353,"Thank you, Mr. Ogletree."
