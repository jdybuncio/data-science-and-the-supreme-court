1986.85-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.254,We will hear arguments next in Burke against Barnes.
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,55.401,63.073,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,246.36,255.532,"May I just ask you on that, what about the argument they make about some auditing consequences about whether compliance with the bill would have had fiscal consequences?"
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,255.532,273.41,"Justice Stevens, it's our view that these collateral consequences, or asserted collateral consequences, do not involve the parties before the Court in this case, and thus, do not provide a basis for avoiding mootness; that the dispute would involve the Secretary of State, allegedly, or the Controller General, neither of whom are parties here."
1986.85-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.047,311.535,"It seems to me that your argument... and you may be right, of course... that your argument on mootness really merges with your argument on standing, and that if you're right on mootness, it's because you're right on standing."
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,311.535,315.004,"--I think there is much truth to that, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.949,360.468,And then... and what is your distinction with Coleman v. Miller?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,362.268,364.753,"--That's one of four distinctions, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.328,377.245,--They're not standing questions?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,377.245,382.465,"Well, in addition there's the different kind of standing involved there."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.54,452.978,You think... then the... what controls when a bill is printed up as a public act?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,452.978,456.613,"This is a statutory matter, Justice White."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.613,465.203,And so I take it that Congress couldn't ever insist that their public laws be... that the public laws be printed?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,465.203,466.571,"Well, presumably--"
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.571,467.005,By a suit?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,467.005,468.271,--By a suit.
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.023,478.094,"You say, no, the executive would just say, I know I'm supposed to get these public acts printed up, but it costs too much money."
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,478.094,481.546,"Presumably if Congress wanted to hire its own printer, that would be another matter."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.546,486.95,"Well, what about a joint resolution by Congress saying, we want to sue?"
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,486.95,491.751,It's our position that would not be effective in creating standing.
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.751,496.305,So it just isn't an individual Congressman or a Senator or one House.
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,501.607,504.744,"In this kind of a situation, over execution of the laws."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.023,525.575,That may be so.
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,530.442,533.061,"I understand, Justice White."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.844,559.546,So we just leave these cases to political settlement?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,559.546,561.896,"--No, Justice White, not at all."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.52,576.306,"Yes, but Congress can't do anything about it?"
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,576.306,579.358,"Not by filing a lawsuit, Justice White."
1986.85-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.358,591.165,"Well, Mr. Willard, certainly Coleman v. Miller may have a bearing on that insofar as the Senate, as a body, or the House, as a body, is concerned."
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,603.306,605.491,"There certainly could be, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.514,617.816,But not much stronger?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,617.816,620.085,But we have decided it's still not strong enough.
1986.85-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,624.904,626.354,"Well, what about Coleman?"
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,626.354,638.629,"--Well, as I indicated to Justice Stevens, I think Coleman dealt with a different kind of question, one that involved a State rather than the federal Congress, and that the separation of powers are different."
1986.85-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,639.498,642.533,"Just let me get this thought up, then I want you to complete your answer."
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,659.46,661.844,"--Well, it's unclear, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,669.35,671.483,"Well, let's confine ourselves to the five, counting Chief Justice Hughes."
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,671.483,683.341,"Well, and what they said in Coleman was, they said that State senators have an interest in the controversy which, treated by the State court, is a basis for entertaining and deciding the Federal questions, is sufficient to give this Court jurisdiction to review that decision."
1986.85-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.543,686.812,But you're not suggesting the State court can create injury in fact?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,686.812,690.347,--That is what the Coleman majority suggested.
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,691.047,691.681,Was held.
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,698.62,700.453,--Sufficient.
1986.85-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.716,738.844,"Yet in our Doremus case in the early fifties we said, apparently contrary to your view of Coleman v. Miller, that the same standards govern adjudication of Federal questions raised in State courts as govern Federal questions adjudicated in Federal courts."
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,738.844,744.396,"I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, and that may case some doubt on the Coleman decision itself--"
1986.85-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.396,745.364,I would think it would.
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,745.364,749.283,--as to whether it's correct or not in this case.
1986.85-781,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,785.991,791.979,"Mr. Willard, if we grant you relief, how do we explain that we are not legislating?"
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,797.799,811.107,"No, Justice Marshall, actually what we're asking you to do is to simply vacate the Court of Appeals' decision as moot, or to find that there is no standing here, and not to reach the merits of this case."
1986.85-781,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.107,813.143,You don't want us to reach the merits?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,813.143,815.428,"No, we don't, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-781,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,831.37,831.87,0 xxx.
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,831.87,835.322,--We do believe it is moot.
1986.85-781,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,835.322,837.091,And that's all you want decided?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,837.091,839.793,"Well, we think that would be sufficient to dispose of the case."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.32,884.172,"Well, why would it... why would it be a jurisdictional question?"
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,891.742,894.944,"--Well, we do suggest that there would be a lack of a cause of action."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,898.146,900.181,But why is it a jurisdictional question at all?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,909.053,910.905,--Not by bringing a lawsuit.
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.905,911.755,Well--
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,911.755,912.855,This Court in--
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.855,918.143,--But all you're saying is that you really... there is just not cause of action.
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,920.511,929.367,"--We think... we think that there is no cause of action under the bill publication statutes, because one was not intended among other things."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.919,935.271,But is that a jurisdictional question?
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,935.271,937.39,"Well, it can be jurisdictional."
1986.85-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.39,937.84,You say it is.
1986.85-781,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,943.46,947.745,"Well, Justice White, we're happy to win however we do."
1986.85-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1253.994,1256.012,"Thank you, Mr. Willard."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1257.963,1261.249,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-781,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1362.698,1376.625,"Mr. Frankel, would you think that an individual Member of Congress would always have standing to sue a member of the executive branch to get that Member to enforce some law that Congress has passed?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1376.625,1389.598,"--Not generally to enforce laws that Congress has passed, but to enforce the very particular statute that requires the executive to record the enactment of laws."
1986.85-781,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1396.202,1399.904,"Well, you... you think that a Member would lack standing to do that?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1399.904,1400.82,"--To do that, yes."
1986.85-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.625,1434.408,"Well, they didn't... did they say that in so many words?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1438.112,1439.062,"Yes, they did."
1986.85-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1459.192,1463.744,"There was a dispute over the actual counting of the votes, wasn't there, in the Kansas legislature?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1463.744,1469.048,One of the issues... there were several issues... one is whether the Lieutenant Governor should be permitted to break the tie vote.
1986.85-781,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1521.516,1526.42,"Well, I guess only three members of the Court joined the discussion of the opinion on standing."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1526.42,1531.955,There had to be... the Court had to have found that there was jurisdiction to go on and reach the justiciability.
1986.85-781,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1531.955,1535.692,"But only three people joined the part that discussed standing, didn't they?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1535.692,1543.263,It's unclear... there must have been five on the standing issue in order to have gone on and decided the others.
1986.85-781,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.263,1549.816,"I guess the dissenters must have implicitly though there was standing, but they did not join the Court's opinion on it."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1549.816,1551.135,That's correct.
1986.85-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.135,1561.574,"I wonder how consistent that ruling is with later cases from this Court, like Schlesinger v. Reservists and United States v. Richardson?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1567.997,1569.563,"Well, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1986.85-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1590.01,1591.843,"Well, I wonder if there has."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1603.151,1609.472,--But whether those votes were successful in enacting a law is--
1986.85-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.472,1611.256,"Well, that's not the same thing, I don't think."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1611.256,1616.041,"--Well, there was not question was the vote count was in the Coleman case."
1986.85-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.779,1624.914,"Well, but one of the questions was whether the Lieutenant Governor could break a tie, which was a question about the vote count."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1624.914,1625.433,That's right.
1986.85-781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1653.016,1657.135,"In this case, were these votes recorded in the Congressional Record?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1657.135,1658.735,They were recorded in each House.
1986.85-781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1670.026,1681.25,"But you say it didn't have their votes, that their complaint was that it wasn't fair to their vote."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1683.868,1687.654,"It was published, but the bill hasn't been published."
1986.85-781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.391,1698.176,"Well, wasn't it recorded in the Congressional Record?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1698.176,1699.209,"--The votes were, but--"
1986.85-781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1699.209,1701.145,"You use the word, record."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1704.013,1704.947,--The votes were recorded.
1986.85-781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1704.947,1707.615,Wasn't it also recorded in The New York Times--
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1707.615,1709.567,It was publicly known.
1986.85-781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1709.567,1710.234,--and all around the world.
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1713.953,1715.405,But that's where Congress--
1986.85-781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1715.405,1716.588,--and that wrecks everybody.
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1716.588,1733.516,"--It's been... it's been understood since the very first Congress, and the statute they passed in 1789, that the completion of the lawmaking process includes the requirement that the executive branch record laws that have been enacted."
1986.85-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.172,1953.993,But hasn't the controversy somewhat been dispelled by the fact that the law expired?
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1959.314,1976.674,"--Yes, Congress publishes... the executive publishes by statute all laws that have become law, and that includes... if it's a two-day continuing resolution to keep the government funded for the first couple of days of the fiscal year, that's expired before it's ever published, but it's published."
1986.85-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1977.442,1985.446,But what do Members of Congress gain in the sense that would give them standing by having a law that is expired published?
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,1985.446,1989.081,--The basis for our standing was only the infringement to our vote.
1986.85-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.727,2014.263,"Yes, but Mr. Frankel, they did sue to enforce the publishing law."
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,2014.263,2014.829,That's right.
1986.85-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.965,2018.25,Isn't there a question whether they have standing to do that?
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,2018.25,2019.167,--There is a question.
1986.85-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.225,2039.081,"Supposing there was a misprint in the statutes at large, and there are sometimes, could Congress sue the President and say, I want you reprint the volume?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,2039.081,2043.799,"Well, that would be a... that would be a more difficult case."
1986.85-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.382,2044.715,Why?
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,2051.886,2054.321,"--Well, there might be other barriers."
1986.85-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.677,2064.094,That strengthens my case.
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,2066.212,2067.128,Shouldn't be.
1986.85-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.128,2067.277,No.
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,2067.277,2070.83,But it might be that there's a point at which it's gone too far.
1986.85-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.113,2128.968,"Well, but again, respond to your opponent's argument on that: Does Congress have standing to enforce these accounting requirements?"
1986.85-781,1,35787,morgan_j_frankel,,2128.968,2131.035,"Well, we haven't asserted it."
1986.85-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.878,2151.699,"Is it not true that this record does not tell us whether there has even been a violation of the terms of the bill, whether it was a law or not?"
