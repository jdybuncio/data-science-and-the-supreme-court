1968.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,59.959,"Number 38, James G. Glover et al, petitioners, versus St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Co. et al."
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,62.085,68.097,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.722,488.865,"Well, don't you allege a conspiracy, so to speak, between the Union and the employer here in your complaint?"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,488.865,489.661,"Yes, we do, which would --"
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,489.661,491.577,"I don't believe you use the word ""conspiracy,"" but --"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,491.577,492.146,I don't know that that word is used.
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,492.146,493.014,A short action by these --
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,493.014,494.332,"I don't think it is, but that's --"
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,494.332,500.164,"Short action by these co-dependants in depriving your clients of promotion and the pay that goes with promotions, isn't that right?"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,500.164,501.302,Exactly.
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,501.302,505.015,"Well, then why couldn't they get damages from the Union if you're right?"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,505.015,517.524,"I don't think they could get damages from the Union in -- within the Union constitutional procedures but, then, we're discussing constitutional procedures within the Union, assuming they exist, that are not pledged."
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.316,820.322,"But, I take it, that there's no question that the individual employee, as distinguished from the Union, may oper -- may energize the grievance procedure in the railroad business."
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,820.322,826.633,"Mr. Justice White, you are certainly correct because I have, on behalf of an individual, invoked the NRAB procedures."
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.633,828.071,The statutes permits or it doesn't?
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,828.071,829.861,It does permit it.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.861,838.005,"And, doesn't the statute require the grievance procedure?"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,838.005,842.706,You mean the grievance procedure within the company before the NRAB or --
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.706,845.724,"Under the -- yes, under the --"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,845.724,846.197,I think --
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,846.197,854.73,Let's assume that a collective bargaining contract between a Union and the railroad doesn't say anything about grievances.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,863.976,865.886,"I think it does, Your Honor."
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.886,867.623,And wholly independent of the contract.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,867.623,868.635,By its terms.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.635,869.767,Wholly independent of the contract.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,869.767,871.647,Wholly independent of the contract.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.647,873.054,"Well, how do you get around that?"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,873.054,879.641,"Of course, I don't think the contract here, which we don't have before us, says anything about the National Railroad Adjustment Board."
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.641,880.12,"Well, I know."
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,880.809,883.198,"Yes, sir."
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.198,895.294,"So you're just saying that when that -- you're just saying that when the -- if you claim racial discrimination, the statutory requirement to take that sort of a claim to the Board is --"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,895.294,907.1,"Under the Steel, Tungsten, Conley rationale, we say that does control to avoid the exclusive jurisdiction."
1968.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,912.274,913.915,"Do you mean in both cases then, that you may --"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,913.915,914.268,Those cases --
1968.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,914.268,916.813,Bypass -- that may bypass the Board?
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,916.813,930.855,"As I interpret them and as I hope to demonstrate, do say that in this context, particularly where you're suing the Union, and this Court in several cases has said that a remedy can be --"
1968.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,930.855,935.196,I -- perhaps I better put it this way.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,947.676,981.183,"Well, my own personal view, Mr. Justice Brennan, would be that this particular tribunal as constituted with an absence of judicial review from an adverse decision to an employee, if the Congress required it and attempted to overrule by legislation the Steel and Tungsten cases, as I interpret them, then I think the Congress would've enacted unconstitutional legislation, that's my personal view."
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.459,1183.178,"In the Maddox case, as I remember it, the only reason it could be asserted that he was wrongfully discharged was because of rights that were conferred to him by the collective bargaining agreement itself."
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1185.956,1186.196,Well --
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1186.196,1202.657,"And, therefore, the Court held that if he's going to rely on the rights which are conferred upon him as the beneficiary of the collective bargaining contract, he had to go through the other provisions provided by that contract."
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1207.148,1208.795,I would have to say that we are.
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1208.795,1210.765,You are?
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1210.765,1215.436,We're very -- we admit to being --
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1215.436,1215.879,That is the seniority rights?
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1215.879,1225.574,For asking the Court for a decision which very definitely will involve and will admit an interpretation application of --
1968.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1225.574,1225.748,The collective bargaining agreement.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1225.748,1229.275,Of the collective bargaining agreement.
1968.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1229.275,1232.862,May I ask you when this case was begun?
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1232.862,1239.802,"It was filed in June or July of 1965, Mr. Justice Black."
1968.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1252.766,1258.163,I notice that Mr. Cooper's firm had something to do with it at one time.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1258.163,1268.127,"Mr. Cooper's firm is counsel for the carmen, locally there and did participate in the lower levels of the Court."
1968.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1268.127,1272.528,"Well, was that begun while my son was there with you?"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1272.528,1276.091,"No, Your Honor, it was not."
1968.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1277.947,1279.145,No question about that?
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1279.145,1285.128,"No, sir, no question whatsoever."
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1285.128,1296.775,What's the basis for your claim that you don't really have a remedy before the Board?
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1305.512,1306.105,That's right.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.249,1314.177,"That's what the Court said in Steel, wasn't it?"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1314.177,1315.914,In Steel and in Conley.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.914,1315.968,But --
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1315.968,1317.309,It simply said that there was no --
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1317.309,1317.609,But that doesn't go for--
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1317.609,1318.741,No mechanical --
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.741,1322.388,But that doesn't go for a suit against the employer.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1322.388,1322.951,That's true.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.951,1325.37,Based on the collective bargaining contract that he signed.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1325.37,1325.849,That's true.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.424,1361.867,"Well, I'm just suggestion that Steel and Tungsten didn't hold that it-- that the employee may go to Court on a breach of a collective bargaining contract in a suit against the employer."
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1361.867,1363.574,"Well, I don't know whether Mr. --"
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.574,1371.838,They may be able -- those cases may get you into Court on a claim for breach of fair representation duty against the Union.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1371.838,1393.509,"Of course, I don't know -- I can't remember whether Mr. Justice White was on the Court when Conley against Gibson was decided, but the respondents here had never answered and never attempted an answer as to the significance of footnote 4 in Conley against Gibson."
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.635,1424.42,Let's get Steel and Tungsten there first.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1430.761,1433.666,"I think they would, based on their language."
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.241,1438.415,But they said there wasn't --
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1438.415,1439.756,The Union being present.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.756,1442.301,They said there wasn't any remedy.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1449.277,1451.613,That's one thing they said.
1968.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.613,1454.329,"Yes, well, that's kind of critical, isn't it?"
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1454.329,1480.22,"I think it is one critical point of those decisions, but I do think that they're both not just susceptible by a sweeping argument to conclude from it that, in cases where invidious discrimination such as racial discrimination is involved and the doors of the Court are open."
1968.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1625.701,1627.268,In which case?
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1627.268,1631.012,That's Vaca against Sipes.
1968.38,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1637.901,1641.833,386 U.S.
1968.38,0,45583,william_macker_jr,,1641.833,1654.317,"The Preemption Doctrine, however, has never been rigidly applied to cases where it could not be fairly be inferred that Congress intended exclusive jurisdiction to lie with the NLRB."
1968.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1804.196,1807.305,You may.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,1815.434,1820.636,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1885.295,1891.978,"Is -- under Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act, can the Union be made a defendant?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,1891.978,1895.608,"The Union was made a defendant in that proceeding, sir."
1968.38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1895.608,1896.781,In addition to the employer?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,1896.781,1902.285,"Yes, sir."
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.21,2104.02,Mr. Fisher.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2104.02,2104.262,"Yes, sir?"
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2104.262,2109.676,Do the Railway Adjustment Board still divide it equally between Brotherhood and railroad?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2109.676,2110.305,"Yes, sir."
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.537,2122.39,"And, in this case, don't -- they're not alleged that there has been cooperation between the Brotherhood and the railroads?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2122.39,2130.368,"Not at the level, Mr. Justice, as which the selections to the National Railroad Adjustment Board made."
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.453,2137.282,"But they do allege that they are working together against their best interest, do they not?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2137.282,2138.909,"Yes, the allegation is made --"
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2138.909,2141.026,"Then, I have three short questions."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2141.026,2142.32,"Yes, sir."
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2142.32,2155.832,"If Congress adopted an Act which said ""you and I have a dispute, you shall be the sole arbiter as to which one is right,"" would that be due process?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2155.832,2157.459,"I would not believe it would be, sir."
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2157.459,2173.088,"Well, if Congress passed an Act and said that ""if I had a dispute with you and somebody else, that the two of you would be the final arbiters as to which side was right,"" would that be due process?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2173.088,2177.171,The two of us?
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2177.171,2177.709,That wouldn't be --
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2177.709,2179.463,That is not as clear as the first answer.
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2181.822,2184.514,What's different between that and this situation?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2184.514,2199.78,"The difference between that and this situation is that, at the highest level, that carrier group and the Union groups appoint individuals who are designated by federal statute to act as arbitrators."
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.206,2270.589,"Well, how do you get around Steel or worse?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2297.614,2298.515,"Well, Steel --"
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.515,2300.844,Has that case ever been modified that you know of?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2300.844,2301.896,"Steel, no, sir."
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.296,2340.286,You mean the Court just wasted its time talking about this remedy?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2340.286,2340.794,No.
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.794,2343.425,"In those terms, they did."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2343.425,2344.786,"No, sir, Mr. Justice White."
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.026,2351.917,"Well, they took it seriously."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2351.917,2377.255,"The Court in the Steel case, I believe, said that this was not a matter that was to be heard before the Adjustment Board because the hostile discrimination against these individuals engaged in by the Union could not be remedied before the Adjustment Board, and that was the suit which established, as I understand it, the so-called civil action for a breach of the duty of fair representation."
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2491.702,2499.377,"In the Union constitution, you get to -- you don't want to talk anymore on the National --"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2499.377,2543.667,"No, what I say, Mr. Justice, about the National Railroad Adjustment Board is simply this, that for a vindication of their rights of seniority, their contract rights, as railroad employees, their rights under the contract and customs and practices, that that is a matter solely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the National Railroad Adjustment Board and that this has been held many, many times and that there are no exceptions to that rule, except in the one instance when an employee accepts a discharge as final, the Moore versus Illinois Central exception, and then attempts to sue the carrier for damages only."
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2543.667,2551.53,[Inaudible 42:22-42:31]
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2551.53,2552.8,Pardon?
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2552.8,2556.248,[Inaudible]
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2556.248,2562.563,I do not believe that that means --
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2562.563,2566.065,What did Hayes hold?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2566.065,2570.783,I must say that I am unable to give a description of the Hayes case.
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2574.829,2575.192,Well --
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2575.192,2576.462,State exactly what Hayes held.
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2576.462,2591.462,"Well, Hayes was a suit who was charged with discrimination against Negro employees, such as here, in the enforcement of the department employee right."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2607.915,2608.248,I --
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2608.248,2612.784,"In this Court, footnote 4, we disapproved that motion."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2612.784,2613.51,Yes.
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2613.51,2613.813,In the Conley case.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2613.813,2616.317,Yes.
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.635,2698.698,"Hayes actually was a suit against the railroad charged with stipulation by the railroad against the Union members for making the seniority assignments proposal, precisely the same with what we have here."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2698.698,2700.144,"Well, if the agreement --"
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2700.144,2709.029,"Here, we have the facts that this allegation is made in this case as collusive arrangement between the railroads and the Union."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2709.029,2711.025,Only-- not as to the agreement.
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2711.025,2718.827,"It would be only against the railroad but not against the -- also against the Union, is that it?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2718.827,2727.74,"Well, Mr. Justice Brennan, again, I am sorry that I can't discuss the Hayes case in the detail that I should be --"
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2727.74,2733.788,"Well, it's only two-paragraphs long and I've given you about all of it."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2733.788,2734.998,In the present --
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2734.998,2744.676,Do you think the significance of footnote 4 only goes to the actions there involved of the company will breach fair representation?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2744.676,2744.972,Yes.
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2744.972,2745.668,Do you?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2745.668,2756.428,"Yes, I think Conley was limited to a claim that the Union failed to accord these Negro members of the Clerk Craft, on that carrier, their rights of fair representation."
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2761.297,2779.47,"Well, I have a difficulty seeing why Hayes bore law on an act where breach of the obligation to afford the miracle only access to the river."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2779.47,2781.073,"Well, I --"
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2781.073,2786.426,What should've been obviously reversed and --
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2786.426,2790.751,I would think it may well had been if the contract was clearly discriminatory.
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2790.751,2818.012,"They recovered at Tungsten, clearly, the plain application as to what was said or had not -- you just can't take a forming kind and force the contract, but if you also allege that breach of the duty of fair representation and racial discrimination, that you'll tell the Court in an appeal."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2818.012,2843.785,"Yes, but Conley versus Gibson has indicated that the breach of the duty that we're talking about, I think, in part of this case, a fair representation is a breach of duty on the part of the Union, a breach of contract when you say interpretation of contracts."
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2851.195,2869.758,"Well, Tungsten and Steel went on to say the remedy against the employer before the Adjustment Board is not immensely straight into the act because it will make them proper tribunal, both of them."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2869.758,2884.691,I am not aware that the Supreme Court in those cases held that the Board was not a fair tribunal or a proper tribunal to bring a contract claim.
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2903.87,2908.044,"Well, I-- but, as I re-pace again, I know you haven't seen it yet, but --"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2908.044,2909.822,"I have seen the case, but I -- that's --"
1968.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2909.822,2927.514,"Well, as I have done, and maybe quite well about it in the brief opinion, in any event, that was an action charging the railroad discriminatory application in matters of seniority, which stand the seniority question for you."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,2959.77,2974.252,"No, but I -- again, the only explanation I can give is that the Conley versus Gibson case dealt with the duty of the railroad to press the grievance when they were asked to press the grievance."
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.347,3072.986,What expertise does the Railroad Adjustment Board have to find out whether a man is being discriminated against because of his raise?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3072.986,3078.611,"That is the issue which I think is justiciable in the Courts, Mr. Justice."
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3111.666,3122.16,"Well, is there anything in the procedure that will give him compensation for what has been done to him in the past?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3123.612,3124.241,Pardon me?
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3124.241,3131.802,"There's no procedure, even machinery or internal Union Brotherhood machinery, that will give him damages."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3134.276,3135.207,Not damages.
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3138.746,3140.706,Well --
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3140.706,3140.73,Justice Marshall --
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3140.73,3144.299,I for one have difficult in jumping from the Union to the Adjustment Board.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3144.747,3146.616,There is no jump from the Union to the Adjustment Board.
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3151.418,3152.326,That's what I thought.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3152.326,3154.014,That is our po -- we concede that.
1968.38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3154.014,3155.036,"Well, alright."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3176.931,3204.594,"Well, but we say, yes, but we say also, before -- as a member of an association, before they attempt to sue the association for a possible act of misp -- on the part of a local agent, that it is neat and proper, and is so recognized under federal law as neat and proper, to attempt to get this matter resolved internally and within the organization."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3244.256,3256.093,"Would you say that if they had pursued those remedies and stopped there, that they'd be properly here?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3256.093,3267.004,"I -- yes, if they had attempted, if they had made a fair bonafied reasonable attempt, which they did not make and which they concede they didn't make, and had found that they were getting no relief."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3274.02,3277.256,Without going to the Board?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3277.256,3283.487,"Well, the remedy I'm talking about is the remedy against the Union, the remedy that they sought in Conley versus Gibson."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3283.487,3287.51,"No, I asked you if they'd be properly here in this case."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3287.51,3289.681,"Well, conceivably, in the claim against the Union."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3289.681,3293.371,"For what their asking for, would they be properly here?"
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3297.871,3304.645,Not in respect to their claim for an interpretation or application of the language of the collective bargaining agreement.
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3328.841,3344.228,"And, your answer would be that even though they had gone through all the grievance procedures that if they wanted the relief they're asking in this case, they must also have gone to the Adjustment Board."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3344.228,3348.401,"Yes, the relief under the contract is available before the Adjustment Board."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3413.016,3417.794,How long would it take them normally to go through the grievance procedure?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3417.794,3418.671,"Not very long, and --"
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3418.671,3421.544,How long?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3421.544,3425.657,"I would say the grievance procedure on the property, if you're talking about the railroad property --"
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3425.657,3429.468,I'm talking about the grievance that they had in this case.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3429.468,3430.702,"Well, the grievance is two-fold."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3431.24,3432.238,"Well, both of them."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3432.238,3432.39,Both of --
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3432.39,3432.807,Let's take both of them together.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3432.807,3439.309,"Alright, both of them together, I believe that they could have processed the grievances fully in less than two years."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3439.309,3440.065,Less than two years?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3440.065,3440.61,"Less than two years, yes, sir."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3440.61,3441.39,Alright.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3448.89,3453.82,"No, I was assuming that the Arbitration Board decision would also be handed down, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3469.812,3477.639,"I thought counsel said something about three years before the Board, that there's a concession to that effect."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3477.639,3495.778,"No, I said less than three years, but my co-counsel of the carrier pointed out a report which I then read and the case -- the backlog is less than a year on the second division, and I am of the opinion --"
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3495.778,3497.714,You concede three years.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3497.714,3499.492,I said less than three years.
1968.38,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3507.531,3510.852,Through the Courts?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3510.852,3511.723,"Through the Courts, Mr. Justice Black?"
1968.38,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3511.723,3513.108,Yes.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3513.108,3513.652,Well --
1968.38,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3513.652,3515.769,After the Board through the Court?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3515.769,3521.757,"Well, now, a decision of the Board, of course, is final and binding, except for certain limited grounds of review."
1968.38,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3525.991,3527.14,If they were available.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3527.14,3531.586,"If they were available, I would hesitate to say what the state had adopted in Birmingham, Alabama, as in the Courts."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3541.651,3545.002,"Mr. Fisher, you may continue with your argument."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3545.002,3550.772,"Thank you, sir."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3674.768,3677.49,"You may finish that statement, if you wish."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3677.49,3678.246,"Yes, sir."
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3711.219,3718.562,Why do you -- why does the Court say the administrative remedy was inadequate in Steel and Tungsten?
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3723.697,3723.969,Well --
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.969,3731.197,"In both sides, both parties who were accused of discriminating against the plaintiff were sitting there deciding the dispute."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3732.074,3733.556,I think that's -- they had a however.
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3737.875,3749.3,"The Union was -- the Union who was sitting on one side of that tribunal was so biased and so unreliable, and it's not the attorneys that used the administrative action."
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3761.397,3765.087,"Well, may I answer the question this way, Mr. Justice White."
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3773.942,3774.934,It hasn't come to be --
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3774.934,3775.14,"Yes, alright."
1968.38,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3775.14,3776.555,That's the --
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3776.555,3777.251,"Yes, sir."
1968.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3853.229,3854.07,Thank you.
1968.38,1,21696,donald_wfisher,,3854.07,3856.816,Thank you.
1968.38,2,45583,william_macker_jr,,3856.816,3859.108,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3859.108,3860.983,Mr. Acker.
1968.38,2,45583,william_macker_jr,,3860.983,3863.372,Just a couple of remarks.
1968.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3961.757,3963.572,"Very well, you make it very brief."
1968.38,2,45583,william_macker_jr,,3963.784,3980.865,"One other thing, the remark was made and was made in briefs that Mr. Dent has availed himself of the remedy provided him or attempted to, he's been unsuccessful thus far, the remedy provided by the Civil Rights Act in 1964, in which I'm not involved."
