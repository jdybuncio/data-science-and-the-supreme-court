1984.84-312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.138,We will hear arguments next in Devine against NAACP Legal Defense Educational Fund.
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,84.236,97.685,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Combined Federal Campaign is an annual effort by the federal government to solicit contributions to charity from its employees."
1984.84-312,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.832,201.242,Was that decision ever appealed?
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,201.242,202.213,--It was not.
1984.84-312,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.213,205.205,Is there any indication in the record why it wasn't appealed?
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,205.205,206.726,"No, there is not."
1984.84-312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,329.387,333.039,"Mr. Lee, does your case stand or fall on that proposition?"
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,333.039,335.461,"No, it does not, Justice Blackmun."
1984.84-312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,522.313,528.237,"Mr. Lee, some of your listed groups, however, go off on opposite directions, don't they?"
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,528.237,529.677,That is correct.
1984.84-312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,529.677,531.788,How does that square with what you have just said?
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,531.788,533.671,"Well, I think it squares completely."
1984.84-312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,564.829,573.084,"Specifically, I refer to the Moral Majority Foundation on the one hand and Planned Parenthood Foundation on the other hand."
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,573.084,575.328,"I misunderstood your question, Justice Blackmun."
1984.84-312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,613.633,615.453,"But your answer is, they just made a mistake?"
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,615.453,616.855,"--Well, that they might have."
1984.84-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.892,631.656,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you a question about the record?"
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,648.805,653.328,"Well, we think what is needed here is a total reversal."
1984.84-312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.59,655.778,You think the record is adequate?
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,655.778,656.569,--We think it is.
1984.84-312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1171.957,1178.589,"That would force or at least bring some pressure to include churches as such, would it not?"
1984.84-312,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1178.589,1182.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, my answer to that is yes."
1984.84-312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1248.486,1252.978,Very well.
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1253.739,1265.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is also respondent's position that the issue presented by this case is a narrow and specific one."
1984.84-312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1557.518,1559.791,Mr. Ralston--
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1559.791,1560.459,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1560.459,1561.08,--I am curious.
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1567.875,1574.839,"Yes, Your Honor, in recent campaigns there has been approximately 60 to 65 percent."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1686.911,1691.035,"How about the District of Columbia Bar Association, for example?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1691.035,1703.804,"Your Honor, if they are charitable activities, such as to qualify them generally, if they qualified as a 501(c)(3) organization and met the other various provisions that are in the regulations, they might be able to qualify."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1705.855,1707.347,How about the ACLU?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1707.347,1719.564,"The ACLU Foundation, which is their tax-exempt arm of the ACLU, would be able to come in in the same way that the NAACP Special Contribution Fund is in the campaign."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1719.564,1724.577,"When the designations are made, is that controlling?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1724.577,1727.269,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.269,1730.041,What about the undesignated funds?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1731.932,1745.422,"Under the present system, or the system that existed that is in issue here, the undesignated money goes to a private organization which has been designated the principal combined fundraising organization."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1759.21,1765.544,"Does that take into account the amount that was received, allocated by the designation?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1765.544,1769.965,Not under the formulas as I understand them.
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.969,1791.351,Why not?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1791.351,1810.063,"Because the District Court held that the rule that we are challenging was only unconstitutional as it related to getting designated funds, and essentially said, if we felt we were being wrongfully denied undesignated funds, we could challenge that under the equal protection claim."
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.309,1838.804,The cases were judged that you may constitutionally be kept from sharing the undesignated funds?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1838.804,1839.195,--Yes.
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.788,1848.949,I am curious why you didn't.
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1848.949,1851.881,"Well, basically, Your Honor, the formula--"
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.881,1853.513,Maybe you thought you would lose.
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1854.282,1862.009,"--We thought we might lose, and quite frankly, it began to become de minimis, because when we first challenged it, 65 percent of the funds were undesignated."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1981.455,1982.486,May I ask this?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1982.486,1983.398,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1983.398,1998.428,"Who does the weighing, and on what standards would they do the weighing to decide whether the presence of certain organizations would lead some employees to boycott the entire enterprise?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,1998.428,2005.501,"Your Honor, that is basically the government's controversy argument, and our first position would be--"
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2005.501,2008.883,"That is a little more than... it is broader than controversy, isn't it?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2008.883,2009.534,--Yes.
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.806,2016.728,"I was thinking of Planned Parenthood, for example."
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2022.334,2043.926,"Yes, and as the Planned Parenthood amicus brief establishes, it provides health services of exactly the kind that other organizations are in, and in fact the record in that case establishes that the petitioner attempted to keep him out because he didn't like them along with other organizations didn't like them."
1984.84-312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2369.65,2379.728,"Well, isn't it true that from '61 until the first court action in this case that traditional charities were the only ones in the Federal Combined Campaign?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2379.728,2385.932,"Well, Your Honor, I don't understand quite what traditional means."
1984.84-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.751,2479.973,"Mr. Ralston, can I interrupt you?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2479.973,2480.784,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.784,2491.921,"You referred us to the Planned Parenthood amicus brief which I looked at during your argument, and their first argument is that the Executive Order is an attempt to suppress ideas with which the petitioner disagrees."
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2493.972,2516.716,"Your Honor, we... well, we have not relied in our brief on a viewpoint argument, although the government has always taken the position that it wants us out because it doesn't want federal employees to read our 30 words and perhaps give us their money, so in a way that is an attempt to express the expression of our views, our ideas as to how their money should be spent."
1984.84-312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.716,2523.401,"If you don't make that argument, and I understand you make it marginally, I guess, what is the standard?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2536.761,2552.088,"There are... well, to begin with, I will answer your question, but my first point would be, and I would like to reemphasize it, assuming a line needs to be drawn, the line they have drawn here is an unconstitutional one."
1984.84-312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2697.174,2706.423,Do you think the government allowing churches to solicit as a part of a general charitable campaign could be construed as the government supporting religion?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2706.423,2707.482,"--Your Honor, I don't say that."
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.87,2777.577,"Well, I suppose the exclusion was for some reason."
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2782.82,2799.683,"Yes, the reason given in the District Court, and this was the main defense of the government in the District Court, was the controversy, that they got all these letters from people complaining about the fact legal defense funds or these political organizations--"
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2799.683,2805.797,"Well, do you accept that as the reason, that that was really the active reason?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2805.797,2810.899,"--That is what the District Court so found, and we believe that is the only reason that makes any sense to us."
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.379,2814.773,"And you say that... and your position is, that is just inadequate?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2814.773,2818.246,"That it is not only inadequate, it is an unconstitutional reason."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2838.717,2839.488,How about the Socialist Party?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2839.488,2840.48,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.48,2842.64,How about the Socialist Party of America?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2842.64,2847.893,"Your Honor, they are not a charitable organization, and that simply is not at issue."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.135,2854.678,It certainly would involve the First Amendment points that you were making.
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2854.678,2856.1,"--That is true, Your Honor, but--"
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2856.1,2866.205,"If this is a forum and the First Amendment applies, I have difficulty seeing how the Socialist Party could be excluded."
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2866.205,2886.618,"--Your Honor we do not contend that the government, having opened up with, we contend, which we urge first is a limited public forum, a forum for the specific purpose of charitable solicitation, then as required to under the decisions of this Court, open it up to any type of solicitation."
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.528,2997.863,"Well, you would... I take it if your argument is sound it wouldn't make any difference how much controversy had been... would be engendered, and even if half or three-quarters of the people who had been participating would no longer participate, you would still be entitled to be in."
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,2997.863,2999.253,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.253,3006.297,For your argument it is just irrelevant how much controversy there is.
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,3006.297,3006.986,That is right.
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.458,3027.152,"But all of this depends upon whether this is or is not a public forum, does it not?"
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,3027.152,3038.258,"Your Honor, our basic position is that even assuming it is a nonpublic forum in the Perry analysis, the reasons given are unreasonable and indeed are unconstitutional reasons."
1984.84-312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.246,3070.649,Your position you don't think is inconsistent with Shaker Heights?
1984.84-312,1,19940,charles_stephen_ralston,,3070.649,3071.721,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3084.138,3087.039,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3087.039,3088.671,"Just two matters, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-312,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.266,3112.848,You said that was the only--
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3112.848,3113.857,--The only one he thought was any good.
1984.84-312,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.857,3115.53,--testimony before the District Court.
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3117.33,3128.856,"Well, whether that is true or not, certainly the President is entitled to make some reasonable judgments."
1984.84-312,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.856,3138.343,"How do we know what the reasons were for his actions, excluding?"
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3141.996,3143.656,"Well, the reasons are really set forth--"
1984.84-312,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.656,3146.628,"--It may be that there are a lot of reasons he might have had, but what were they?"
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3146.628,3152.102,--The reasons are set forth in the content of the executive order themselves.
1984.84-312,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.416,3177.029,So we are to find the reasons in the Executive Order?
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3178.449,3202.124,"--Well, the basis, at least, for those judgments, but the point is that there has to be a certain amount of leeway for... there is no way that anyone can determine for sure whether the President was right or wrong in determining that the contribution to the government's net welfare benefit will be positive or negative."
1984.84-312,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3207.049,3210.23,"Now, is that the reason stated in the executive order?"
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3210.23,3210.889,"--Yes, it is."
1984.84-312,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3289.433,3299.878,I suppose the application of those criteria might lead to striking some of the other people who are now on the approved list.
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3299.878,3304.562,"Of course, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is the final point that I want to make."
1984.84-312,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3461.785,3462.196,Mr. Lee?
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3462.196,3462.657,Yes.
1984.84-312,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3462.657,3472.464,"What about his suggestion that you could limit it to organizations that solicit funds, their principal source of funds are derived from general public solicitations, which I suppose would take churches out of it?"
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3476.345,3478.308,Of course it would be a reasonable ground.
1984.84-312,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3478.308,3481.25,"--So you could draw a line that would exclude churches, I take it."
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3481.25,3498.52,"Sure, if you adopt the kind of standard that we are proposing, that is, a standard that is truly a reasonableness standard, and gives a certain amount of deference in drawing those kinds of lines, but if you turn it around the other way, and then you ask yourself the question, but do you have to do it that way--"
1984.84-312,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3498.52,3503.743,"Well, I guess you would agree you at least have to say that your reason has to be a constitutionally permissible reason."
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3503.743,3504.174,--That is correct.
1984.84-312,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3504.174,3510.649,"And neutral, so that if, for example, controversy is not a constitutionally permissible reason, then you'd be in some trouble."
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3510.649,3512.242,"That is correct, but it is not just--"
1984.84-312,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3512.242,3514.022,As suggested by Perry.
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3514.022,3527.24,"--That is correct, but we still have the other two, and I turn back to Perry and to Lehman, and the reason that Perry and Lehman are good law, Justice Stevens, is not that it gives a Hecklers veto, right to veto."
1984.84-312,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3556.37,3559.843,"Well, you don't claim that controversy causes that sort of harm."
1984.84-312,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3564.284,3583.147,"--Well, it might chill the total contributions, and it might increase, or a person could certainly conclude that it might increase the amount of time and effort of federal employees in conducting the campaign, and as I say, that is one of the three reasons."
1984.84-312,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3586.071,3586.59,"Thank you, gentlemen."
