2001.00-9280,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,9.163,21.291,Mr. Bruck.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,21.291,37.75,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For the second time this year, the Court considers today South Carolina's compliance with your decision in Simmons v. South Carolina."
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,64.043,79.163,"Well, in... in some sense... and this is what concerns me about your argument... I... I suppose at some level future dangerousness is... is always inferable from the fact of... of a horrible crime."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,79.163,95.638,"I... I think it is true that... that when a person is convicted beyond a reasonable doubt of an aggravated, death-eligible murder, it is... it does not take very much more to put the issue of future dangerousness at issue."
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.211,126.112,We... we are the ones that... that gave you this... this category of future dangerousness.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,150.715,161.227,"--Well, I should say that future dangerousness is not likely to be at issue in... in cases where State law does not provide the jury the freedom to consider it."
2001.00-9280,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.411,190.72,"Well, how many States that use the death penalty allow future dangerousness as a factor in sentencing?"
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,190.72,192.555,"--You know, I don't have an exact number."
2001.00-9280,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.326,226.299,"Well, that is the concern, of course, is if... whether this concept is something that is going to have to be applied in every capital sentencing case or whether there's some limitation."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,226.299,227.243,--Well--
2001.00-9280,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.243,231.782,And it's hard to know from your argument the answer to that.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,233.19,234.614,--Yes.
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.579,267.489,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,291.201,302.449,"--Well, for example, the prosecutor here took on the issue of the fact that this young man was only 17 years old, and his... and had no prior record, both very substantial mitigating factors."
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.846,325.163,"Now... now, you're relying on the statement of... of the prosecutor--"
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,325.163,326.47,"Yes, in part."
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.47,328.678,--on his use of the word frightening.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,332.55,333.126,"Yes, he does."
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.126,336.102,"Now, that's one thing if you want to... and... and we... we can discuss that."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,355.558,359.499,"Well, I mean, we should recall that... that... I mean, one can say, well, these are just the facts of the crime."
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.785,377.995,That will always be the case.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,407.579,408.497,--It most certainly is.
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.497,409.169,Okay.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,412.449,435.265,"I think there would be no harm, although this case provides absolutely no occasion to consider the issue, in dispensing with the future dangerousness requirement for precisely that reason, that when... that it is... there are so few cases in which the jury is not likely, in the privacy of the jury room, to ask the question, what if he gets out and does it again?"
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.121,532.321,You're asking us to overrule Simmons.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,532.321,533.67,"No, by no means."
2001.00-9280,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.915,560.523,But that isn't the question you presented in your petition.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,566.411,571.041,"--Well, that's right because I represent a client and all my client requires is that Simmons be applied."
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,589.307,594.001,"Well, for the reasons that we've indicated in our questions, I... I don't think it's defiance."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,602.694,603.201,--Yes.
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,603.201,603.979,And it makes it a little troublesome--
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,650.843,652.278,"Well, I think that--"
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,652.278,653.947,I take it that would be a fair argument?
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,653.947,665.686,"--I don't think it would be for a separate reason, which is it invites the... the jury to treat the law under which this person is being sentenced as in effect nonexistent."
2001.00-9280,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.454,676.422,"Yes, but... but the certainty that life without parole will confine him indefinitely is much less than that execution will kill him."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,676.422,678.001,That's true.
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,689.675,692.55,"Well, would you allow the prosecutor to argue it if you were the trial judge?"
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,692.55,696.038,"--No, I would not because to invite the jury to--"
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,696.038,701.915,"So, you're saying that the jury doesn't need to be told what it already knows, but that's inconsistent with your whole position."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,701.915,702.55,--No.
2001.00-9280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,719.825,729.318,I thought your position... I thought your position was that this... that the judge or the lawyer reads the text of what it says in the South Carolina law.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,729.318,729.707,--Exactly.
2001.00-9280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,729.707,732.289,Reads word for word what the legislature enacted.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,732.289,733.457,That is exactly correct.
2001.00-9280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,733.457,734.257,And that's all you're asking.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,734.257,735.227,That's all we're asking.
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.755,738.203,Wait.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,761.99,765.681,"--Well, I have to say my case does not turn on the answer to that question."
2001.00-9280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.63,787.526,"In all the other States, in... in every other State that has capital punishment--"
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,787.526,788.662,Yes.
2001.00-9280,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.662,790.411,--this instruction is given as a matter of course?
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,790.411,796.059,Regardless of any absence or presence or alleged absence of future dangerousness.
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,812.785,820.699,"When you say it's outliers, but once again that's the... that's the dichotomy that this Court set forth in... in Simmons and in our past opinions."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,820.699,822.795,"--Well, yes."
2001.00-9280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.39,867.446,But what about the argument that everything that goes to future dangerousness also goes to something else?
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,889.734,900.678,"Well, it's... it's... there's very little evidence of future dangerousness and very little argument that cannot also be given a retributive interpretation, which is what the State has labored to do in their brief."
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.297,937.707,So what?
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,939.233,939.723,Because it ain't so.
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.723,940.913,What is so absurd about that?
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,946.657,950.982,"Well, there was no psychiatric opinion introduced by the State in Simmons itself."
2001.00-9280,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.196,1092.833,He just didn't like being confined.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1092.833,1093.196,--I'm sorry?
2001.00-9280,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1093.196,1095.308,Maybe he just didn't like being confined.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1097.356,1101.884,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, anything is possible, but that does not commend itself to our common sense."
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1116.044,1117.639,"Well, I'm not sure about that inference."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1130.305,1135.793,"That... as I say, the... the evidence has two meanings and that is one of them."
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1139.004,1141.639,"Well, then you can't say it defies all logic, et cetera, et cetera."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1150.593,1158.321,"--Even if it is the most direct, how can we say that it does not also prove that if you let him out on parole, he'll be even more dangerous?"
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.321,1159.153,But that isn't what Simmons said.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1187.137,1188.284,Right.
2001.00-9280,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.284,1190.087,But this is far beyond that.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1198.337,1215.324,"Well, I think it... it... what we have here is a prosecutor who has Simmons and who knows that if he wants to hide from the jury... you see, the prosecution agrees with us about... and this is, in a way, what is most disturbing and troubling about this case."
2001.00-9280,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1269.628,1278.369,"But this... this is not a case, is it, in... where the trial judge put any limitation on the defense attorney's arguing this point or where the jury came back with a question."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1279.5,1280.705,Right.
2001.00-9280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1342.113,1350.263,"But Shafer was explicit that counsel would not be allowed to read the statute, which is what I think counsel wanted to do."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1350.263,1351.212,"Well, that's right."
2001.00-9280,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.773,1515.383,"Well, perhaps... you suggested in your brief that for the future the South Carolina legislature is going to require that the jury be informed."
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1515.383,1516.615,"--Prospectively, yes."
2001.00-9280,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.381,1551.954,"May I ask, as a matter of historical interest, when did the requirement that the... I mean, when did... when did the sentence of life without parole first authorized by the South Carolina--"
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1551.954,1554.242,--The very first time came in... in 1986.
2001.00-9280,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.242,1555.191,--1986.
2001.00-9280,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1555.191,1564.605,"And thereafter, the South Carolina Supreme Court first handed down a truth-in-sentencing rule and then reversed itself just before Simmons, and Simmons was the first case tried under the new regime."
2001.00-9280,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.599,1569.746,"Very well, Mr. Bruck."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1571.922,1589.986,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Simmons v. South Carolina, a limited due process exception was crafted to the general rule in California v. Ramos that it was for the States to decide whether to inform the juries on matters of parole or other early release."
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1650.525,1661.693,"Mr. Waters, in... in your view has any South Carolina prosecutor since Simmons used words that would invoke that case?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1661.693,1663.41,--Invoke Simmons itself?
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1663.41,1664.301,Yes.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1680.429,1692.759,"Well, I think, you know, our State Supreme Court has on two occasions ruled that Simmons was violated, and in that case, the... the prosecutor argued that, you know, he's shown that he cannot live inside or outside of prison."
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1696.509,1700.695,"I thought your position was if he couldn't live in prison, then Simmons was out."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1700.695,1706.119,"--Well, in that particular case, he said both outside of society and inside prison in that particular case."
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1711.261,1726.365,"You... you then concede that if the... if the argument that counsel for the... the prosecutor makes is this man is dangerous in or out of prison, in that case a Simmons instruction is warranted."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1726.365,1734.93,"--I think that by incorporating the outside society aspect of the argument, our State Supreme Court has already ruled that and I'm not here to... to challenge that."
2001.00-9280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.93,1759.591,"I understood Justice Ginsburg's question... and I'm interested in it too... as can you tell us, as a matter of practice, are there instances in where the Simmons rule is followed in South Carolina and the jury is instructed about parole because of future dangerous being an issue, or as Justice Ginsburg suggested, is it the common pattern and practice for prosecution... for the prosecutor to stay away from this?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1759.591,1760.29,No.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1777.65,1779.895,Don't you have that here?
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1823.01,1824.829,I don't believe so in this case.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1830.829,1837.41,"Well, I'm not talking about... I mean, you... the majority of the argument isn't even the criterion that you are arguing for."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1853.821,1863.223,"--Well, with regard to the dangerous comment, what the solicitor said in that particular case was... he said, well, the evidence here is that he's quick-witted, he's not retarded."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1876.226,1877.709,"Well, what... what about the 30 feet?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1887.533,1894.343,That... that particular argument was... was made at... at the beginning of the sentencing phase in opening statement.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1896.343,1897.666,"I mean, it was made to the jurors."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1898.829,1904.813,"--They did hear that, but I think if you read it in context, it was more of the case of you just committed... convicted this guy of a horrible crime."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1919.357,1923.794,"So, if... if the prosecutor had closed his argument with that, that would have sufficed."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1923.794,1925.831,I'm not... I don't know if I would say that much.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1950.647,1959.762,"He didn't... my... my... you correct me if I'm wrong, because I don't have the transcript in front of me, but my recollection is he didn't say, I hope you don't have to go through this again."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,1967.474,1977.037,"--Well, he... he did not say, I hope you don't have to go through that, but I think if you read his argument, that was the point of it, and I think in context, that's the obvious point of it rather than future dangerousness."
2001.00-9280,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1977.037,1979.074,May I ask this?
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2007.522,2012.663,"In that... in that particular case, the solicitor focused much of his argument on that."
2001.00-9280,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2038.573,2044.536,But you would draw a line depending in part on how much the issue was emphasized in the argument.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2047.469,2063.917,"What I'm saying is that if there's an isolated comment in the context of an... of an argument that focuses on retribution, that... it's kind of a Donnelly v. DeChristoforo principle, that you shouldn't assume that the prosecutor intended to worst meaning from that, and you shouldn't assume that the jury necessarily took the worst meaning from that."
2001.00-9280,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2103.315,2106.883,"Well, why shouldn't... why shouldn't it be?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2157.859,2163.475,"Well, I think the jury in this case... you know, they are told life imprisonment, and they're never told that there's any possibility of--"
2001.00-9280,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.475,2169.246,"But sitting... in your experience, wouldn't you say most jurors are sitting there thinking that life doesn't mean life?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2169.246,2173.113,"--Well, I... I'm not sure that that's necessarily true."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2197.529,2201.198,What does deference to the State got to do with fundamental fairness?
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2229.769,2241.881,"--Well, I think that the... the ineligibility of parole, as this Court held in Simmons, is only directly relevant to future dangerousness to society argument, and that, of course, was the due process rationale followed in Simmons."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2261.454,2272.121,"Well, in... in Simmons, there's no question that the future dangerousness issue, together with the jury's question and so on, presented an egregious case of... of a need for instruction."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2272.121,2273.369,--Yes.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2273.369,2281.635,"But let's... let's assume... and I don't believe this is this case, even remotely, but let's assume we had a case in which somehow future dangerousness were not an issue."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2311.054,2315.289,"Well, again, the jury is told we're dealing with death or life imprisonment."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2315.289,2317.993,"No, but that simply begs the question."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2346.953,2354.211,I think that that depends that... that be all to end all is the without parole context of life.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2361.454,2362.814,You bet I assume that.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2380.43,2389.294,"--Well, again, I would have to fall back to the fact of is the only aspect of the State's case that it rebuts is future dangerousness to society."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2390.841,2398.627,"And my question to you is let's assume a case in which that is not the issue, a case in which we're talking about retribution."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2405.033,2413.374,"--Because if it is a purely retributive case and... and future dangerousness was not an issue, then there is nothing fundamentally unfair."
2001.00-9280,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.339,2457.715,"Yes, but the... the argument to the contrary would be if you were sitting there thinking that this terrible murderer is in front of you and you are asked what is the appropriate punishment, and on the one hand you were told it's death, and on the other hand you were told... well, you're not told because a person who wants to retribute, wants vengeance, would surely like to know that the alternative to death, which is surely vengeance, is life in prison forever, not just life in prison for 10 or 15 years."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2466.35,2477.71,"I don't know if you can necessarily assume that's the case when the jury hears evidence and they're instructed on what to consider and the focus of the evidence is his adaptability in prison, which is the case in this case and many other cases."
2001.00-9280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.267,2519.198,"I assume that the reason for these rules were just... just State principles that the law says what it says, and we don't want to get into the refinements of... of how long a life sentence may be."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2542.537,2545.998,--There... there are a number of... of jurisdictions that have wrestled with that.
2001.00-9280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.291,2589.102,"Is the prosecution allowed to argue in South Carolina when... when the choice is... is life or death, is the prosecution allowed to argue the possibility of commutation?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2589.102,2590.659,"No, no."
2001.00-9280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.809,2600.35,"Well, that's not really very fair, is it?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2610.499,2612.99,"--Absolutely, absolutely, and I would agree with that."
2001.00-9280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.99,2614.937,Or the... all the law can be changed?
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2614.937,2616.393,Or it could be changed.
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2616.393,2619.779,"The South Carolina Supreme Court hasn't dealt with that issue, though, has it?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2640.681,2641.785,Not of which I'm aware.
2001.00-9280,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2659.135,2663.508,"Well, then the South Carolina Supreme Court itself changed its rule on that?"
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2663.508,2665.071,It had.
2001.00-9280,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.807,2751.108,"Yes, but he was trying to get the... prevent the jury from getting this information."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2751.108,2752.879,--That's true.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2763.828,2771.321,"And... and he also kind of snuck in the word dangerousness there in the... in the 30-foot example, but they don't count because they weren't prominent in his argument."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2771.321,2774.644,"--Well, I'd... I'd like to... to address that specifically."
2001.00-9280,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2779.892,2783.961,What... what passage are we... are we talking about a passage?
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2790.143,2791.247,"--No, not at all."
2001.00-9280,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2791.247,2794.009,I thought perhaps from his question that's what we were talking about.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2794.009,2798.649,"What he... what he was doing was he said, okay, this defendant is quick-witted."
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2817.94,2819.289,"Mr. Waters, it wasn't quite like that."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2828.207,2832.169,"Well, I don't know if you can necessarily read that that was at a protracted period."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2850.655,2852.585,And she was outside prison when this happened.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2852.585,2855.044,"She was outside prison, but this is retribution."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2899.775,2905.508,"But if he is a danger inside, it follows that he will be a danger outside if he gets out."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2908.831,2911.823,--I... I don't think the link is... is so readily made.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2914.228,2929.151,"Well, the... the evidence of... of his dangerousness included things that he used to like to torture small animals, psychiatric evidence to the effect that he wants to... to take action, homicidal action, against anybody who annoys him."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2940.073,2945.007,"--Well, in that particular instance, number one, the prosecution never used any of that in his closing argument."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2945.908,2947.876,"Well, it brought out in its cross examination."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2947.876,2948.655,--Absolutely.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2960.628,2961.919,Let's... let's assume that.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,2983.903,2996.996,"--I think that that... that evidence is very close, but I would... I would assert that... that the way it was used in this particular case to respond to adaptability, which is dangerousness within prison, which was the specific issue that was focused before this jury."
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2997.711,3009.359,"But what started all of this, I thought, was... was the point that you were making that the evidence that went to dangerousness in prison did not ground in inference of dangerousness outside."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3010.905,3011.631,--No.
2001.00-9280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3071.327,3075.652,"And it is important to the State, I suppose, to show that he will be dangerous in prison."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3075.652,3076.692,"Oh, absolutely."
2001.00-9280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.439,3083.071,The jury presumably would not want to give a life sentence to someone who's going to continue to kill in prison.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3083.071,3084.729,--Absolutely.
2001.00-9280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3090.612,3095.348,"The argument is made whenever the State makes that point, that perfectly valid point, to the jury."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3098.884,3102.233,--I'm sorry?
2001.00-9280,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.689,3113.129,"The argument made is that when the State makes that perfectly valid point about dangerousness in prison, it automatically triggers Simmons."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3123.273,3125.321,Correct.
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3125.684,3130.959,But that really doesn't help you here because here you further had evidence of his escape risk.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3130.959,3131.588,--And--
2001.00-9280,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3131.588,3137.284,So that this wasn't a guy who was just going to sit quietly and... and enjoy his time in prison.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3146.276,3148.948,--And I think that that's... I would agree with that wholeheartedly.
2001.00-9280,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.679,3177.497,"So, you should have been happy with the instruction is what that proves."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3177.497,3178.185,I'm sorry?
2001.00-9280,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.185,3179.775,You should have been happy with the instruction.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3179.775,3181.263,With the?
2001.00-9280,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.263,3183.583,Because you're concentrating on what would happen in prison.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3187.023,3187.833,What?
2001.00-9280,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.132,3190.825,This fellow is going to be kept where he'll be the most dangerous.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3193.257,3194.335,--No.
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3235.812,3249.871,"Mr. Waters, you didn't really mean... your brief could be read to say that... that the lawyer was effectively allowed to tell the jury that life means life."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3257.978,3259.114,Right.
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3259.114,3261.77,It's no different than... from what it was in Shafer in that respect.
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3261.77,3274.629,"I... I fully understand what Shafer held, and my only point with that was, was that the reasons that... that this Court relied upon in Shafer were not present in this case, to why those were not sufficient, and that was, number one, the jury asked."
2001.00-9280,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3283.482,3295.221,"But you... but you don't dispute that if the... if the lawyer then... if she had tried to say in open court, now, jurors, I'm going to read you from the South Carolina, that she would have her head cut off by the judge."
2001.00-9280,1,42274,s_creighton_waters,,3295.221,3297.839,--I think it's very unlikely the trial judge would have allowed her to do that.
2001.00-9280,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3364.181,3364.997,"Thank you, Mr. Waters."
2001.00-9280,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3367.429,3368.869,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2001.00-9280,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3403.354,3408.474,"The Supreme Court of South Carolina, I gather from your opponent, shifted its position too."
2001.00-9280,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3408.474,3408.81,"--Yes, it did."
2001.00-9280,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.81,3410.191,And what was the reason for that?
2001.00-9280,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3410.191,3413.002,It's not entirely clear.
2001.00-9280,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3457.045,3460.106,"When you say commutation, that's all synonymous with--"
2001.00-9280,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3460.106,3460.757,--Clemency.
2001.00-9280,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3460.757,3461.109,--clemency?
2001.00-9280,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3461.109,3462.33,That's right.
2001.00-9280,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3609.045,3609.824,"Thank you, Mr. Bruck."
2001.00-9280,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3609.824,3610.192,--Thank you.
2001.00-9280,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3610.192,3613.371,The case is submitted.
