1991.90-7675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.951,"We'll hear argument now in 90-7675, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, Minnesota."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,9.747,14.886,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-7675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,75.813,92.166,"Mr. Cleary, in reading your briefs, it appeared to me that you were arguing a case other than the one presented, which I thought involved the statute as construed by the Minnesota supreme court."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,92.166,93.041,--I did go into great--
1991.90-7675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.041,100.398,"Now, do you agree at this point that we are looking at the statute as the Minnesota supreme court has interpreted it?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,100.398,100.772,--Yes.
1991.90-7675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.772,104.802,Not as it could theoretically have been interpreted?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,104.802,105.255,Yes.
1991.90-7675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.656,142.755,"And in essence what the Minnesota supreme court appears to have said is, we interpret the law as reaching only those exceptions that the Supreme Court has recognized to the First Amendment... fighting words, for instance, out of our prior Chaplinsky case."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,146.956,154.422,I agree that the Court attempted to narrow the ordinance and in doing so cited Chaplinsky and Brandenburg to this Court.
1991.90-7675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.422,162.934,"Right, and in essence they said what that statute means is what the Supreme Court has permitted in Brandenburg and Chaplinsky."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,162.934,164.684,"They did cite those cases, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.875,207.354,"Well, if we thought that the Minnesota court recognized that the Minnesota statute reaches only what was said in Chaplinsky could survive and in Brandenburg what survived, would you still be here?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,207.354,210.884,"I would still object to the ordinance as construed, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.884,216.381,So you would ask us to somehow overturn those older holdings.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,216.381,220.865,"No, I don't believe it's necessary to do that, Your Honor, to get to the position that I'm requesting."
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,278.215,292.538,"Well, in your view, what is the constitutional boundaries for the fighting words doctrine, only those words which would provoke some other person to an assault on the speaker, physical assault?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,292.538,300.02,"--From this Court's opinions, Your Honor, I believe it's limited to those words that bring on an immediate breach of peace, the reflexive violence idea."
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.811,327.65,"May a State validly proscribe words that cause alarm and fear for one's safety, even if the fear for the breach of the safety is some act that will occur maybe 24 hours, 48 hours later?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,327.65,348.342,"I believe so, Your Honor, and I believe so in terms of a viewpoint-neutral type of law that may address the content of what you're referring to but would do so in terms of immediate breach of peace, or would do so in terms of another law such as a threat law, a terrorist or threat law which I think would be permissible and even fit the alleged fact situation in this case."
1991.90-7675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.521,384.423,"Mr. Cleary, isn't one of your complaints that the Minnesota statute as construed by the supreme court of Minnesota punishes only some fighting words and not others?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,384.423,385.22,"--It is, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.35,458.096,Do you understand the Supreme Court of Minnesota to have decided one way or another whether the conduct of this particular petitioner is included in the statute?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,458.096,465.875,"No, I did not decide... I did not see their opinion as directly deciding whether or not the conduct of the petitioner was included."
1991.90-7675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.875,468.702,It left that presumably for the State district court.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,468.702,469.574,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.01,478.213,But it held that the complaint should not be dismissed?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,478.213,479.446,"--I'm sorry, Justice."
1991.90-7675,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.446,481.103,Didn't it uphold the charge?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,482.585,483.992,"No, it has not gone back for trial."
1991.90-7675,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.992,490.879,The Supreme Court did not send it back for trial?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,490.879,492.41,"Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood the question."
1991.90-7675,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.925,500.235,"If they did send it back for trial, is it not necessarily true that they held that the allegations in the complaint alleged a violation of the statute?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,500.235,508.966,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because it was an overbreadth challenge and I think what they were saying was that the ordinance itself was constitutional after the narrow construction, but I--"
1991.90-7675,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,508.966,517.462,"But in the other case you cite, or your opponent, I guess, that's the S.L.J. case, when they narrowly construed it they said, therefore the conduct isn't within the statute and they dismissed the charge."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,517.462,517.946,--They did.
1991.90-7675,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.57,525.257,But you think they left open the question whether the complaint should be dismissed or not.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,525.257,531.269,"Well, I think they left open how the ordinance, once narrowly construed, would affect this alleged conduct, yes."
1991.90-7675,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.049,536.783,But normally you're more interested in judgments.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,541.422,543.123,--If you've been charged with an offense--
1991.90-7675,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.123,545.748,"But whether permissibly charged... well, okay."
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.623,553.682,"Mr. Cleary, I don't understand the comments you made earlier in response to the Chief Justice."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,603.959,605.629,"--Yes, there are, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.629,610.379,So then why do you have any doubt about whether it's just giving examples?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,628.683,629.293,That is right.
1991.90-7675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.293,634.385,"That's what you said to me, was it not?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,634.385,639.869,"Well, what I said was, the respondent's position is that these were mere examples and that there was not a viewpoint selected and discriminated against."
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.869,645.944,"Yes, and I thought you said, even if that is so, and I didn't understand you to be contradicting that categorically."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,645.944,648.349,"Well, I am... I am suggesting that's not true."
1991.90-7675,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,670.964,678.869,"With respect to words that injure, is it your position that the only words that injure that can constitutionally be punished are threats?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,678.869,680.289,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,680.289,681.96,Threats to immediate harm?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,681.96,682.71,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,683.195,684.71,How do you... where do you want to draw the line?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,684.71,691.613,"--Well, I'm not suggesting the Court need overrule Chaplinsky, which talks about immediate breach of peace, and those would not necessarily have to be threatening words."
1991.90-7675,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,694.299,703.217,"I guess I was drawing the Chaplinsky distinction between the fighting words and the words that injure, and I thought they were talking about two separate categories."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,709.168,710.746,--I think the Court was talking about two separate categories.
1991.90-7675,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,710.746,710.839,Okay.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,715.104,719.603,"I believe, Your Honor, that that... I'll be very honest."
1991.90-7675,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.398,739.719,Is it hard enough so that in fact we have to say that that simply was a mistaken statement and disavow it and leave Chaplinsky with the fighting words category in the strict sense as a lone subject to punishment?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,739.719,741.843,"--No, I don't believe so."
1991.90-7675,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.84,766.771,"Well, I agree, but aren't you really coming to the point of saying that the Chaplinsky reference to words that injure was in fact, at least by today's standards, an erroneous reference and we should disavow Chaplinsky to that extent?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,766.771,767.318,--I am.
1991.90-7675,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,767.318,768.317,Okay.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,768.317,780.296,"The debate in this case is not about the wisdom of eradicating intolerance, the debate is about the method of reaching that goal."
1991.90-7675,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,831.901,836.305,"Mr. Cleary, do you think that Chaplinsky was wrongly decided?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,836.305,839.211,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting Chaplinsky has to be overruled."
1991.90-7675,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,847.067,851.533,"Of course, it was written on behalf of the Court by one of the great liberals of the country."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,861.857,870.151,"I don't believe that it has to be overruled to reverse this decision, Your Honor, because I think the inflict injury and the Brandenburg misconstruction is more important in terms of this opinion."
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.151,876.695,I thought your answer to me was that an immediate breach of the peace is not required.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,876.695,878.929,"No, I didn't mean to suggest that, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,883.428,894.313,"What is the constitutional test that you propose for those fighting words, whatever that means, which can be proscribed?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,894.313,901.919,If the Court... the Court has spent 50 years redefining the lines of Chaplinsky.
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,922.864,926.723,"Well, is the theory that the hearer will commit violence on the speaker?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,926.723,932.61,I think the theory of Chaplinsky is a hostile audience idea as opposed to Brandenburg.
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,932.61,936.344,And is that the theory the State proceeds on here so far as you understand the case?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,936.344,938.656,"Yes, I believe so."
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,940.856,946.088,And is that theory constitutional so far as applied to this statute?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,946.088,953.696,"--It's constitutional in the sense that immediate breach of peace is still good law under Chaplinsky, yes."
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,963.566,963.847,All right.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,977.421,979.703,I believe it could.
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,979.703,979.968,On these facts?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,979.968,981.123,I believe it could.
1991.90-7675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,997.867,999.943,"Well, you say it's underinclusive."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,999.943,1008.893,"I do, Your Honor, in the sense, not necessarily exactly like Erznoznik, but in the sense that it definitely picks and betrays government neutrality."
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.183,1074.914,"Mr. Cleary, going back to what Justice Kennedy was asking about, the fighting words doctrine, it depends case by case on the reaction of the person who hears the words, is that right?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1074.914,1076.413,"That is as I understand it, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.413,1084.081,"So you can use any language whatever in a Quaker community, if you are in a solid Quaker community, you can be much more insulting than you can somewhere else."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1086.767,1087.876,I think it... pardon me?
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.876,1088.689,Does that make a lot of sense?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1088.689,1099.544,"No, but it does rely on audience reaction, the idea of Chaplinsky does rely on audience reaction, the reflexive violence idea, and everyone is going to be different, but that kind of runs right into what I am referring to on the injury idea."
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1101.73,1106.651,Might it not be a reasonable man standard?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1118.459,1121.644,"--In terms of the immediate breach of peace, it might be."
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.644,1122.02,Yes.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1137.059,1138.465,I agree--
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1138.465,1142.917,So it doesn't necessarily depend on the particular people to whom the words are addressed.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1143.807,1170.702,"--No, except that I think it has been a case-by-case adjudication for 50 years under Chaplinsky in terms of the immediate breach of peace and getting into a reasonable man standard on immediate breach of peace I think would be much easier to litigate than the inflict injury because I think the inflict injury brings us back to the Boos v. Barry and Hustler Magazine idea, that political discourse involves outrageousness, and these are the some of the major issues of our day and there are going to be intolerant opinions displayed."
1991.90-7675,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1171.374,1175.389,Have you had anymore cross burnings in St. Paul since this incident?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1175.389,1177.075,"--I am not aware of any, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1179.527,1181.448,"Well, there certainly would be publicity--"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1181.448,1182.917,"I think there would in St. Paul, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.943,1233.818,--So you think they can't be fighting words per se?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1233.818,1235.785,The symbols themselves?
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.785,1241.955,"There is no such thing as a fighting word per se, you always... this is going back to our prior discussion."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1243.625,1244.25,I agree.
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.31,1272.645,"So the Quakers have no protection or the peaceful family that would not punch out someone who waved a swastika in their face, that's their misfortune, that they are so law-abiding as not to be violent, and therefore, what would otherwise be fighting words can be used against them."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1272.645,1278.175,"--I think the tension, Justice Scalia is between the First Amendment right of expression and the--"
1991.90-7675,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.175,1291.513,"Well, I know that is the tension, but why is it that there can't be such a thing as a fighting word per se, a kind of a word that would be likely to provoke a violent reaction from an ordinary person."
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1295.199,1305.226,--I think the danger in that is that it could lead to a total ban of language or of symbols or other expression that any community would call fighting words per se.
1991.90-7675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.867,1314.472,"Certainly the Court's opinion in Texas against Johnson suggested that there couldn't be a fighting symbol at any rate, per se, did it not?"
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1314.472,1317.096,"--That's correct, Chief Justice."
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.331,1361.267,Suppose the listener fears for the listener's safety?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1367.28,1369.765,"Describing a threat, Your Honor?"
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1369.765,1369.984,Yes.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1371.622,1378.261,I think it is pursuant to a viewpoint-neutral law in terms of a decision as to whether there is an intent to threaten.
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1378.261,1380.557,I take it the threat in your view has to be imminent?
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1380.557,1391.457,I believe that there would need to be a finding of intent to threaten and so therefore that would be one of the considerations as to whether or not it was imminent or not.
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1391.457,1398.862,Suppose the listener fears for the listener's safety over the period of the next month.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1401.313,1403.735,It is hard to draw the line on--
1991.90-7675,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1403.735,1408.749,There are 15 policemen there when the cross is being burned and so there is no imminent danger in that sense.
1991.90-7675,0,22057,edward_j_cleary,,1408.749,1424.289,"--There is certainly communication and it certainly could be considered a threat, and I believe a prosecution pursuant to a viewpoint-neutral law such as terroristic threats might address that, but I don't believe this law either as written or narrowly construed would be the law to address that."
1991.90-7675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.523,1430.488,"Thank you, Mr. Cleary."
1991.90-7675,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1431.848,1438.595,"Mr. Foley, before you get started, let me ask a couple of trivial questions."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1439.705,1440.83,"Yes, I am, Justice Blackmun."
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1440.83,1443.312,And yet the city is the respondent here.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1443.312,1460.445,"Yes, under Minnesota law, Justice Blackmun, the county attorney handles all matters involving juveniles and this matter was a prosecution of a juvenile, so we represent any activity, whether the matter is under a city ordinance or State ordinance or a Federal crime."
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1460.445,1466.615,And this is why the city is a party to one of the amicus briefs as well as being the respondent in the case.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1466.615,1468.193,"That's correct, Justice Blackmun."
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1468.193,1469.723,"A little unusual, I suppose."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1469.723,1470.864,It is an unusual--
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1470.864,1473.488,Let me ask one other trivial question.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1476.94,1477.331,"--Yes, it did."
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1477.331,1478.518,Whereabouts on Earl Street?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1482.939,1485.547,290 Earl Street.
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1485.547,1487.062,Hm?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1487.062,1488.203,290 Earl Street.
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1488.203,1489.546,"I know that, but where is 290?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1491.936,1493.483,"I don't have the cross street, Justice Blackmun."
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1493.483,1493.779,You don't know--
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1498.246,1499.636,It's near Mounds Park.
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1499.636,1508.632,I was up there last June with some U.S. Marshals who had never been there.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1524.578,1527.765,"Justice, under our Constitution everyone is presumed innocent until they've had a trial."
1991.90-7675,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.718,1532.825,"Mr. Foley, if you're going to make all these concessions you might as well sit down now."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1537.668,1542.431,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-7675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.793,1587.975,"Mr. Foley, do you agree with your colleague on the other side that the supreme court of Minnesota in its opinion did not decide whether the conduct with which R.A.V. was charged came under the ordinance?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1587.975,1599.751,"Your Honor, it's our contention that the Minnesota supreme court, yes, did decide that the conduct came under the ordinance and set it back for trial on the merits."
1991.90-7675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.751,1600.86,So you and he disagree on that?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1600.86,1601.657,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-7675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1636.487,1665.179,"Well, Mr. Foley, would you address the concern expressed by your opponent that the ordinance is limited to only fighting words that arouse anger, alarm, or resentment on the basis of race, color, creed, or religion or gender and not other fighting words that could cause the same reaction in people?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1670.053,1691.403,"Your Honor, it's our position that the statute is not underinclusive, that this is a fighting words case, that this is unprotected conduct under the First Amendment, and that the City of St. Paul has the right to determine which harms it can proscribe within the limits of its jurisdiction."
1991.90-7675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1691.403,1700.477,"Well, certainly it is limited by subject matter or content of the fighting words that are spoken, is it not?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1705.726,1715.486,"Your Honor, it's our position that it is not a content-based ordinance, that it certainly could be used to be a content-neutral ordinance."
1991.90-7675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1715.486,1724.702,"Well, but it doesn't cover fighting words that are not limited to words on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1724.702,1725.405,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.405,1731.309,"So why, I mean, how can you possibly say it isn't content-based to that extent?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1731.309,1771.901,"Your Honor, we have alternative theories that it is content-based, but it is unprotected conduct because it is fighting words, but we also believe that the main purpose of the ordinance is not to limit freedom of expression in that the harm that it's attempting to regulate is neutral and it could be considered content-neutral under the Renton-Barnes analysis that this Court has engaged in, but even if the Court feels that it is content-based, that there is a compelling State purpose in public safety and order and safety of their citizens for the City of St. Paul to pass such an ordinance."
1991.90-7675,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.901,1772.291,Why is that?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1828.645,1839.798,I think the city has an absolute right and purpose to try to regulate the harm that goes onto its citizens.
1991.90-7675,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.998,1847.888,That's a political judgment.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1867.584,1885.2,"--Your Honor, the City of St. Paul is attempting to fashion responses to violence that it deems necessary to prohibit and will add additional harms to be regulated as it finds them."
1991.90-7675,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.868,1894.806,It doesn't have to add anything.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1912.69,1924.186,"Your Honor, I think it's the city's position that this is a fighting words case, that the ordinance has been sufficiently narrowed by the Minnesota supreme court."
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1948.363,1958.186,"Well, are you saying that because they can prevent or punish all fighting words, they can select any category within the broad scope of fighting words for it to be singled out?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1958.186,1959.077,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1959.077,1966.339,"If that is true, then why isn't it equally true in a case in which there's a time, place, or manner restriction?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1980.568,1988.348,The... I think they can specify the harm.
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1988.348,1990.424,"We can have content-based time, place, and manner?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,1990.424,1990.846,Yes.
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2016.194,2023.911,"So you're saying fighting words simply is not protected speech as such, and therefore, we can select anything within the category of fighting words."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2027.924,2028.377,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2028.377,2049.101,"Isn't it true that the, at least up to now, that any concept we may have had of fighting words has been a concept which took fighting words as a whole and assumed that to the extent that they could be punished, they would be punished as fighting words, not as categories within fighting words?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2052.321,2057.63,I don't believe we would be making new law under that analysis.
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2101.427,2111.437,"Mr. Foley, does the fact of the burning of the cross on the lawn of the Jones family have any bearing here?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2118.154,2127.243,It does have a bearing on the violation of this ordinance in how you analyze what is a violation of fighting words.
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2153.046,2158.919,What if the burning were done in front of the Ramsey County courthouse at Wabasha and Kellogg Boulevard?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2158.919,2160.621,--Your Honor--
1991.90-7675,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2160.621,2162.917,"Or in a different situation, around the plaza of the State Capitol?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2162.917,2173.771,"--Your Honor, we believe this ordinance would not be applicable if the burning cross was done in a public forum or in a political parade of some sort."
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.688,2190.874,Let me... may I interrupt with this question?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2201.183,2209.57,"Not with... it would not unless there was the intent to cause, to inflict injury--"
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.57,2210.555,Those are the only facts you know.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2215.661,2223.018,--There's an element of intent with the ordinance saying know or have reason to know that it would arouse--
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.018,2227.234,"That it would arouse anger, alarm, or resentment in others."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2238.184,2247.883,"--It would not arouse anger, alarm, or resentment under the fighting words doctrine as the Minnesota supreme court had previously construed that language in the S.L.J. case."
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.203,2270.593,"--But you have not alleged in count 2 that is targeted at a particular individual, as I understand it."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2270.593,2276.606,--The burning of the cross in the fenced yard--
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2276.606,2281.276,We don't know anything except what's in the... alleged in counts 1 and 2 of the information.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2281.276,2283.524,--I think it's important to look at the facts that--
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.524,2286.366,"But this, it came up on motion to dismiss, didn't it?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2286.366,2287.397,"--Yes it did, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.397,2289.927,Now how can we look at anything except what you've alleged in the complaint?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2289.927,2299.939,"On a, on a motion to dismiss the facts of the file are all construed on behalf of the nonmoving party."
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.939,2302.204,But you can't make up facts that you have it alleged.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2302.204,2310.389,"No, but the facts that have been submitted to the court and all of the police reports that go to the intent of the--"
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.389,2313.714,You mean the police reports are a part of the charging papers?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2313.714,2320.821,"--In Minnesota we have filed all of the police reports in, with the petition to the court."
1991.90-7675,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.821,2321.212,Are they in the record?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2321.212,2324.492,They should be submitted to you and have all the police reports.
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.492,2338.782,"Mr. Foley, I'm having trouble with terminology and it may be my fault, but I have assumed that Chaplinsky spoke to two different categories, the words that injure category and the fighting words category."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2360.727,2364.959,My understanding of the Minnesota supreme court's construction is that it could be either.
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2390.683,2403.71,"Do you at least allege that there is a fighting words offense here, that there is an immediate breach of the peace implied by what you have alleged about the burning of the cross?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2403.71,2421.936,"Your Honor, I think we allege both prongs in this and that we would rely more heavily on the inflicts injury prong to the family, the Jones family, the burning of the cross in the middle of the night outside of their home is more than just outrageous conduct."
1991.90-7675,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2448.504,2450.049,"--I am sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2450.049,2450.284,--Excuse me.
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2456.406,2482.505,"Going back to your earlier answer, if I understand it, with respect to the infliction of injury point, your theory is that because the category of words that inflict injury are outside First Amendment protection, it is not an objection in this case that the particular words or expression that inflict injury are identified by means of content."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2484.584,2487.909,We think they can be content-based under those circumstances.
1991.90-7675,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2487.909,2489.3,For the reasons I just gave?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2489.3,2489.581,Yes.
1991.90-7675,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.837,2516.195,"Well, you say bias-motivated, but it depends on what your biases are."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2539.404,2543.637,I don't believe under the facts that you described that it would.
1991.90-7675,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.637,2547.011,It's the wrong kind of bias.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2561.973,2565.316,It's probably not addressed under this particular ordinance.
1991.90-7675,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.814,2573.392,--Why is that?
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2592.024,2615.733,"Well, there are many reasons that cities and State legislatures look to a particular wrong that they are attempting to address, and I don't think they address all of those wrongs at the same time, and they attempt to get as many of them as they can and they do address in a content-based... under certain circumstances, certain harms that they want to address and including--"
1991.90-7675,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.733,2620.231,"It wasn't hard, it wasn't hard to write this in such a way that it wouldn't discriminate in that fashion."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2627.854,2647.143,"--I think the Minnesota supreme court addressed or made reference to that issue when it said that the particular city ordinance could have been drawn a little bit better, but then went on to clearly narrow the impact of that ordinance and narrowed it only to apply to fighting words."
1991.90-7675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.514,2681.41,"Well, Mr. Foley, I would have thought you might respond to Justice Scalia's question by citing New York against Ferber for the proposition that if the language is unprotected by the Constitution as you assert is the case here, then underinclusiveness just doesn't apply."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2688.081,2705.793,"--We do rely on Ferber and FCC v. Pacifica as certain harms that this Court has looked at and addressed to protect certain individuals from harm, and certainly didn't mean to overlook the Ferber decision."
1991.90-7675,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.283,2742.81,"Mr. Foley, I take it you are not arguing that if the statute or the ordinance had not been narrowed by the supreme court that it would have, that it would be constitutional?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2742.81,2743.45,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.479,2755.21,"Well, don't you have some trouble, then, with the Lewis case in this Court--"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2755.21,2759.537,--I don't believe so--
1991.90-7675,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.537,2785.292,"--Lewis seemed to hold that although a State supreme court purported to narrow an ordinance to fighting words, that it just hadn't successfully done so, and do you think the narrowing that was done or attempted in this case was somewhat different than what the Louisiana court did, for example?"
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2785.292,2814.452,"--I believe, Justice White, your first question is that it would have been unconstitutional as written under the Gooding decision, and when the Lewis case was sent back in light of Gooding, the Louisiana supreme court essentially made very little effort to abide by the Gooding decision in how it referenced fighting words, but clearly the statute had a broader, more sweeping view of--"
1991.90-7675,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2814.452,2821.34,"Well, the supreme court said it was narrowing the law to fighting words."
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2825.964,2834.96,"--It said it was narrowing it to fighting words, but left in effect some of the language that was clearly... appropriate language that was clearly broader--"
1991.90-7675,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.96,2843.223,Your court didn't... it left the ordinance reading exactly what... left all the words in the ordinance in there.
1991.90-7675,1,42671,tom_foley,,2858.154,2862.059,--The Lewis Court just made a reference to fighting words.
1991.90-7675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2915.068,2917.677,"--Thank you, Mr. Foley."
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,2920.333,2921.191,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1991.90-7675,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.234,2969.766,Excuse me.
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,2973.546,2974.156,Yes.
1991.90-7675,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.156,2975.81,A general breach of peace ordinance that would have covered fighting words?
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,2975.81,2976.638,The S.L.J. was--
1991.90-7675,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.638,2977.107,All fighting words.
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,2977.107,2983.308,"--S.L.J. was narrowly construed by the Minnesota court to read, just fighting words without any subgroups or any of the rest of this language."
1991.90-7675,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.308,2989.446,So then you could say that the municipality's law as a whole did not discriminate on the basis of subject matter?
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,2998.083,3002.487,I am saying... the other ordinance would implicate the First Amendment but not in terms of the viewpoint neutrality and not in terms of the under inclusiveness.
1991.90-7675,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3002.487,3004.362,"Do we have that other ordinance, that--"
1991.90-7675,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.362,3005.205,"That's a statute, not an ordinance."
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,3005.205,3006.642,"It's cited in the briefs, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3006.642,3009.61,--Were there differences in penalties under one or the other?
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,3009.61,3009.97,No.
1991.90-7675,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.97,3011.313,They are exactly the same--
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,3011.313,3012.046,They are both misdemeanors.
1991.90-7675,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3012.046,3016.42,"--In S.L.J. wasn't it a statute, not an ordinance?"
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,3016.42,3017.512,"Excuse me, it was a statute."
1991.90-7675,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3021.136,3023.324,Where is the citation?
1991.90-7675,2,22057,edward_j_cleary,,3029.085,3029.523,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1991.90-7675,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3051.546,3053.437,"Thank you, Mr. Cleary."
