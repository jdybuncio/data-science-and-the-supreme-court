2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.504,"We'll hear argument next in case 05-1284, Watson versus Philip Morris Companies."
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,8.754,11.808,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.876,148.68,Do they cite any particular document or statement--
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,148.68,149.23,--No.
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.23,151.715,--that constitutes the delegation?
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,151.715,152.532,No.
2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,162.437,178.116,"So it's perfectly all right for them to adopt a new method of testing tar and nicotine that yields numbers that are far lower than the Government's method, and to publish an ad saying these are our tar and nicotine figures, and the FTC would have no problem with that?"
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,178.116,180.901,"Mr. Chief Justice, the answer to your question is no."
2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,197.343,201.231,"Not just the preferred method, but presumably the only one they would allow."
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,207.718,208.585,--That is correct.
2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,217.757,218.29,They still might--
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,223.244,224.461,--They most assuredly did get--
2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,287.503,294.84,"Well, I understand you have a dispute about whether that is this case, but there are many areas where the Government requires testing of products."
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,317.122,317.539,--No.
2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,326.811,336.167,"What if the Government says you've got to test your cars, you know, every three months or something, and you've got to send us the results of a random... random test?"
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,336.167,338.536,The reporting of results doesn't change the hypothetical.
2006.05-1284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.859,414.353,That is... this is certainly not your revenue officer needing help from a citizen or the Federal agent going to close down a still during Prohibition.
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,422.357,432.581,"The Government contractor cases present a quite distinct set of issues that, of course, is not present in this case because there is no contract between the Federal Trade Commission and Philip Morris."
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.917,470.94,"Do all these contracting cases involve the contractor imposing law upon somebody, executing law?"
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,473.592,475.258,In a couple--
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.258,476.677,Because that's your test.
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,506.379,506.746,--No.
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.179,508.665,Well--
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,508.665,514.017,--a mistake for the Court to either categorically say all Government contractors are in or all Government contractors are out.
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.017,515.335,--But that puts a whole new theory on your--
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,515.335,515.751,"No, it doesn't."
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.751,516.251,--Oh.
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,516.251,529.394,Because my theory is that the person acting under has to be aiding or acting on behalf of a Federal officer in a subordinate relationship in the performance of the officer's official functions.
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.123,550.725,And he was acting under color of law as you've described that in your petitions?
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,551.975,554.01,"That's a different question, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.021,609.113,"Well, I, I it seems to me color of office, you say color of office, it means that its appearance to somebody else is that... that he is being an official."
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,617.536,619.569,And in the Medicare context this happens.
2006.05-1284,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.395,673.001,"How, how do you distinguish your Blue Cross example from the instance where drug companies are doing testing required by the FDA?"
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,673.001,674.617,That's compliance with the regulation.
2006.05-1284,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,683.873,688.26,Blue Cross is different because there they are acting as an intermediary of the Government?
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,688.26,693.496,--They are performing a function at the Government's direction for the Government.
2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,694.348,695.781,"Well, that doesn't seem to be a distinction."
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,708.923,709.423,--No.
2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,782.97,788.04,There's a difference between you are providing products and complying with testing.
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,814.774,825.297,Because it would be transforming a preemption defense into an opportunity to use a Federal officer removal to have a case from State court to Federal court.
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.143,854.982,"Just out of curiosity, what, what happens to the, the employees of the private companies that run prisons?"
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,857.499,859.618,"It depends on the nature of the contract, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.053,866.355,"They either run the prison for a State, or for the Federal Government."
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,866.355,867.474,--What the Court--
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.474,868.507,--or the Federal Government.
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,868.507,877.58,--What the Court would look at is whether there is a ongoing supervisory relationship and whether the Federal officer has the power to transform or alter the conduct.
2006.05-1284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,884.752,888.47,"Well, the prison case, there's not any if about it."
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,914.288,920.09,"Of course, this Court has held that in that context there is not State action in that particular circumstance."
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.782,933.599,Is that the test here?
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,937.501,946.759,"There... that would certainly be a simple way to determine whether a person is acting under a Federal officer, if it meets the entwinement test articulated by this Court in that case."
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.759,948.175,But suppose it doesn't.
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,948.175,948.942,If it doesn't--
2006.05-1284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.942,951.144,Should I conclude it therefore is not covered?
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,951.144,960.417,"--No, I think that the proper standard, Justice Scalia, as I've said, is whether there is a ongoing supervisory relationship and the Government has the power to alter the actor's conduct."
2006.05-1284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,967.422,968.405,I don't follow that.
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,972.974,980.163,But not on a basis that is I think appropriate to understand a subordinate relationship.
2006.05-1284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1015.903,1016.903,Has it been done?
2006.05-1284,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1033.381,1059.098,"Justice Ginsburg, in our cert papers, and we didn't repeat them in our merits papers, we give examples where a window blinds manufacturer, a medical device manufacturer, a whole series of others, a bank, a credit union, have attempted... after the Eighth Circuit's decision in this case have removed cases to Federal court on the grounds that they are Federal officers because they are subjected to far more extensive regulations than Philip Morris."
2006.05-1284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1094.605,1096.321,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1104.061,1107.429,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-1284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.632,1147.59,Do they test their products before they're marketed under rigid Federal testing regulations which are supervised by the Federal Government?
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1147.59,1153.644,"Let me talk about... there are, there are numerous testing requirements."
2006.05-1284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.033,1168.968,Is the Government supervising those?
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1168.968,1173.17,--Is... the Government often says exactly what the test has to be.
2006.05-1284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.17,1182.911,"Yeah, but is there some Government official who's there to make sure that the testing is being done the way, the way it's supposed to be, which is what, what is argued is the case here?"
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1182.911,1187.363,"Well, I... I... I can't say in every case that somebody is there to make sure--"
2006.05-1284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.363,1188.548,They don't have to be there every day.
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1188.548,1190.065,--But... the Government is--
2006.05-1284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1190.065,1190.998,Policing--
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1190.998,1196.802,"--Policing and enforcing the testing requirements, and there's testing in all these areas."
2006.05-1284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1200.171,1201.356,What's... what's your conclusion?
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1203.808,1205.775,"--They are not people acting, because if they--"
2006.05-1284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1205.775,1207.61,--Because policing sounds like--
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1207.61,1210.479,--The Government's policing is enforcing the law.
2006.05-1284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1230.29,1233.975,--What about... what about USDA food inspection?
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1239.712,1240.414,The Government--
2006.05-1284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1240.414,1241.531,But you still get a Government stamp.
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1241.531,1243.466,--You can have different situations.
2006.05-1284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1283.239,1287.459,So if you are a federally certified inspector you are acting under--
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1287.459,1294.779,"Certified as a representative of the FAA, yes, you are."
2006.05-1284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1294.779,1297.915,--What about private transportation of mail?
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1305.504,1321.18,"The standard for contracts is some contracts are in and some contracts are out in our minds, depending on whether the... they are subject to the guidance, supervision, or control of federal officers."
2006.05-1284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.697,1356.583,"--I have a contract to provides food to the Senate cafeteria, okay."
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1381.464,1389.304,"But the problem with that, what you're saying, is the 1948 statute expanded it all Federal officers."
2006.05-1284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1526.273,1528.359,You don't care what kind of testing they do?
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1532.144,1537.381,"--Actually, the Federal Trade Commission cannot require the particular testing method."
2006.05-1284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1553.741,1558.727,"Mr. Gornstein, was there any Government litigation against the cigarette companies?"
2006.05-1284,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1558.727,1570.268,There has been Government litigation against the cigarette companies for allegations that are very similar to the complaint in this case except that it is being brought under the RICO statute.
2006.05-1284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1620.285,1626.355,"--Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1628.122,1631.091,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1674.336,1679.99,Did the FTC ever adopt a regulation saying you've got publish these measurements?
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1679.99,1680.574,No.
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1714.997,1732.791,"But if one of the companies had said, we're sick of doing this, we don't like the numbers we're getting, whatever, we're just not going to do it, presumably if we, you know, accept that testimony at face value, the FTC would have moved and said, okay, I guess we're going to have to have a reg or a statute or what-not."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1738.862,1739.595,"Yes, it would."
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1783.455,1785.307,What is this... I'm just not following it.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1791.627,1796.948,"--The source of the FTC number is the FTC test, alternatively called the Cambridge filter test."
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1796.948,1797.715,"The Cambridge test, yes."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1797.715,1800.733,But the FTC calls it the FTC test.
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1831.934,1832.401,I understand that.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1856.682,1871.376,"It's fairly... what happened, it's fairly clear from what the FTC has said, they would bring an action for deceptive advertising if there was anything involved in the marketing of those cigarettes that had to do with tar and nicotine levels."
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1871.376,1871.792,Okay.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1884.783,1885.733,"No, they wouldn't."
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1889.585,1904.927,All I'm getting at is the FTC had no basis other than a voluntary agreement to require them to publish any numbers or to publish any numbers in accordance with the Cambridge--
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1904.927,1907.796,--The history of that is set forth in the record and it's clear.
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1907.796,1908.096,--Right.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1908.096,1914.083,And the answer is that the FTC announced a proposed rule.
2006.05-1284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.572,1967.463,"Again, you're talking about an agency that has set certain standards that the entity its regulating must meet."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2016.38,2019.063,"Let me see if I can answer that question, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.803,2056.235,They are called FTC ratings?
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2056.235,2056.485,--Yes.
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.485,2064.425,"And they are called... in the regulations it's called the FTC test, even after it has been done by the companies?"
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2064.425,2066.277,"Yes, yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.761,2069.063,"That's very careless, isn't it?"
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2069.063,2070.163,--It's not careless.
2006.05-1284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.496,2105.236,But there must be many times when an agency prescribes a test that a regulated party must comply with.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2125.733,2127.716,"Let me try again, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2162.756,2170.343,"What if in your hypo the Government came along and said, in order to run your hospital, you've got to disclose certain facts."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2181.65,2182.0,--No.
2006.05-1284,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2183.585,2185.602,Why isn't that the situation that we've got here?
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2185.602,2196.308,"The difference, the difference is, is that, A, the test is, is... the FTC and the record is full of this, too; the FTC set a goal for itself very early in the regulatory process."
2006.05-1284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2215.62,2229.261,"I thought that, Mr. Olson, that the cigarette companies wanted to make a light brand so that they could keep customers who might be tempted to quit if there was only the heavy kind."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2238.716,2242.603,"--Well, in, in 29... this is in the record."
2006.05-1284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.676,2293.036,"--Well, any product that the Government supervises, certainly the Government would want to promote a safer... I mean, think of a jet ski."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2371.8,2385.71,"--The Government says that the test is... is, that if an individual, private actor, is assisting the Federal Government in performing the official Government function, the case is appropriate to be removed."
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2402.236,2403.203,Is this right?
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2429.303,2430.739,The apple lookers' device?
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.739,2431.105,No.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2483.29,2491.377,"Ah, but Justice Breyer, what happens here is they say you do it yourself, and the Chairman of the... Chairman of the FTC said why."
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2513.123,2535.053,"That wouldn't be relevant, because the... the problem with the, with the approach that you're taking, as I see it, would be that, that there are probably a lot of instances where a regulated firm, the regulation meaning yes/no, market/not market; yes/no, advertise/not advertise, performs all kinds of tests to see if it is yes or no."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2544.492,2545.758,--But we're... we're not.
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.998,2608.581,All right.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2628.226,2629.295,What I was saying in answer--
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2629.295,2630.862,Is that... have I got that right?
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2630.862,2631.364,--I think so.
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2655.229,2655.629,No.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2674.374,2676.309,The Agency decided they are any--
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2676.309,2678.475,"I, I see the argument now."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2678.475,2678.775,--Yeah.
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.775,2682.463,"Then is there any, any authority ever, that you found for that?"
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2684.646,2689.05,"This is, as the Eighth Circuit said, a very unusual situation."
2006.05-1284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2708.594,2709.829,Well there's one different.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2741.897,2744.433,"Justice, I understand there's a distinction."
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.427,2808.587,"Have, have they imposed its official... has it imposed, the FTC, its official results on any company that was not a participant in this... in this testing lab?"
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2808.587,2809.721,I don't know the answer to that.
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.48,2826.465,Your case would be stronger if they weren't doing it just for themselves.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2832.469,2835.004,--That's the private hospital example that we were talking about.
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.004,2835.288,Yeah.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2835.288,2836.94,I don't know that it would be stronger.
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.04,2840.075,Because here you're doing it for yourself.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2861.656,2871.677,"--Well, that happens to be... there happens to be a coincidence of what the Government wants to accomplish and what the industry is willing to and wants to accomplish."
2006.05-1284,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2886.521,2889.556,"Mr. Olson, you've been talking a lot about testing."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2917.79,2923.694,"Well, in the first place if there's anything in the complaint that allows a removal then the case can be removed."
2006.05-1284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3018.752,3026.408,"But the company is doing it so it can stay in business and market this product, not as a service to the U.S. Government."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3026.408,3034.078,--I don't deny that the... the Respondents in this case are engaged in industry.
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.141,3104.891,"Well that's a good, that's a good preemption argument."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3104.891,3105.926,If the--
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3105.926,3108.962,I'm not sure it has much bearing upon whether--
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3108.962,3112.08,"--Well, it is a good preemption argument, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1284,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3157.359,3173.488,"I know all that's involved here is the forum and removal; but if we were to rule for you that there' is Federal officer status here, would that effect any of the substantive determinations on the preemption question, etcetera?"
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3173.488,3174.738,"No, I don't think so."
2006.05-1284,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3175.121,3177.123,It's just a forum question?
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3177.123,3177.857,"--Yes, it is."
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3186.895,3187.828,I have a quick question.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3192.616,3193.216,--Yes.
2006.05-1284,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3215.065,3218.017,I don't understand your response to Justice Kennedy.
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3232.526,3235.009,"Well, it may perhaps be."
2006.05-1284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3323.953,3327.405,"--It all comes back to me now, that case you mentioned."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3339.36,3343.681,--That is the case.
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3355.905,3359.69,Is it the apple institute who's doing the testing?
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3359.69,3363.725,It's the Tobacco Institute testing facility--
2006.05-1284,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3363.725,3365.677,"No, I said apple institute."
2006.05-1284,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3376.568,3379.218,--It's a facility of the tobacco industry.
2006.05-1284,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3433.119,3435.571,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2006.05-1284,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3438.189,3444.443,"If this is a perfect case for Federal officer removal, there are easily 40,000 others in the State courts waiting to he removed."
2006.05-1284,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3444.443,3454.049,"Well, how many others involve the agency calling the result of the private action the FTC figures and the FTC test?"
2006.05-1284,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3454.049,3460.805,"I don't know the answer to that, but I can tell you that in lots and lots of areas, the Federal Government wants safer, cleaner cars, safer refrigerators--"
2006.05-1284,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3460.805,3465.59,But they don't... they don't put it out to the public as the Federal Government's figures.
2006.05-1284,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3465.59,3466.14,--They do--
2006.05-1284,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3466.14,3466.858,That makes a big difference.
2006.05-1284,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3466.858,3468.358,--It does not make a difference.
2006.05-1284,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3500.53,3502.216,Just don't call it the Government's test.
2006.05-1284,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3505.917,3516.991,"--The description shouldn't make a difference, particularly where it is in a voluntary agreement that was not put out for notice and comment rulemaking, and it was done for precisely this reason, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1284,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3526.431,3528.533,Now the FTC told us why they did it.
2006.05-1284,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3533.085,3543.042,"They also said, Mr. Chief Justice, that they expected the companies to police each other, which is exactly what happened when the Barclay cigarette came up."
2006.05-1284,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3559.916,3560.849,"Thank you, Counsel."
