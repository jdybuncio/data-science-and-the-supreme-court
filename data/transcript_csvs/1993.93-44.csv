1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.048,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-44, the Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,11.039,14.121,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.604,111.695,"Well, Mr. Farr, there is... we have a situation where one medium has a limited number of channels, and does the Government have no interest at all in seeing that those channels are opened up--"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,111.695,113.194,I think the Government--
1993.93-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.194,115.365,"--to others on a neutral basis, for example?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,115.365,135.441,"--Justice O'Connor, I think the Government has an interest in seeing that cable operators like other businesses, including like other members of the press, do not make decisions about what to carry on an anticompetitive basis, and if the law was narrowly directed to that problem, then it seems to me the case would be different, but the law is not."
1993.93-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,135.441,146.237,"For instance, the dissenting judge on the panel below suggested an alternative way that the Government might proceed."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,149.088,164.489,"Justice O'Connor, I don't completely agree with Judge Williams on the idea that least access channels are a less restrictive alternative for two reasons, even though, quite frankly, it is in one sense a helpful argument to us."
1993.93-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.933,196.799,"What if a municipality chose or perhaps, if the Federal Government had the power, the Federal Government chose to say that all cable operators must be merely carriers?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,203.024,204.234,I think it is--
1993.93-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.234,205.516,You have to be like the telephone company.
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,206.956,217.364,"--Although I wouldn't concede it, I suppose it is possible that at one time that is something that could have been considered, but now we have a system with operating cable systems which--"
1993.93-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.364,220.726,But why is that any different from Justice O'Connor's least access proposal?
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,224.977,227.24,"--Well, that's correct, and as I'm saying, I have a difficulty--"
1993.93-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.24,228.64,"--So you think that would be unconstitutional, too."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,228.64,229.922,"--That's correct, I do."
1993.93-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.994,233.632,We do it for telephone companies.
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,234.614,245.701,"--It is not unconstitutional for telephone companies, because they are not essentially engaged in the business of providing news, information, speech of that nature to the public."
1993.93-44,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,245.701,249.744,But does that sort of define the problem in a way that makes it easier for you?
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,265.606,275.821,What... it seems to me that the particular activity that the must-carry law is aimed at is choice of material to be carried on a cable system.
1993.93-44,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.371,317.248,"Of course, the significance of that, in a way, is easy if we use the terms like editorial discretion, which have taken on a meaning from the newspaper context, but this doesn't quite fit the newspaper context."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,339.663,345.385,"Well, it seems to me that 1) the term editorial discretion means a particular thing."
1993.93-44,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,362.799,365.471,"But Mr. Farr, they're not making particular decisions."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,379.369,385.844,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, they are not deciding each moment of the day what is put on a particular channel."
1993.93-44,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,388.365,393.828,I think one of the briefs suggested a better term would be an entrepreneurial decision rather than an editorial--
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,393.828,421.617,"Well, Your Honor, to begin with, the term ""editorial discretion"" is a term that this Court has used in Preferred and other cases with respect to what the cable operators are doing, so I'm not simply creating it out of thin air, but I think it is an entrepreneurial decision in the sense that any member of the media who is choosing speech is choosing it in part, at least, for entrepreneurial reasons."
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.764,438.247,"--But that's essentially an economic decision, not a literary or choice one."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,438.247,440.127,"Well, it's a combination of the two."
1993.93-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.033,515.136,"Well, of course, I guess we can argue about Judge Williams' solution if and when it's ever adopted."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,529.136,529.847,"Well, that's correct."
1993.93-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.847,532.559,So it isn't really the same thing as what's done with the telephone company.
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,532.559,533.52,That is correct.
1993.93-44,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,533.52,542.887,"I think Justice O'Connor's question was whether, in your... based on your argument, least access... least access would be equally unconstitutional."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,550.49,554.874,"I think that is a closer question, and let me explain why."
1993.93-44,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,592.658,614.291,"Can you explain one thing to me, because I think it was the nub of the answer that you just gave, and that is, Judge Williams relied very heavily in his opinion on the fact that the FCC requires certain elements of content in local programming, and therefore a fortiori it is required by must-carry."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,628.212,649.366,"I would not put them specifically on a par, because I think it still is a particular discrimination in favor of identified speakers, and I think it would be illusory, frankly, to assume that Government is not generally aware of what speech on broadcast station consists of."
1993.93-44,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.903,670.799,"But they deal with programming on all broadcast stations, so that your identification of the speaker would be purely geographic at that point, wouldn't it?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,670.799,671.92,--In the sense that--
1993.93-44,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.92,673.58,"I mean, i.e., locally."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,682.335,714.386,"--Well, for example, if I understand the question, Justice Souter, a law that says that a broadcast station cannot have indecent material, let's say, that is a law that applies to broadcast stations throughout the country, so Congress could know that if it's expressing a preference for broadcast stations, that it is therefore at the same time really expressing a preference for stations that are subject to that law and that restriction on their speech in ways that other possible programmers would not be."
1993.93-44,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,714.386,718.16,That would distinguish... I guess this is my point of ignorance.
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,722.363,736.462,"They are not subject to some of the same restrictions on their speech that broadcast stations are, and I think that is because they do not share the physical... the spectrum and the physical scarcity rationale has not been applied to them."
1993.93-44,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,738.122,754.594,"Mr. Farr, if a municipality is reviewing bids for a cable company, and let's assume economically there can probably be only one cable company, I take it it's entitled to assess the cultural offerings of the different programs from the different bidders?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,754.594,763.72,"Well, I am not sure that I would give them much leeway in that regard, quite honestly."
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.009,821.517,"Well, Mr. Farr, let's suppose that a municipality decides, we don't want our telephone poles cluttered with a lot of things, so we're only going to be able to have one cable television within the... and there are three or four applicants."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,828.654,835.575,"Assuming the premise, I think it is possible that there is some very modest leeway for that."
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.575,836.987,"Well, why should it be modest?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,836.987,841.98,"Well, because... first of all because I do quarrel with the premise, quite honestly."
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,842.41,843.672,"Well, accept the premise, though."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,843.672,858.302,"--But I think the premise is important, too, and I mean... I will accept it, but I think the premise is important to it, because the question that one is always asking when one is extending Government leeway to get into content is, why are we allowing Government to do this?"
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,909.865,920.963,"So you say if there are 10 cable companies that apply, and the municipality says, we only want one, the First Amendment says no, you have to take all 10, no matter how cluttered the streets get?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,920.963,928.908,"No, no, I would not suggest that cities have that obligation to allow all-comers to come in."
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.701,931.018,"Yes, but okay, well--"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,931.018,931.89,--had before it in Preferred.
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.89,942.726,"--you have a number of observations around the fringe, but how about the actual situation where you have several applicants, the city says we're only going to take one?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,942.726,958.117,"When the city says that, and there is no absolute requirement that the city has to take one in the sense that it could easily accommodate others, then it seems to me the city's power to discriminate on the basis of content is very limited, if it exists at all."
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.117,970.145,"So 10 applicants, the city says we're only going to take one, the applicants could make out a case that physically with a lot of cluttering you might be able to take three or four, the city can do nothing, it has to take all 10?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,970.145,972.006,"No, no, I'm not saying that it has to take all 10."
1993.93-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,998.722,1008.5,"Mr. Farr, to what extent is the scarcity rationale undercut by current technology?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1017.646,1019.359,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.359,1021.209,--available so there would be no scarcity.
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1030.886,1032.756,"Well, I think it changes part of it."
1993.93-44,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1098.199,1113.781,"But Mr. Farr, what does it do to your argument that many cable companies have, say, only 30-odd channels now, and one of the reasons you say you don't want to be forced to carry is that you then have to give up something."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1129.819,1146.422,"It's possible in the future, Justice Ginsburg, there may be a situation where essentially the ability of all programmers to reach the public through a cable system is essentially not foreclosed by a law like the must-carry law, but I would have a couple of comments."
1993.93-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.038,1200.865,How many--
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1200.865,1201.857,--just in larger numbers.
1993.93-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.857,1207.521,--What is the maximum number of local channels that realistically a cable company might be compelled to carry?
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1207.521,1211.424,I don't have a precise answer to that.
1993.93-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1218.199,1222.21,If there are that many local stations that want to be... that would request access.
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1222.21,1223.532,--That's correct.
1993.93-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.532,1225.062,Because in most markets there wouldn't be that many.
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1225.062,1227.624,That many stations total?
1993.93-44,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1258.625,1271.034,"Based on what we've said so far, I assume that the must-carry provision for public broadcasting is the most vulnerable based on the content argument, is that correct?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1271.034,1287.543,"I think that... certainly there are specific findings, Justice Kennedy, about the public television station's content, although there are still findings of a slightly less specific nature about the commercial stations, so frankly I don't make much distinction between the two."
1993.93-44,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1287.543,1307.557,"Well, if we assume for the moment that it's the most vulnerable, and if we assume also for the moment... there can be a debate about it, but if you assume that that's the most justifiable provision from the standpoint of improving our young people's intellectual life, does that mean there's something wrong with our doctrine?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1307.557,1310.428,"Well, I don't think so."
1993.93-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.916,1375.68,"To the extent that's true, aren't you saying the must-carry rules just... largely just make the cable companies carry what they'd carry anyway?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1375.68,1378.434,"I think that's correct, in a sense, Justice Stevens."
1993.93-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.434,1381.395,So maybe the fight isn't quite as serious as it sounds on the surface.
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1381.395,1383.768,"Well, it's serious in one sense."
1993.93-44,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.113,1428.786,"Mr. Farr, as I understand your argument this morning, you pretty much are saying that even if we accept all the congressional findings, you should prevail on the theory you've been advancing."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1428.786,1441.855,"That would be true, that this law is not tailored to anticompetitive activity, and it is based specifically on discrimination among different programmers, and that itself is enough to make the law invalid."
1993.93-44,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1441.855,1452.162,"What if we agree with you, Congress goes back, drops all the findings about content and the value of local origination, and simply sticks to findings about the threat to competition?"
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1452.162,1470.383,"Well, the problem is, simply making findings about the threat to competition, even if they were better substantiated than these findings, which show that in fact the stations are being carried, they're not being dropped in order to get advertising revenues, more broadcast stations are in fact carried on cable systems now than when there was must-carry."
1993.93-44,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1470.383,1474.356,"Congress just says, look, we want to lock the door before the horse has gone."
1993.93-44,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1474.356,1482.881,But the difficulty that they would not cure by simply going back and simply reenacting the same law with anticompetitive findings is the point that I made precisely at the outset.
1993.93-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.485,1507.598,"Very well, Mr. Farr."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1509.759,1518.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.574,1642.325,"Now, Mr. Days--"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1642.325,1642.675,Yes.
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1642.675,1649.67,--do you acknowledge that to be valid the congressional regulation has to be content-neutral?
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1649.67,1650.79,We do not.
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1657.094,1657.715,Well--
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1657.715,1658.376,We think it's--
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1658.376,1658.947,--Wait a minute.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1662.528,1663.049,--Yes.
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1663.049,1669.273,Do you acknowledge the legal principle that to be valid it must be content-neutral?
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1669.273,1681.16,"I think that if it is not content-neutral then it has to meet a very exacting test that this Court has set out, but our position is that this regulation is not content-based."
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1683.752,1684.823,"Yes, I understand that."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1684.823,1685.134,--on the speaker.
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1685.134,1693.289,I was just trying to ascertain whether you take the position or acknowledge that it must be content-neutral to survive.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1693.289,1694.03,"No, not at all."
1993.93-44,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1699.242,1704.535,"And do you say the same thing about the public broadcast must-carry provision, that that's not content-based?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1704.535,1716.222,"I think the lower court was correct in referring to it as being content-based in a de minimis sense, and this may get to your point, Justice Kennedy, about the doctrine."
1993.93-44,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1770.92,1783.906,"In other words, our doctrine puts you in the position of trying to minimize the content-based aspect of the decision, which might really be its best justification from a cultural standpoint."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1783.906,1825.243,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that's why it was our argument on this particular legislation that the existing tools for evaluating it were really not adequate to the task, and that it was more productive not to look at the so-called content related cases or doctrines, but rather to look at those regulations, or those doctrines that deal with attempting to address market dysfunction and economic scarcity, the inability of speakers to have their messages heard because of control."
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1825.243,1830.406,"General Days, there's one point I wasn't clear on in your presentations in your brief."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1830.406,1830.926,Yes.
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1830.926,1851.821,"Are you saying, based on your argument that minimal scrutiny should apply here, that there really is no difference in the authority of the Government vis-a-vis cable and, on the other hand, radio broadcasting, radio and television broadcasters?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1851.821,1852.653,We are not--
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1852.653,1870.323,"In other words, could the Government, if it wished, have a fairness doctrine, have an equal time doctrine, have a decent speech regulation with respect to cable operators and programmers as it does for radio and television broadcasting?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1870.323,1873.255,"--That is not our position, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1894.57,1907.607,"But the same argument was made, or one much... in the Tornillo case, that Tornillo's only opportunity to have his views heard was if the Miami Herald would publish his letter to the editor."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1907.607,1910.388,"Well, certainly that argument was made."
1993.93-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.316,1933.035,"Well, do you think the case would have come out differently if he could have shown as a matter of fact that there was nothing nearly as adequate as publishing his letter to the editor in the Miami Herald to express his views to the public?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1933.035,1940.169,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that saying that there was nothing quite so adequate is not analogous to this situation."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.846,1965.627,Excuse me.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1997.777,2001.969,"Well, Justice Scalia, certainly that argument can be made."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.971,2026.916,"But my point is, we shouldn't look at this as the voice we're trying to get in is the voice of the over-the-air broadcaster."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2048.051,2060.329,There is the bottleneck insofar as we're talking about Congress' commitment that I just mentioned to the American people to ensure that they were able to get free television service.
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.329,2061.067,That's a different issue.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2066.751,2067.172,That's precisely right.
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.784,2069.612,"It has nothing to do with the content, then?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2069.612,2070.333,That's correct.
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2070.333,2086.696,"Well, that's a difficult argument to make in light of the findings that place such stress on the desirability of public television and local broadcasting and discussing local issues and so forth."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2090.206,2094.981,"Justice O'Connor, it in our view is not difficult."
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2115.215,2128.373,"Well, but Congress went ahead on that basis, then, and set aside a third of a whole medium for the benefit of a favored class of speakers, so it's a little difficult to justify that--"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2128.373,2129.375,"Well, Your Honor--"
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2129.375,2130.734,--on existing doctrine.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2130.734,2141.193,--I think the point is that it's not favoring the broadcast industry in the sense of promoting it plain and simple.
1993.93-44,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2174.465,2190.324,"Yes, but Congress responded... I mean, it seems to me the point of Justice O'Connor's question is, Congress responded by explaining why the content of local programming and educational television programming was more desirable, or was in itself desirable."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2214.62,2221.816,"Justice Souter, certainly there were all kinds of statements and findings, but I think they go to the point of diversity."
1993.93-44,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2229.02,2230.282,"Sure, but whenever--"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2230.282,2233.423,--and we're going to watch to make certain that you do precisely what you expected.
1993.93-44,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2234.532,2243.799,"--But whenever you get a particular content which is not otherwise being broadcast, your justification is always diversity."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2266.584,2290.228,"Yes, it's been suggested that this was perhaps a way in which Congress could control the cable TV industry, but I think this Court's decisions have made very clear that the editorial discretion of even broadcasters is fairly broad, and the FCC and the Congress are restricted in the way they go about regulating that particular part of the media."
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2290.228,2301.167,And you conceded that there are more restrictions on what the legislature could do vis-a-vis the cable... the content of what cable operators could choose to put on?
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2301.167,2319.379,"Certainly, given the record that Congress has compiled up to this point, I don't want to preclude Congress' looking at the issue at a later stage, but I think at this point there's nothing in the record that would justify Congress' extending its regulation to cable in the same way that it regulates the broadcast industry."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2319.379,2332.616,"General Days, is it the Government's position that there is no violation of the First Amendment to discriminate with respect to speakers so long as there is no discrimination with respect to content?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2344.215,2352.97,"No, I don't believe that the Government can silence people, but this is not a situation where cable operators are being silenced."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.023,2360.756,"Well, they're saying the broadcasters have to talk, and that means that these other people who want the same space can't talk."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2360.756,2374.324,"--But Justice Scalia, it's a matter of reasonableness, and whether it's tailored to the particular problem that Congress identified, and it's our position that in this legislation that's what Congress did."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.324,2375.894,"Well, how closely tailored is it?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2387.454,2402.461,"I think what Congress identified was an enormous development in the power of the cable TV industry, and was projecting down the road the extent to which that power would overcome the ability of broadcast TV to reach the 40 percent--"
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2402.461,2403.683,"But it was all prediction, because it hadn't happened."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2420.166,2424.477,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, they're not soley predictions."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.989,2446.111,"Maybe they were very bad stations that people didn't want to watch, which is why the cable systems didn't have them."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2446.111,2459.149,"--Well, that may be the case, but what Congress found was that there was an incentive on the part of cable operators to drop certain stations because of their desire to have greater access to advertising revenue."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2459.149,2477.26,"Well, now... I thought the ratio for a cable station between the money it gets from advertising and the money it gets from the subscribers is 25 to 1, so if by failing to carry this single station they lose 1 subscriber, they have to make up from advertising 25 times--"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2477.26,2502.508,"Justice Scalia, I think that the record reflects that cable operators are carrying network affiliates, but they are dropping some of the independent stations not because they don't have attractiveness to cable viewers, but because of the fact that if they're dropped, then other stations can be brought on, and those basically benefit the cable operators."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2502.508,2503.589,--So that--
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2503.589,2504.42,They're also able to use the--
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.42,2505.141,--Excuse me.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2505.141,2508.643,--They also are able to use that for their own programming.
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.651,2524.712,Maybe Congress should pass a law against that.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2524.712,2526.542,"Well, it's certainly trying--"
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.542,2527.834,Instead of saying who can speak and who can't speak.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2527.834,2531.497,"--Well, it's not a matter of telling people who can't speak and who can speak."
1993.93-44,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2546.618,2563.557,"But in the present day context, if the networks are being carried, the network affiliates, then what we're talking about is replacing marginally successful broadcast stations against marginally successful cable offerings."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2564.887,2566.649,"I don't believe it is, Your Honor."
1993.93-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.951,2601.101,"Are there findings to that effect, to the effect that you just described--"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2601.101,2602.163,Yes.
1993.93-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.282,2604.063,--by Congress?
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2604.063,2605.976,--Mr. Chief Justice.
1993.93-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2640.118,2657.679,"And there is a finding by Congress that the result of this is to put owned subsidiaries, owned cables on at the expense of a broadcast station even though the broadcast station might be preferred by more people?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2657.679,2675.791,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, there's a finding in the act at 2(a)(15) discussing the incentives on the part of cable operators to drop commercial and noncommercial stations."
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2677.983,2695.583,"Incentive, but the experience... Mr. Farr gave some figures about how little had in fact been dropped, and you're not disputing the accuracy of his figures?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2698.976,2699.667,--Yes.
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.667,2704.05,But it's not an impressive record of what's been dropped so far.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2704.05,2728.945,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't know about the word impressive, but I think that what it was for Congress was an indication of a problem that ought to be dealt with now, rather than waiting until devastation was wrought upon the broadcast industry and companies were either going dark or had so reduced the quality of their programming that they were not legitimate competitors."
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2728.945,2732.839,So even though there was no clear and present danger of anything like that from the signals that had happened.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2732.839,2739.403,"Well, I don't think that's the standard, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, in this situation, insofar as Congress is concerned."
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2759.285,2776.206,"Well, even more currently, does the record reflect any findings to the anticipated effect of this new satellite service that will go on line within a year that will make virtually unlimited access to people?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2776.206,2780.38,"Your Honor, Justice O'Connor, I don't have any information to that effect."
1993.93-44,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2815.953,2819.764,But that's more like the telephone industry.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2832.423,2846.982,"It is a different proposition, but I think it goes to the issues here in the sense that 1) we have... in talking about the burden on cable operators, 1) if they're indeed carrying most of the stations that would be subject to must-carry, there's not a burden."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.164,2894.734,"Well, this is, it seems to me, very blunderbuss if you're worried about broad... I gather what underlies all of this supposedly is that Congress is worried about some broadcasters not being able to make it, and therefore going out of business, right?"
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2894.734,2895.906,"Justice Scalia, I--"
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.906,2904.211,"And in order to protect against that, cable systems are required to carry even the richest broadcasters, many of whom make millions of dollars a year."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2918.86,2921.001,"--Well, Justice Scalia, Congress has tried to respond to that."
1993.93-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.045,2943.975,I don't see how that narrows the focus.
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2954.354,2959.687,"Well, just as an aside, I'm not sure that that's working very well, but again, let's put this in context."
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3010.099,3010.93,General Days--
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3010.93,3011.231,Yes.
1993.93-44,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3011.231,3016.764,"--before you conclude, can you focus attention on the programmer, not the operator."
1993.93-44,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3021.657,3031.063,"There are several answers: 1) the cable operators, or the cable programmers do have other outlets."
1993.93-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.418,3193.83,"Thank you, General Days."
1993.93-44,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3195.951,3197.701,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-44,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3376.299,3377.629,You agree it's not viewpoint discriminatory.
1993.93-44,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3377.629,3378.82,It's not viewpoint discriminatory.
1993.93-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3379.992,3381.224,"Thank you, Mr. Farr."
