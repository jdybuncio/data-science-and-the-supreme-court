2014.13-7451,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.32,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 13-7451, Yates v. United States."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,8.254,11.639,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,79.616,99.345,"Why should -- why should the expression “ tangible object ”, which stands alone, it's not falsifying documents, why should the word “ object ” in 1519 be treated differently than the word “ other object ” in 1512 -- 1512(c)?"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,99.345,107.016,"Justice Ginsburg, in Section 1519 -- it was passed at the same time as 1512(c) as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act."
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,117.406,121.526,So you think there's a difference between “ tangible object ” and “ other object ”?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,121.526,122.36,"Yes, there is."
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,148.777,158.233,"But how does the Internet -- you could falsify Internet entries, or things that are in the cloud, those are intangible items."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,158.233,164.47,"--No, those are tangible items, Your Honor, because they are stored on a hard drive somewhere."
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,175.595,182.249,Suppose the typewriter were used to prepare an incriminating document.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,185.301,187.235,The typewriter would not be.
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,195.508,215.572,"I -- I understand the argument and the argument that you make has considerable force about over criminalizing, but it seems to me that the test you suggest has almost more problems with vagueness, more problems with determining what its boundaries are than the government's test."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,215.572,221.074,"No, the government's test renders 1512(c) wholly superfluous."
2014.13-7451,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,243.489,248.293,"Well, if that's the -- if that is the case, then why is it not surplusage?"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,257.732,264.569,"An iPad, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, an iPhone."
2014.13-7451,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,265.588,276.226,"Those things in themselves don't -- they have documents, they have something that could be called a document or a record stored in them."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,276.226,276.81,--That is--
2014.13-7451,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,276.81,285.166,"If you -- if you have an iPad that's straight from the store, has nothing -- has no information stored in that, do you think that would fall within the statute?"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,285.166,300.259,--It would fall within the statute because what Congress was trying to intend to do -- and given the backdrop of the Enron situation where massive servers were destroyed or deleted or otherwise -- they were trying to -- to capture the devices that held information.
2014.13-7451,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,308.948,313.501,What about destroying a brand new empty filing cabinet?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,313.501,316.953,That is not a device that's used to preserve information.
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.941,364.451,"But then the Congress could have said used -- tangible object used to preserve information, and then your case would be solid."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,368.07,373.207,"--It said “ tangible object ”, that is true, Justice Ginsburg, that it said “ tangible object ”."
2014.13-7451,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,386.032,393.12,"But could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question, because, my fault I'm sure, but I wasn't sure I understood your answer."
2014.13-7451,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.149,440.351,Generis.
2014.13-7451,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,440.351,442.001,Good.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,457.63,477.357,"--It is, to answer your question, they're being treated differently not simply because of the inclusion of the word “ tangible ”, but because of the other words surrounding “ tangible object ”, like the unique phrase “ makes a false entry in ”, which is not included in any other obstruction of justice statute."
2014.13-7451,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,477.357,491.117,"But just because Congress includes more verbs -- I mean, the reason Congress includes 20 verbs instead of 4 is presumably because Congress really wants to sweep in a very wide variety of conduct."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,498.288,505.361,"Although this Court has never held that all the verbs, you know, applied to all the nouns, it would make sense that they would apply."
2014.13-7451,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,531.761,540.217,So your whole argument here really comes down to the fact that Congress put some record-related verbs in there?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,540.217,541.234,"It does not, Your Honor."
2014.13-7451,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,567.701,568.251,But I would think -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,593.501,607.676,"It -- it does not, Your Honor, because if you take the lens and you zoom it out a little bit further, if we look at Section 802 of Title VIII of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it's entitled “ Criminal Penalties For Altering Documents ”."
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.315,648.169,Then how do you -- how do you respond to the illustration that the government gave in its brief?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,668.317,675.071,Congress did not intend 1519 to be applied in that situation.
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.842,691.082,But you think it could -- would -- let me back up and ask what I assume was -- you would say yes to.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,705.29,707.792,"That does, because that is record related."
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,723.886,726.838,Where did the -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-7451,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,726.838,730.723,What if the knife had the defendant's name on it?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,735.358,736.527,--It is not.
2014.13-7451,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,748.601,753.738,"Well, but presumably the same would be true of a lot of documents or records that are destroyed."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,753.738,760.492,"But in ordinary parlance, one would not consider an inscription on a knife to be it."
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,775.002,778.371,"Now, what do you say about 1512(c)?"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,780.989,787.492,"1519 and 12(c), it would make more sense that the knife fall in, and here's why."
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,789.344,793.896,"Even if the knife was used in the murder, but it was destroyed before anybody was caught?"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,793.896,806.204,"--It would -- it would -- if it was destroyed with the intent to impair that object's availability in an official proceeding, which is a classic, classic obstruction statute--"
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,806.204,808.906,So did the government mischarge here?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,812.358,817.012,"--It's possible the government could have charged that particular thing, but--"
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.012,818.431,"I love those words, “ possible ”."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,818.431,819.448,--It is possible.
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,819.931,823.0,What would -- what would have been your defense if they did?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,823.0,829.653,"My defense would have been something very significant, difference between 1512(c) and 1519."
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,831.855,832.938,I know you were charged with.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,834.99,836.142,--He didn't corruptly do it.
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,859.606,863.977,--Destroyed and substituting fish is not a corrupt act.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,863.977,866.428,--It would have been my defense.
2014.13-7451,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,867.479,869.963,Touche.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,869.963,872.848,"Which was the question, Your Honor."
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,905.82,913.475,"And what is your view, given what you've just said, of the best way to narrow this statute?"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,913.475,930.604,"The best way to narrow this statute, Justice Breyer, is to interpret “ tangible object ” in the company it keeps, and that is a device that is designed to preserve information such that if that device is destroyed, the information contained on that device is destroyed."
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.604,953.884,"You still have the problem of the language of the statute covering the destruction of a document such as an EPA questionnaire that comes to the door asking about recycling, where you know that the EPA would like to have that back to help them do their official work of finding out how the program works."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,964.942,965.742,"Well, it--"
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.742,967.21,It surely does within the language.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,967.21,968.01,--It falls within--
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.01,971.362,And your effort to narrow the statute has nothing to do with that.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,971.362,975.466,--The narrowing is the document itself.
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.6,1009.971,"But my problem, of course, is reading the statute and taking your argument in the context that you mean it, which is we must look for a way to narrow this statute, which at first blush seems far broader than any witness-tampering statute, any obstruction of justice statute, any not lying to an FBI agent statute that I've ever seen, let alone those within Section 15."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1015.791,1030.969,"--Focusing on your problem, Justice Breyer, I would say that it is not an onerous situation for individuals to retain documents."
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.59,1039.773,Right.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1040.023,1040.79,--of documents.
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1040.79,1042.09,I see where you're going.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1057.718,1058.402,Uh-huh.
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.402,1061.269,And perhaps it's nothing more than trying to find out information.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1078.981,1084.802,"Well, I would accept the invitation that it would be void for vagueness, Your Honor."
2014.13-7451,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.802,1086.585,Why is it vague?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1089.62,1089.92,It -- it--
2014.13-7451,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.92,1100.995,"What is vague about the fact that if you destroy a questionnaire, you destroy a document with the intent of, what is it, to impede, obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration."
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1102.378,1106.065,"The answer to that, if you want to pose it as a question to me ----"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1153.462,1154.512,"--Well, I agree with that."
2014.13-7451,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.512,1155.179,All right.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1156.748,1185.684,"The answer -- the answer would be that perhaps a way to reconcile this statute would be not only to accept our position that it relates to recordkeeping generally, but that it requires specifically, relates to business recordkeeping, where businesses are on notice such as SEC filing quarterly requirements or otherwise, that they are to do specific things."
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1197.491,1202.543,Isn't -- isn't running a fishing vessel a business?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1202.543,1205.511,"It would be running a business, Your Honor, it would be."
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1216.036,1221.107,Can you -- can you tell me the exact consequences for your client?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1228.027,1228.577,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1228.577,1235.966,And he could have gotten the same sentence?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1235.966,1236.649,No.
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1249.957,1251.457,But he in fact got what?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1254.259,1259.996,30 -- he ended up getting 30 days by a judge that made that individualized decision under the Booker factors.
2014.13-7451,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.717,1269.186,But you're only arguing for your client.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1271.553,1276.122,"--No, Your Honor, this is just related to Mr. Yates."
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.851,1325.705,"Suppose the fisherman took pictures of the fish, and then he destroyed both the pictures and the fish."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1327.557,1328.557,A picture?
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1356.576,1358.043,The photograph isn't?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1358.043,1362.897,"The photo -- I'm sorry, the photograph is not a tangible object under our definition."
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1368.384,1369.217,Is a piece of paper a physical object?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1369.217,1374.538,"A piece of paper is a piece of paper, a physical object."
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.538,1375.238,Is it an object?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1375.238,1376.723,It's an object as well.
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1376.723,1384.394,"But why isn't a film if it's on it -- I'm talking not about a film on one of these screens, but an old-time film that you can pick up."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1386.779,1390.565,"Well, they -- it is -- the film itself is a record."
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1393.782,1396.301,Would its destruction be a violation of this Act?
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1396.301,1397.22,"--Yes, it would be."
2014.13-7451,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.22,1405.907,"It seems very odd that you can throw away the fish without violating the Act, but you can't throw away the picture."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1405.907,1414.68,"Although it's not what Congress intended, it's what requires that this statute read even under our interpretation, which brings up the absurdity of this particular case."
2014.13-7451,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1431.458,1432.643,"Well, then why is that absurd?"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1445.384,1454.323,"The -- the absurdity aspect comes down to the -- perhaps the prosecution in this case, and I didn't mean to overstate that, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-7451,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.166,1471.533,"Wouldn't it be just as absurd to give him 20 years, though, wouldn't it?"
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1471.533,1473.718,"--It would be extremely absurd, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-7451,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.718,1474.184,Yes.
2014.13-7451,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1474.618,1476.336,But that clearly falls within the statute.
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1479.071,1480.671,The only -- the only way we could argue--
2014.13-7451,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1480.671,1492.029,"--You know, it seems as though this is -- Congress gives very strict penalties to lots of minor things, and -- but that's, you know, that's what it does."
2014.13-7451,0,56115,john_l_badalamenti,,1492.029,1501.219,"--Congress did something that was very, very strong language to the American people in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act."
2014.13-7451,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.788,1557.488,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-7451,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1569.365,1571.681,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"

2014.13-7451,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2521.296,2524.281,He said it has a stronger state of mind element.

2014.13-7451,1,56052,roman_martinez,,2652.564,2655.433,I think -- I think it's true that the term “ tangible ” is different.
