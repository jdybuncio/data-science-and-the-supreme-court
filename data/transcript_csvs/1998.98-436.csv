1998.98-436,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.437,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-436, John Alden v. Maine."
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,8.689,16.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-436,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.539,177.431,"Howlett was not a suit against a State, was it, Mr. Gold?"
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,177.431,177.692,--No.
1998.98-436,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.737,250.809,"Well, how... how is that so?"
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,265.669,298.511,"--There... if Congress cannot provide for private party State court enforcement of this law, given the Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence which also closes the Federal courts to such proceedings--"
1998.98-436,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.511,307.827,"Well, but I suppose that a private person could still sue a State officer under an Ex parte Young type approach."
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,307.827,351.285,"--That could be done, but it would not be a suit for back pay for the money due and owing, and therefore what you have is if State sovereign immunity is an absolute check on the sovereign powers of Congress, then there can be no private party enforcement of a valid, binding Federal enactment."
1998.98-436,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.285,351.336,But I--
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.336,370.779,"--So that the private party can prevent any future violation of the Federal law, and I assume the United States, if it... if it wished, if the statute were framed that way, could sue on behalf of the people who had been deprived previously of what they were entitled to under the Federal law."
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,370.779,386.948,"Yes, and the... the State does concede that, and indeed as this Court has made clear, so that we're not overstating anything, the suit by the United States could be in Federal court as well as in State court."
1998.98-436,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.078,419.382,"Well, it is a constitutional principle."
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,487.314,528.922,"Well, if... if I can, Justice Kennedy, it seems to me that what we see with regard to the original understanding is two points, and I don't think they lead to the conclusion that there is some implicit constitutional limit on Congress' sovereign authority that runs in favor... that limits Congress in its sovereign power and runs in favor of the States as to a matter where the State isn't sovereign."
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.942,615.369,"But, you know, you say it's an extraordinary notion, but the whole... the whole system of... of dual sovereignty and dual citizenship was an extraordinary notion."
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,616.999,663.811,"Right, but... and as the Eleventh Amendment shows, in making adjustments to deal with the new aspects of that extraordinary situation, there was what I think would have to be seen as an entirely new concept adjusted to the situation to preserve a form of... or to create a form of State sovereign immunity which would not have obtained by simple extrapolation from the law of nations."
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.581,666.642,"That... that... well, but--"
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,666.642,667.211,And--
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.211,679.47,"--As Justice Kennedy pointed out, the Eleventh Amendment... our case law has said... and I understand there's some argument about it, but... but it's... it's the law here that it's just confirmatory of... of sovereign immunity that existed."
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,718.425,738.818,"--Well, as time evolves and we understand more about what's needed, I would argue to you that that kind of judgment is precisely the kind of judgment that Congress makes, what is proper enforcement, unless there is--"
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.818,740.09,Not if hangs on sovereign immunity.
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,741.42,741.82,"--Well, no."
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.82,743.961,--what the States will do with their sovereign immunity.
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,743.961,762.845,"But a sovereign immunity concept which goes beyond any concept that was understood at the time... after all, sovereign immunity as an attribute of sovereignty is vouchsafe to the States in State court."
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.025,813.899,"Well, of course... of course, there isn't because there's never been a creature like this, and the argument proves too much."
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,822.367,822.607,--No.
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.607,827.99,--since the Federal Government has... has taken over legislative jurisdiction from the State and--
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,827.99,828.659,No.
1998.98-436,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.659,830.251,--and excluded the State from those areas.
1998.98-436,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,832.642,876.139,"The... first of all, for sovereign immunity, it has to be a suit against the State on a Federal law which is valid within the State sovereignty constraints on Federal law, and nothing we say here goes to the special case of the Eleventh Amendment, which is, as this Court has been careful to state, a restriction on the Federal judicial power borne of particular concerns about the Federal judicial power, not a constraint on the sovereign legislative power."
1998.98-436,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.538,953.02,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,954.612,962.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.981,1064.826,"Well, General Waxman, would you agree that there is no case from our Court that squarely decides the issue before us now?"
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1064.826,1068.099,I would agree that no case squarely decides it.
1998.98-436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1080.816,1083.189,Howlett didn't involve a State.
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1083.189,1084.088,No.
1998.98-436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.477,1124.325,"By... by analogy we've held that under the Eleventh Amendment, counties, Luning against New Mexico, don't participate of the... of the Eleventh Amendment immunity."
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1137.594,1138.735,"--Well, it may be."
1998.98-436,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1286.892,1294.606,"Well, the Hilton court respected stare decisis in part, the reasoning of which has been totally undercut by our later cases."
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1294.606,1310.848,"Well, what I think... I think it's... it's quite significant, Mr. Chief Justice, that the way this Court concluded its opinion in Howlett was to say, quote, that when a Federal statute does impose liability upon the States... I'm sorry."
1998.98-436,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1358.567,1365.773,I... I think we... we can take for purposes of argument here there's little doubt that Congress can pass this... this statute.
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1381.234,1387.349,"Well, I think the answer to the question of whether Congress could prescribe any conceivable remedy is no."
1998.98-436,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1393.93,1400.194,"Well, and it's limited by cases such as New York in which we say you can't command the State to do something directly."
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1400.194,1401.276,--Exactly right.
1998.98-436,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1452.68,1462.735,"But if this... if this cause of action is... is so important that we must set aside the State's immunity in its own court, why isn't it important enough that the Government itself could have brought the suit?"
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1462.735,1469.41,"Well, the Government... the Government could bring a suit, and we could have a regime which seems to me to run--"
1998.98-436,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.41,1470.181,May I interrupt with a question?
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1483.529,1491.904,"--Well, I suppose the reason is that, you know, the Federal Government, as the super sovereign, can abrogate a sovereign immunity--"
1998.98-436,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1491.904,1493.797,"Well, you can sue in your own court."
1998.98-436,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1493.797,1494.718,--In Federal court.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1746.984,1751.866,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.535,1766.208,"I don't need compelling evidence, just... just a little preponderance is all--"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1770.089,1788.08,"--Justice Scalia, the... this Court in the Blatchford said... made clear that it's incumbent upon those who are... who are seeking to abrogate the immunity that there be compelling evidence that arises from the Convention or from the text of the Constitution that the States gave up their immunity."
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1790.241,1790.882,Mr. Brann--
1998.98-436,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1790.882,1793.704,"--But you don't rely on the text of the Constitution at all, do you?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1793.704,1795.526,The structure of the Constitution--
1998.98-436,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1795.526,1797.357,The structure is what your entire argument is.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1797.357,1798.869,--in which we have enumerated powers--
1998.98-436,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1798.869,1799.227,I understand.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1799.227,1800.609,--given to the Federal Government--
1998.98-436,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1800.609,1801.67,But you don't have anything in the text is what I'm saying.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1801.67,1813.8,"--Well, except that the text of the Constitution confirmed through the Tenth Amendment... and we think this case is fundamentally a Tenth Amendment case as well... is that we have a Federal Government of limited enumerated powers."
1998.98-436,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1821.072,1828.528,"Now, do I understand correctly that you would agree that the United States could not bring this action on behalf of these employees in the State court?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1828.528,1830.168,We... that is our position.
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.139,1833.661,How is it then they can bring it in the Federal court?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1833.661,1851.573,"--The... we submit that one of the things that in the Plan of the Convention that States gave up was that... was the ability of a Federal... Federal Government to enforce Federal law in Federal court, dating back to the United States v. Texas case of over 100 years ago, that one of the things that's necessary in order--"
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.573,1854.204,Is there anything in the history of the Convention that explains that?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1856.655,1858.366,--The way in which this Court--
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.366,1860.799,I think the Convention is equally silent on that point.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1860.799,1881.751,"--Except that the... this Court in United States v. Texas took the position... was that the State consented by virtue of the Supremacy Clause in granting the power... certain powers to the Federal Government, that what came with that was the fact that the Federal Government, not a private individual, but a Federal Government could enforce the Federal statutes."
1998.98-436,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1881.751,1883.033,"Well, then the Federal courts--"
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.033,1885.716,--How do you get... get that limit in there just from the structure?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1888.329,1889.118,We think--
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.118,1890.6,It's a peculiar limitation.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1901.677,1903.089,"--I do, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-436,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1923.02,1928.745,"Mr. Brann, how... how would it work in a case where it's not... you brought up the Tenth Amendment."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1959.254,1971.591,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think that that actually illustrates the limits on which we are... of our argument is that in copyright and patent what we have is exclusive jurisdiction that is placed in the Federal courts."
1998.98-436,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1985.992,1988.363,But it wouldn't be the United States that's suing in those cases.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,1993.546,2002.552,"--And in those cases, that is true because the... but that... the problem in that case is already posed as a result of Seminole Tribe because of the layer in which--"
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.552,2015.181,Are you saying that the Government could not pass a statute which said that the Federal Government may... may sue on behalf of any individual whose copyright has been violated?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2015.181,2015.91,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.125,2024.338,"Well, so it could... right, but it could be remedied, as far as the theory of your case is concerned, by a statutory amendment."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2024.338,2027.499,"Under our constitutional construct, that's entirely correct, is that--"
1998.98-436,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2027.499,2048.333,"Did I misunderstand you to say that under your current theory, that there would be room... although there's no room for this lawsuit in State court, there would be room in Federal court for a private party to sue the State in an area where the Federal court... where the Federal legislature has exclusive legislative authority?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2049.382,2051.225,"--If I did, I misspoke."
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2068.876,2071.757,May I go back to your... your colloquy with Justice Stevens?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2082.284,2102.567,"--We believe that under the Plan of the Convention, what this Court referred to in... in the United States v. Texas case as consent... one of the things that we consented to when we ratified the Constitution was... as General Waxman alluded to, was a super sovereign and a super sovereign's ability to enforce its statutes, if they are otherwise valid and under Garcia--"
1998.98-436,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.567,2112.234,"Well, didn't... didn't our Court hold in United States against California back in the '30's or '40's that the Federal Government could sue a State in... in Federal court?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2112.234,2112.925,--Yes.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2115.636,2141.243,"Well, but if the... if the United States can sue in a Federal court and it can do so because that basically was implicit in the Plan of the Convention and the Eleventh Amendment supposedly reflects that, then why was it not... why was the same implication not present, that when the National Government is enforcing... seeking to enforce a valid Federal law, it could sue in a State court?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2147.126,2152.129,"As I say, the... the question is difficult to answer simply because it's never really arisen."
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2154.322,2165.87,"It probably don't... it probably won't either, so why are you fighting it?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2169.753,2180.051,We think that the States... one of the key aspects of sovereignty is the ability to create one's own courts and to ascribe them with their jurisdiction.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2203.687,2207.467,"Well, it wouldn't if perhaps... if you didn't have the Supremacy Clause."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2253.518,2255.99,Because we think that the--
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2255.99,2257.272,And who may enforce it?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2257.272,2262.375,--There... because of the limits of federalism placed on Congress in passing a statute--
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2262.375,2262.555,Where?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2264.135,2276.292,--The limits are found in... in the structure of the Constitution and that we look to was... one of the things that the States gave up when the power to regulate commerce among the States... did that also include abrogation of sovereign immunity?
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2276.292,2282.778,But your point is the structure of the Constitution precludes Congress from enacting a law that would deprive the State of sovereign immunity.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2294.195,2305.963,"We... we would beg to different, Your Honor... is that we think that there is a fundamental difference between when the United States as a sovereign is filing suit than when a private individual is filing suit."
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.963,2314.807,"Even though the suit is filed on behalf of 10 individuals, it seeks precisely the same remedy and damages on behalf of the individuals as if the individuals sued for themselves."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2314.807,2319.152,"But in those circumstances, the United States is still acting as a sovereign."
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.243,2325.824,It was acting as a sovereign when it passed the statute authorizing the suit to be brought by the individuals.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2331.348,2334.012,"--No, that's... that's not... that's not our argument."
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.955,2342.627,And you're saying you did not give up sovereign immunity.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2342.627,2343.757,--We give up... we did not give up the right--
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.757,2345.179,Except in certain circumstances.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2345.179,2351.463,--We did give up the right of a private individual to file a damages action against the State.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.463,2357.277,But you did give up the right to control the law that will be enforced in your own courts.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2357.277,2360.028,If this... if the law is otherwise valid.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2360.028,2366.523,"Yes, if it's... if it's a valid exercise of Congress' power under Article I, you gave up that right."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2366.523,2367.162,We did.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2367.162,2383.554,"And... and isn't the... the question of... of which party enforces the right, whether it be the National Government or... or a private individual subject to the law's benefit, secondary to the basic jurisdictional question whether the National Government can make the operative law?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2383.554,2385.274,No.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2411.941,2414.833,"Oh, I can... I'll grant you that you have conceded that."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2489.191,2497.096,--Let me take my best attempt to provide that theory... is that we granted to Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several States.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2519.883,2527.036,And it seems to me that the answer to that question turns on what the commerce power today includes.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2565.522,2567.722,"But, Your Honor, I think--"
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.722,2568.984,I thought we've held the contrary.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2570.025,2570.396,--I'm sorry?
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.396,2571.916,I thought we've held the contrary.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2571.916,2573.937,I was about to say that--
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2575.319,2577.35,Here's your chance.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2577.54,2588.108,"That argument, however, is precisely the argument that I think did not carry the day in Seminole Tribe in the sense that Congress' substantive--"
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2588.108,2607.329,"Well, Seminole... Seminole Tribe was a case about the Article III judicial power, and if Seminole Tribe had turned simply on a theory of sovereign immunity, one thing is clear beyond any doubt, there was no theory of sovereign immunity in the 18th century that included an exception for the United States."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2626.681,2638.649,"--The point that I was deriving from Seminole Tribe, Your Honor, was the following, which was that Congress' substantive powers under the Commerce Clause, which certainly have expanded, as we look in the late 20th century--"
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2638.649,2639.229,"--Well, commerce has."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2639.229,2646.326,"--is not the same as whether... as Congress' power to abrogate, that they are two separate issues and need to be analyzed separately."
1998.98-436,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2672.381,2691.226,"Well, and insofar as there is a perceived incongruity in your concession that the United States can sue, really the Constitution is quite specific that one State can sue another State, and so it surely follows that the United States can sue a State."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2697.738,2698.429,--And in--
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.429,2702.522,Do you concede that another State could sue Maine in Maine's court if Maine objected?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2702.522,2703.631,--No.
1998.98-436,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.631,2704.703,"No, I didn't think so."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2704.703,2704.923,No.
1998.98-436,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2705.264,2708.616,But... but it's very clear that they could sue in Federal courts.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2709.525,2712.807,That is... we agree entirely with the point Justice--
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2712.807,2722.935,Which suggests... which suggests that Article I's analysis is somehow quite fundamentally different from Article III's analysis even if we accept the premise of Seminole.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2723.366,2738.486,"--Except that when the debate over the... whether or not Article III created a forum in which you could abrogate sovereign immunity... and we have from the statements quoted in the briefs from Hamilton and the... and the other Framers, that it's inconceivable that that could happen."
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2740.406,2746.029,"Well, and... and Hamilton... you're quite right, but Hamilton was also talking about a debate over Article III, wasn't he?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2746.029,2780.391,"--And the... but the debate over Article III only becomes critical at the moment that... if you start with the premise that you couldn't file suit in the State courts which, as we recall, were going to constitute the vast majority of the courts that existed... and so the fact that there is no one, federalist or anti federalist, as Justice Kennedy alluded to, ever suggesting that one of the consequences of a... of a... of ratifying the Constitution is giving up that sovereign immunity in the State's own courts we would submit is... is fairly compelling evidence if that... that did not occur."
1998.98-436,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2780.391,2796.653,"If we could go back to the... get down from the lofty Madisonian plane to the practical implications of what you're saying, I think you told me already that a private individual could not sue the State for a copyright infringement or a trademark infringement."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2807.288,2812.304,Those cases would have to be analyzed on... on their own terms.
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.681,2827.702,--I guess you can always ask a question like that where sovereign immunity is at issue.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2831.625,2833.168,--That is certainly--
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.168,2835.959,Some people think sovereign immunity shouldn't exist for that very reason.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2835.959,2837.369,"--Well, that's not our view."
1998.98-436,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2837.369,2838.34,Is your... is that your answer now?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2854.011,2866.167,"We would submit not, first, because it's important to keep in mind that there is also the Ex parte Young injunctive actions, and we also have the circumstances where we consent."
1998.98-436,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2866.167,2871.182,"Let me... let me home in on money suits, not injunctive suits."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2883.52,2890.363,"If those are... if those statutes are passed and the sole source of that is under the Commerce Clause, then the answer to that is yes."
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.363,2897.609,"So, imagine if you were Rufus King or Charles Pinckney or someone who... I think one represented Maine."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2928.037,2931.049,"Justice Breyer, I think--"
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2931.049,2939.825,"Well, I mean, Congress can... we're assuming Congress could abrogate, say, any extra protection that... that was important to Massachusetts, so it wrote it into its constitution."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,2946.601,2949.122,--If I follow... if I follow--
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2949.122,2950.454,"I mean, an otherwise... all right."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3019.967,3020.578,--The dividing--
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3020.578,3023.08,--I'm going on the idea of the lesser includes the greater.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3041.453,3044.656,--But it wasn't a minor issue in the Constitutional Convention.
1998.98-436,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3052.89,3070.671,"You... Mr. Brann, you don't challenge the authority of the Federal Government to provide that Federal laws can be... lawsuits can be brought in State courts against presumably a railroad that's operating in Maine or some polluter that's... you say it just can't be brought against the State itself."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3070.671,3071.232,Correct.
1998.98-436,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3073.042,3078.128,And I suppose you also concede that a State can waive sovereign immunity.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3078.128,3079.137,--Certainly.
1998.98-436,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3079.137,3095.518,And I suppose you also concede that States often do waive sovereign immunity for suits in their own courts when Congress passes some kind of economic incentive for them to participate in the program and to waive sovereign immunity.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3095.518,3096.247,And indeed--
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3096.247,3096.657,"Well, I mean--"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3096.657,3099.131,--we waive it in numerous circumstances as well.
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.131,3101.883,--Let me be straightforward about what's bothering me.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3132.265,3143.842,"But there are other factors that can be brought to bear in the... in those circumstances in that... in that you have, in addition to... in dealing with the Federal Government, there are obviously various political aspects of it as well."
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3186.63,3191.535,But isn't that true because no one suggested at the time that statutes of this sort would ever be passed?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3233.483,3234.361,And that is true.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3245.08,3252.884,"Did... you might just as well ask the question, did the power to regulate commerce among the States, including subjecting the States to the Fair Labor Standards Act?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3270.946,3271.377,We think--
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3271.377,3272.236,--about enforcement.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3290.919,3307.709,"--But, Justice Souter, I think, though, taken... and we agree with the... the precise example that you're using, the Revolutionary War debts... is that there was no one who suggested that Congress could pass a statute that would then make it possible to collect those debts which were very... the fact that... and the fact that no one every suggested that--"
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3307.709,3309.451,"Right, but to the extent that that--"
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3309.451,3311.712,--What did Hans v. Louisiana say about this subject?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3311.712,3312.634,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-436,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.634,3316.826,What did Hans v. Louisiana suggest about this subject?
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3328.302,3329.003,No.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3332.415,3336.449,Then you're... then it seems to me you're back with the original problem of coherence.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3359.384,3362.647,"Well, we don't think that we're having to have it both ways."
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3372.363,3385.271,"Where did they think... where did they think... to start... to end with the beginning question, where did the people at that time think that if Congress were to pass a legitimate law that bound a State government to pay some money to some people... where would have a law like that have been enforced?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3390.283,3394.046,--I think it's significant that no one suggested that they could pass such a law is the--
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3394.046,3395.848,You're saying they couldn't pass the law.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3396.109,3405.893,"--Well, but that... or that no one suggested that one of the things that Congress could do, in order to address this issue of the Revolutionary War debts, was pass a law that would then be enforceable."
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3405.893,3409.476,"--But if they thought they could pass the law, they would have said you can't enforce it."
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3409.476,3411.897,It may very well be.
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3430.27,3433.012,"So, there is no evidence in the debate or is there?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3433.693,3433.853,--No.
1998.98-436,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3460.16,3474.94,"So, if there is no evidence at all about what the Framers thought would happen to enforce a law that Congress passed to bind the States, how could we know now that given the later... the greater, they wouldn't have conceded the lesser?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3474.94,3486.428,Because the... the immunity of a State from suit without its consent from a private individual was a bedrock principle that the Framers took to the Convention.
1998.98-436,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3486.628,3497.544,"Didn't the Framers, by the same token, assume that there would not be commerce power statutes binding and running against the State in its capacity as a State?"
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3498.645,3500.675,--I see that my time is expired.
1998.98-436,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3500.675,3501.937,You may give a brief answer.
1998.98-436,2,37681,peter_j_brann,,3502.127,3504.469,I think so.
1998.98-436,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.779,3508.671,"Thank you, Mr. Brann."
1998.98-436,3,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3511.662,3513.224,"Two points, if I can."
1998.98-436,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3558.597,3560.447,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
