1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,256.148,261.634,"No, sir, it was not in bond but that the principle is the same, if Your Honor please."
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,318.439,325.106,Did the liquor leaves the private bonding warehouse of the respondent?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,325.106,325.64,Yes.
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,325.64,327.923,Does it leave in bond also?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,327.923,332.171,"Well, it maybe withdrawn from bond and sold."
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,332.171,333.131,In -- in Kentucky?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,333.131,335.028,"In Kentucky, yes."
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,335.028,340.956,"Well, is there any dispute as to whether you can levy a tax on that amount or not?"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,340.956,342.296,Not that I'm aware of.
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,342.296,353.645,"Alright, then are we dealing here only with that which will be -- be transported from the bonded warehouse in bond through Kentucky?"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,353.645,359.661,"No, we're dealing only with that that is being brought into Kentucky in bond and put in the private bonded warehouse."

1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,363.735,364.926,I see.
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,364.926,389.866,"And as a matter of control, as a revenue measure, it is Kentucky's position that in conformity with the Gordon case, that Kentucky has the absolute right to or to apply the tax, its regulatory tax, its license tax on the business of bringing this whisky into the State."
1963.389,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.28,453.486,How does this whisky get to Kentucky?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,455.805,459.588,It comes in through New Orleans or Chicago.
1963.389,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,459.588,464.672,"And let's say it comes to New Orleans, it comes by a ship and it's unloaded in New Orleans?"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,464.672,465.522,It's unloaded with water.
1963.389,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.269,473.056,"Is it bonded, bonded all the way?"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,473.056,473.896,It's bonded all the way.
1963.389,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.591,483.114,Who have -- does the -- does the respondent have title to (Voice Overlap) Scotland?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,483.114,485.88,"To my understanding, the respondent has title to the whisky."
1963.389,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,485.88,486.747,From the time in the Scotland?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,486.747,489.646,Yes.
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,489.646,504.233,"Oh, if Kentucky would decide that it doesn't want any type of whisky coming in that, it wants to sell only bourbon made in Kentucky, is it your contention that the Twenty-first Amendment would permit that?"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,504.233,510.319,"It is my contention, if Your Honor please, that the Twenty-first Amendment which -- would permit that."
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,510.319,517.739,"The -- before Twenty-first Amendment, of course, they took a Webb-Kenyon Act to do it --"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,517.739,517.972,Yes.
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,517.972,519.941,-- is it not?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,527.212,528.331,In that respect.
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,528.331,532.688,"That was your understanding, was it not, in connection with the passage of the Amendment?"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,532.688,534.552,"That is my understanding, if the Court please."
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,551.639,553.517,Permitted to be brought in or not brought in?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,553.517,554.42,Are brought -- are not brought in.
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,554.42,558.57,They have it all made in the States if it has to have complete control --
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,558.57,559.171,Absolute control.
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,559.171,560.944,-- of the liquor transaction in the State?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,560.944,563.162,In the State.
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,563.162,578.61,"Is there any difference between transporting it through the State in bonded trucks and -- and on the other hand, having it remain in bonded warehouses in Kentucky?"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,578.61,579.09,No.
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,605.725,608.613,Because you tax it.
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,609.816,613.081,"I believe under the Gordon case, yes, we could."
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,613.081,625.783,"So if -- if it's an in bond going from -- from New York, port of New York to -- to Illinois, passes through Kentucky, you can tax it (Voice Overlap)?"
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,625.783,628.655,"Under the Gordon case, yes."
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,628.655,630.119,You mean a lot is moving?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,630.119,635.518,"No, if it comes -- well, it's in the possession of the individual in Kentucky."
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,635.518,644.671,While it's traveling in bond through -- through Kentucky.
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,644.671,652.658,"Well, whether we could tax it or not as a matter of control, probably, not but we can control its movement, absolutely, yes, I believe we could."
1963.389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.06,682.322,"The end result of this, I suppose, is that all of the States in the United States passed a law there -- that they're -- no one may have possession or sell any imported liquors within the borders of the State that you would say that each State could do that and the fact was all over and there are being no foreign liquors whatsoever in the United States, that's the Twenty-first Amendment."
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,682.322,683.679,That's the Twenty-first Amendment.
1963.389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.679,687.231,Yes.
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,687.231,691.952,Have you read the debates in connection with the passage of that Amendment by the Senate and the House?
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,691.952,693.647,"No, I have not."
1963.389,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,693.647,704.993,Not enlighten to your side.
1963.389,0,45937,william_s_riley,,704.993,709.749,Thank you.
1963.389,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,709.749,713.413,Mr. Cox.
1963.389,1,35665,millard_cox,,713.413,717.103,May it please the Court.
1963.389,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,920.508,922.619,What's a proof gallon mean?
1963.389,1,35665,millard_cox,,922.619,935.191,"The proof gallon is a -- is a gallon of liquor at a 100 degrees proof, the proof being 50% of alcohol per volume."
1963.389,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,935.191,942.536,"So for every -- every gallon containing 50% alcohol, you pay 10 cents, is that it?"
1963.389,1,35665,millard_cox,,942.536,943.382,10 cents.
1963.389,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,947.187,947.774,Get a little more a gallon.
1963.389,1,35665,millard_cox,,947.774,951.956,"13 -- yes, 13.5 cents less."
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2466.709,2471.582,"I have one or two things, if Your Honor please, that I like to bring out."
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2490.968,2497.828,Does -- does Mr. -- does Mr. Cox concede that -- that they have the right to control the commerce?
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2497.828,2500.541,"Well, no, that the State itself -- I don't -- I didn't catch that up."
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2506.75,2517.628,"No, I understood -- I understood Mr. Cox to say that the State of Kentucky could keep even imported liquor entirely out of the State if it wanted to --"
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2517.628,2517.958,That's right.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2517.958,2526.457,-- under the Commerce Clause because the Twenty-first Amendment had given the States the right to regulate commerce in liquor.
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2537.015,2537.63,Package.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2537.63,2538.867,-- coming from other places.
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2538.867,2538.964,I understand it.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2538.964,2545.163,"Now, he says it is in regulation this taxation that we're dealing with now, is that the issue?"
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2545.163,2547.68,The issue is both regulation and taxations.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2547.68,2551.327,What is there in the Act that has to do with regulation?
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2551.327,2560.376,The -- the Act requires that the permit be obtained by the importer.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2560.376,2566.014,He did -- they did supply -- they did take out the permit and he says there is no objection to that.
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2566.014,2566.688,That is correct.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2566.688,2568.559,He says it's a tax that they are objecting.
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2568.559,2580.218,And as a -- as a revenue and control measure then there is a 10-cent fee for the permit for proof gallon at the time the permit is purchased before the liquor is brought into the State.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2580.218,2583.343,And you say that 10 cents is regulatory as well as --
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2583.343,2586.087,Both a regulatory and revenue measure.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2586.087,2595.835,"Well, how much of it is regulatory, because I am telling him to maintain that under the -- the Import-Export Law."
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2605.739,2613.504,"I believe that that is, if your -- if the Court please, if Your Honor please, that is immaterial here because it's both regulatory and revenue and it is a complementary."
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2635.166,2651.31,You mean then that you could -- you could levy a tax high enough to make the difference between the differential between foreign liquor and the liquor you -- you produce in Kentucky.
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2651.31,2653.015,"To make it competitive, yes."
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2653.015,2654.176,Yes.
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2656.066,2660.288,Even though it's in the original package and it's being brought into the State.
1963.389,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2660.288,2662.4,I believe that's a part of the Twenty-one -- Twenty-first Amendment.
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2662.4,2665.38,"Twenty-first Amendment, yes."
1963.389,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2665.38,2673.194,(Inaudible) it was suggested by Mr. Cox in -- on his view of the brief.
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2696.774,2704.787,"Not exactly, because there is also a 10-cent tax on distilling Bourbon whisky for proof gallon in Kentucky."
1963.389,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2707.078,2708.141,"Well, that's the real reason in fact."
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2708.141,2709.521,"That's the real reason, yes."
1963.389,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2709.521,2711.859,It's not anything like my $10 (Voice Overlap) --
1963.389,2,45937,william_s_riley,,2711.859,2714.822,No.
