1990.89-1298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.022,"We'll hear argument now in 89-1298, Ingersoll-Rand v. Perry McClendon."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,47.314,56.837,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.107,193.123,"Mr. Hurd, let me just ask you a question if I may."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,211.968,212.968,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,212.968,214.537,What if they had had a written contract.
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,244.972,254.078,"In that case, Your Honor, if the employer's motivation is alleged to be a purpose to interfere with the attainment of benefits under a plan--"
1990.89-1298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.078,254.595,Right.
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,254.595,267.922,"--then that would stay a claim under section 510 of ERISA, and that State law, whatever State law was used, contract or misrepresentation and so forth, that State law would be preempted as applied to that cause of action."
1990.89-1298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,267.922,274.008,Even if his damages that he seeks are the salary for the 19th year... the 20th year of the contract?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,274.008,275.777,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,275.777,279.145,Would he have a remedy for those damages in... in Federal court?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,279.145,280.229,Absolutely.
1990.89-1298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,312.866,316.568,"And that State rule of law, as you interpret, relates to the plan?"
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,316.568,322.555,"Yes, it does, Your Honor, through the employer's purpose to interfere with rights under the plan."
1990.89-1298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,337.398,351.492,"Mr. Hurd, under the Federal cause of action that you say would exist under the circumstances inquired about by Justice Stevens, would there be any right to punitive damages?"
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,351.492,359.43,"Your Honor, the lower courts so far have held that punitive damages are not available in actions--"
1990.89-1298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.43,360.946,What about attorneys' fees?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,360.946,368.452,"--Under ERISA, Your Honor, attorneys' fees may be granted in the discretion of the court to a prevailing plaintiff."
1990.89-1298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,368.452,380.093,"Counsel, what... what would happen in Justice Stevens' hypothetical if there were three or four independent reasons given for the termination?"
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,410.463,420.569,"I would say, Your Honor, it preempts the cause of action based on the employer's alleged motivation to deprive the individual of benefits."
1990.89-1298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.336,425.705,What you say... if... you said... if one of the motivations?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,425.705,427.205,--That's correct.
1990.89-1298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,444.584,447.1,May I push that just a step further?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,467.997,483.959,"If the... if the cause of action alleged by the individual does not reveal that he's relying on an alleged motivation to deprive the individual of benefits, then that does not have any connection with a reference to a plan."
1990.89-1298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.815,503.021,"If it comes out on discovery and he then says I didn't know what the reason was but now I realize the real reason was they wanted to save money on the pension, then his case goes out the window as soon as he finds that out?"
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,503.437,506.373,The case becomes Federal in character.
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.667,530.987,"Mr. Hurd, suppose an employer induces him to quit by threatening him."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,547.282,552.667,"--In your question, Your Honor, I haven't heard any connection with a reference to a plan."
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.667,558.888,"Well, the reason... the reason that they want him to quit is so that he won't... he won't qualify for benefits."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,558.888,559.756,If that--
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.756,570.029,"So... so it is... it is, indeed... it fits within section 110, that they are discriminating against him in order to prevent him from becoming entitled under the plan."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,573.314,578.449,"--State law, State criminal laws of general application are expressly--"
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.449,581.301,"No, this is... is an assault, civil action for assault, tort."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,581.301,582.67,--Not a civil action.
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.67,584.286,Couldn't bring a civil action?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,584.286,586.288,There is a section 510 case--
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.288,587.722,How about a wrongful death action?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,594.392,595.292,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.161,608.635,"Well, but it's testing the principle of whether any State law, no matter how generally applicable, if it happens to overlap in its... in its relief with section 510 is... is invalid."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,608.635,621.526,"--Well, our point, Your Honor, is that Congress decided what remedies should be available to someone who believed that the employer discharged, fined, expelled, et cetera, or otherwise discriminated against them."
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.526,624.395,So what is your answer to the wrongful death?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,628.263,629.963,My answer is that would be preempted.
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.963,630.465,Oh.
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,650.427,651.378,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.378,659.116,"Suppose the... suppose the employer wins on that, that it... that he didn't fire him for that reason."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,668.186,677.744,"That's a question of Federal courts, Your Honor, after the individual has lost on the merits of his Federal claim what happens to the State--"
1990.89-1298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,677.744,684.747,"Well, he loses on it because it really... the employer really didn't interfere with plan benefits."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,687.182,688.049,--That's correct.
1990.89-1298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.049,692.919,So what... but he's nevertheless may have a State claim.
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,692.919,700.007,Because the discharge was wrongful for other reasons such as a breach of the common law contract.
1990.89-1298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.007,700.24,"Yes, exactly."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,700.873,700.873,That's correct.
1990.89-1298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.873,707.86,"So how does he protect himself while this Federal case is dismissed, I mean while the State cause of action is being dismissed?"
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,713.014,722.719,The Federal court would have pendent jurisdiction over those purely State law claims while considering the Federal cause of action under section 510.
1990.89-1298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.719,727.071,So he should bring his State law claims with him in the Federal court?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,727.071,728.04,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,728.04,733.427,May... may I just add one point to the question Justice Scalia was asking?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,782.424,783.141,Absolutely.
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.141,787.995,That you didn't fire him for no reason at all but precisely in order to prevent his recovering.
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,815.478,818.097,"I suppose so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.053,830.072,"Well, more than that."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,836.559,839.094,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.555,859.59,"Well, an assault doesn't require any particular motive, either."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,876.017,876.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.219,890.192,"But if... but if the... but if it's proved in the case that the reason for the assault was to deprive him of pension benefits, then it's preempted?"
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,890.726,907.321,"If he can recover for assault merely because he was in fact assaulted without regard to the reason, then I'd say that his cause of action for assault has no necessary connection to or reference to a plan, and--"
1990.89-1298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.321,909.856,Even if it's proven what the real reason was?
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,909.856,912.808,"--That's correct, because it's not necessary to his recovery, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,919.629,924.45,"Mr. Hurd, before you sit down, you probably have answered this but I want to be sure."
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,929.151,931.269,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,931.269,932.786,I didn't hear it.
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,932.786,933.555,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,933.555,936.257,"Well, if it's so clear, why didn't you?"
1990.89-1298,0,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,936.257,944.411,"The truth of the matter is, Your Honor, that the case was treated as a run-of-the-mill wrongful discharge case from the very beginning."
1990.89-1298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,972.096,974.263,"Thank you, Mr. Hurd."
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,976.898,989.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.327,1022.827,What about my... what about my breach of contract case?
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1024.862,1035.718,"Yes, and... and in the contract case, as I understand it, there is no question that the person would have a claim under ERISA."
1990.89-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.654,1063.287,Excuse me.
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1073.193,1076.462,"--Well, firing him is discharging him, and discharging him is covered by the statute."
1990.89-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.462,1076.978,"--Oh, okay."
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1076.978,1082.782,"The other things in the statute are expel, suspend, discipline and discriminate."
1990.89-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.782,1087.852,So you're... you're not even sure he'd have a... an ERISA action?
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1087.852,1089.471,"I... I don't think he would, probably."
1990.89-1298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.604,1114.503,"But in my hypothetical, if the plaintiff proves the breach in the contract but fails to prove that the reason was to terminate, you know, get him out of the pension but, rather, they just... it was other... otherwise a breach of the contract so that the basis for Federal jurisdiction would no longer survive, there would be, I take it, ancillary jurisdiction to grant relief on a State law claim even though it had been preempted?"
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1114.503,1116.472,--I assume that that's how they... yes.
1990.89-1298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.472,1118.439,So that preemption is kind of an on and off thing?
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1131.314,1137.285,"Well, I... I think that this sort of thing happens all the time in these sorts of cases, as... as this one."
1990.89-1298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1154.414,1163.852,"And then your view is that the entire case should have been transferred to the United States District Court, and it would have pendent jurisdiction on the other issues?"
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1163.852,1164.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.059,1204.078,"Of course, this is a remedy against the employer, not against the client."
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1204.078,1227.676,"--Justice Stevens, section 510 of ERISA also establishes a remedy against employers, and it is enforceable under section 502(a)(3), one of the six... one of the six provisions that was described in the opinion of the Court in Russell as interlocking, interdependent, and interrelated remedies."
1990.89-1298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.962,1232.08,Nothing in that opinion says anything about preemption.
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1232.08,1242.103,"Well, but the fact remains that this Court has relied on the comprehensive nature of the six remedies considered as a whole."
1990.89-1298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.892,1331.51,That's all a strong argument why you need a Federal remedy.
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1338.331,1340.116,We think it shows two things.
1990.89-1298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.594,1358.944,Why does it show that?
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1363.065,1365.531,"--Well, it's a very broad preemption provision."
1990.89-1298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.837,1375.956,"It's a hard argument, yeah."
1990.89-1298,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1398.488,1410.379,"Well, this particular State law remedy is, of course, identical to the remedy Congress provided in ERISA, and we think Congress put that remedy in ERISA because it thought that it relates to ERISA."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1503.739,1512.677,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Honorable Court:"
1990.89-1298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1652.167,1667.527,"Mr. Tavormina, do you agree that Mr. McClendon also had a cause of action under ERISA, section 510, to compel reinstatement or payment of the benefits?"
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1667.527,1672.165,"Your Honor, he did have a cause of action under ERISA to compel that."
1990.89-1298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1690.71,1698.482,"Well, since he did have a cause of action, doesn't that indicate that the cause of action relates to the terms of the plan?"
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1698.482,1702.35,"No, Your Honor, it does not indicate it relates to the plan."
1990.89-1298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.792,1752.165,Certainly all the preemption provisions of ERISA were not necessarily put in to protect employees as opposed to employers?
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1752.165,1767.358,"--No, Your Honor, but the key element of the preemption provisions were to ensure uniformity to the employers to avoid different processing and different procedures in different States, if they operated across State lines."
1990.89-1298,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1779.582,1791.121,"Well, I thought in Pilot Life the Court held that section 502 of ERISA was the exclusive mechanism for enforcement of obligations just like this one."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1791.121,1802.429,"Your Honor, you're exactly right, but Pilot Life was a holding where the Court said, all we're dealing with here is the way a claim should have been processed under a specific plan."
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.758,1885.483,"No, only if it is alleged and it... it is an essential part of the State cause of action that the reason for the dismissal was specifically to prevent the vesting of the pension."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1885.483,1887.602,"--Well, Your Honor, but the way--"
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.602,1890.887,"I mean, that certainly narrows the category of cases enormously."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1890.887,1910.15,"--But under the contract example, if the contract included wages... I'm going to pay a certain amount of money, plus I'm going to vest you in 20 years... and the contract was then terminated after 19 years... breach of contract action, wrongful termination action, what are your elements of damages?"
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.0,1918.656,"It may be an element of damages, but it is not, as it is in this suit, an element of the cause of action."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1928.929,1939.569,"Sir, it's different, but if you look at the Court's decision in English v. GE, that was the Energy Reorganization Act that was involved in that case."
1990.89-1298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.474,1977.778,"But there... there you didn't have the express and preemption provisions that you do with ERISA, did you?"
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,1977.778,1991.669,"--No... well, Your Honor, you had... you didn't have an express preemption provision, but you had two very similar enforcement statutes, one that said you couldn't discriminate or discharge an employee, and the other that gave specific remedies for any action under that--"
1990.89-1298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1991.669,2007.547,"I... I think you'll find the Court's treatment of preemption has been quite different in ERISA cases, where you have a broad, statutory preemption provision, as opposed to simply occupation of the field and implied preemption, where they're simply claiming it's the same cause of action."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2007.547,2020.272,"--Your Honor, I agree with that, but again, you have the State law and you have the preemption opinion... preemption provision, which, if you look at the definition of State, it says,"
1990.89-1298,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.349,2095.522,You're... You're saying that a cause of action under 510 doesn't relate to ERISA?
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2095.522,2097.722,"Well, Your Honor, it doesn't relate--"
1990.89-1298,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2097.722,2099.307,"I mean, isn't that... isn't that the effect of your position?"
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2099.307,2105.128,"--It doesn't relate to the terms and conditions of an ERISA plan, and that's what preemption is supposed to go to."
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.195,2134.647,"Actually, it doesn't say that."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2143.753,2150.923,"Your Honor, I agree with that, but I also go back to the language of the definition of State, where it says,"
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.824,2199.922,"Petitioner's explanation, and it strikes me as a good one, is that the definition of the term State to include political subdivisions that purport to regulate is an expansion, so that you qualify as a State even though you... ah... you are not a State in the narrow sense, if you purport to regulate."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2212.664,2213.497,"Well, Your Honor, I--"
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.497,2215.33,--And the test is whether it relates to the plan.
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2215.33,2226.322,"--When you say, whether it relates to the plan, you have to go back to the terms and conditions of a plan, or the administration of a plan versus a cause of action for an employer's motivation."
1990.89-1298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.322,2228.174,"Well, why do you have to do that?"
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2235.827,2251.372,"Because I think if you look at the majority opinion, for instance, in the Halifax case, where the plant closing law came down from the State, and they said so many plants have been closing in Maine, if an employer closes a plant we're going to demand a one-time severance payment."
1990.89-1298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.876,2384.876,May I interrupt you there for a moment?
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2404.955,2413.645,"--Well, Your Honor, I would again just go to the Court's opinions in Silkwood, for instance, where the Court said that punitive damages, or the prospect of punitive damages--"
1990.89-1298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.645,2418.68,"Yes, but there, you didn't have a Federal interest in maintaining the financial stability of the employer."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2428.655,2435.475,"--Well, Your Honor, you have the plan, and then you have the employer, and this highlights, again, the difference between the two."
1990.89-1298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.093,2443.211,"It's his conduct, but that conduct could rub off on a plan if he's responsible there."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2451.067,2470.878,"--Well, Your Honor, that's true, and hopefully that will make employers look at it more closely and focus on not terminating someone's employment whether it be 5, 10, 15, 30, 40 years, and not... not terminate that person's employment for the principal reason of avoiding pension obligations."
1990.89-1298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.549,2493.228,"All I'm suggesting is, there is a Federal interest in... it may not be sufficient to prevail, but there's at least a Federal interest which would support an argument against punitive damages in order to maintain the kind of balance that you've got in ERISA that might not necessarily be available in the State system."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2493.228,2501.583,"--I would agree with that, Your Honor, and also, I don't know for sure if ERISA has excluded the idea, or this thing of punitive damages."
1990.89-1298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.135,2507.153,"None of us knows, yet."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2507.153,2507.82,--I don't know if that's ever been ruled upon.
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.82,2511.855,Do you have a jury trial in the ERISA action as compared to the State action?
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2511.855,2513.641,"Would you, or did we?"
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.641,2514.091,Yes.
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2516.509,2517.726,Not under ERISA.
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2517.726,2519.878,Would you be entitled to a jury trial under State law?
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2519.878,2520.361,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.361,2538.607,"Well, do you think an employer might be less inclined to set up one of these newfangled pension plans that the Government was trying to encourage if he knew that he'd be subject to a... a jury action in State court for allegedly dismissing people in order to avoid the rights vesting under the plan?"
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2538.607,2550.814,"Well, Your Honor, if we use that logic, then we're basically saying that because ERISA limits the damages... because I think everyone agrees that there's nothing conflicting about the cause of action."
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.222,2562.722,Right.
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2562.722,2563.74,--Than the right to a jury trial.
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.74,2567.192,But isn't that conceivably why the Federal Government put in that provision?
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2583.82,2586.503,"Your Honor, I... that could have been something considered."
1990.89-1298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.622,2589.891,"Well, perhaps--"
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2590.891,2597.145,"Unless there are further questions, I have nothing further."
1990.89-1298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.145,2598.747,"Thank you, Mr. Tavormina."
1990.89-1298,2,33211,john_w_tavormina,,2598.747,2599.43,Thank you.
1990.89-1298,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2599.43,2605.234,"Mr. Hurd, you have 4 minutes remaining."
1990.89-1298,3,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,2605.234,2613.923,"I think it's important to understand that, throughout ERISA, Congress was making a delicate balance."
1990.89-1298,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.786,2813.302,May... may I just ask this one question?
1990.89-1298,3,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,2820.356,2821.142,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1298,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.142,2821.775,It could not?
1990.89-1298,3,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,2821.775,2829.748,"Claims of violation of section 510 are enforced under section 502(a)(3), of which the Federal courts have exclusive--"
1990.89-1298,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.748,2835.032,"There's something in the conference report that's quoted that says that whether it's brought in State or Federal court, it's still a Federal cause of action."
1990.89-1298,3,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,2835.834,2843.638,--I think that portion of the conference report is referring to claims for benefits under 502(a)(1)(b).
1990.89-1298,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.638,2844.138,--I see.
1990.89-1298,3,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,2844.138,2845.79,Claims for benefits--
1990.89-1298,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.79,2846.173,Rather than a claim of this kind.
1990.89-1298,3,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,2846.173,2850.042,"--Can be brought in either State or Federal court, although the law applied is Federal law."
1990.89-1298,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.042,2850.661,"Is Federal law, right."
1990.89-1298,3,27187,hollis_t_hurd,,2850.661,2858.815,"But under 502(a)(3), which is used to enforce section 510, only the Federal courts have jurisdiction of those actions."
1990.89-1298,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2858.815,2862.052,"Thank you, Mr. Hurd."
