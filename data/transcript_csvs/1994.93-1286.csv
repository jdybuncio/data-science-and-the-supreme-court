1994.93-1286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.689,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-1286, American Airlines v. Myron Wolens."
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,10.956,16.11,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.487,89.641,"What about a negligence claim arising out of a plane crash, Mr. Ennis?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,100.247,107.769,"Your Honor, in Morales this Court ruled that not every claim that literally relates to rates, routes, and services is preempted."
1994.93-1286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,122.945,131.05,"--accidents can have a very powerful effect on service, can they not?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,131.05,136.889,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the Morales test stands for two propositions."
1994.93-1286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.625,197.093,"It certainly wasn't mentioned in... that test certainly wasn't mentioned in Morales, was it?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,197.093,201.414,"Your Honor, the actual formulation of the test in Morales was not mentioned."
1994.93-1286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.298,248.294,"What if a potential passenger has a ticket and a reservation that says, that guarantees him... I know airlines don't do it, but supposing we have an oddball airline that does, guarantees him passage on the 4:00 p.m. flight from Chicago to Washington, and he gets there, and he's just told, well, we've sold the place to somebody else."
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,256.348,267.273,"Generally, Your Honor, those kinds of denied boarding claims will be preempted, because most of those claims will assert a direct right to a particular rate, route, or service."
1994.93-1286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.199,288.42,"What does a person do, go over and stand in line at the Department of Transportation?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,288.42,297.275,"What the person does is, that person would have the same remedies that this Court found sufficient in Morales for the claims that were preempted there."
1994.93-1286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.275,298.56,"What does he do, though?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,298.56,308.25,"Well, he can file a... first attempt to negotiate informally with the airlines, which works in the vast majority of cases, and second can file a complaint with the Department of Transportation."
1994.93-1286,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,313.57,315.154,Has it redressed any so far?
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,315.154,316.189,"--Yes, they have, Your Honor."
1994.93-1286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,331.698,333.733,"Mr. Ennis, can you tell us what else would be left out?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,338.819,341.887,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have to answer that in two ways."
1994.93-1286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.913,418.553,"Mr. Ennis, is it your position that any subject or question or issue that's within the competence and the jurisdiction of the DOT is preempted?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,418.553,422.105,"Your Honor, let me try to answer the question this way."
1994.93-1286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.56,461.547,"But the DOT's jurisdiction is not phrased in terms of rates, routes, and services, is it, or is it?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,461.547,462.249,No.
1994.93-1286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.057,486.532,"Yes, I understand, but you have been saying that certain matters can be heard by the DOT, and I'm just asking myself whether or not there is room for some concurrent jurisdiction."
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,486.532,497.505,"Your Honor, I think there might be room for concurrent jurisdiction for all those types of claims, such as the value of lost luggage claims, that would not impact competitive decision-making."
1994.93-1286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.077,544.986,"Well, isn't deregulation more about freeing airlines from intrusive Government oversight than it was concerned about requiring airlines to keep their promises and let them be enforced?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,544.986,552.074,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, the deregulation act really had, and the Government acknowledges this, three distinct purposes."
1994.93-1286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.843,590.682,"Well, could the DOT promulgate a regulation saying that claims of this type should proceed in State court?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,590.682,601.34,"Your Honor, that would be a very difficult question about whether that kind of regulation would be so inconsistent with the statute that it would be beyond the DOT's power."
1994.93-1286,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,622.986,637.08,"What about a... if the airline sells a passenger, a prospective passenger a ticket at a certain rate and the passenger goes to the gate on the day of the flight and is told, well, we just upped the rates, and it will be $100 more?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,644.084,644.936,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,662.028,691.548,"But that direct right is in fact, I would have thought, central to your claim to be able to compete, because you cannot compete effectively unless the offers that you make are offers that your customers or prospective customers can depend on, so that if the customer cannot enforce the contract which he thinks he makes with you, which is the essence of your competitive activity, then that is, in fact, a direct threat to the very competition which the act is supposed to foster."
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,691.548,698.32,"Justice Souter, we are not taking the position that those kinds of contract claims cannot be enforced."
1994.93-1286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,699.686,703.705,"They can only be enforced in the administrative Federal forum, you said."
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,703.705,705.224,--They can only be enforced by DOT.
1994.93-1286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,705.224,708.442,And is DOT enforcing contracts of that sort?
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,708.442,711.728,"They have on several occasions enforced contracts like that, Your Honor."
1994.93-1286,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,712.594,727.673,"Why does it... and given the fact that the enforcement of those contracts is, I would suppose, central to your capacity to compete, why, nonetheless, is that, and even the existence of the Federal forum, an argument for preemption?"
1994.93-1286,0,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,741.497,744.699,"Let me try to answer the question this way, Justice Souter."
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1249.926,1267.421,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.918,1289.603,Could it do so under the statute?
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1289.603,1292.988,"--In our view, it is not empowered to adjudicate private rights."
1994.93-1286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.151,1400.972,May I ask what you do with the Norfolk and Western case in which they rely on the fact that enforcement of a contract is enforcement of a law?
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1400.972,1408.078,"The... in Norfolk & Western, the entire function of the statute was quite different from the Airline Deregulation Act."
1994.93-1286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1468.716,1473.686,But Mr. Ennis told us that you had entertained a similar claim and denied it on the merits.
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1474.77,1510.026,"I'm not sure what he's referring to, unless he's referring to the petition for a proposed rulemaking which was filed by the Association of Discount Travel Brokers, and there the Department decided that the practices were not unfair and deceptive within the meaning of the Department's statute, but it expressly, in the order denying rulemaking, specified that we thought the types of claims, if any, were contract claims, and so we have not decided the contract question at issue in this case, and I'm not sure if there's another order that he's referring to."
1994.93-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1510.026,1524.719,"Well, on the Norfolk case, do you accept the conclusion of the Norfolk case that common law doctrine can be in some cases displaced under the Airline Deregulation Act?"
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1524.719,1529.44,"I do think that common law doctrine can be, in some instances, displaced, but I--"
1994.93-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1529.44,1536.261,"In other words, standard law, rule, regulation, et cetera can include State common law in an appropriate case."
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1536.261,1555.09,"--It can, but we don't believe that it includes contracts, because the provisions that that refers to are provisions with the force and effect of law, such as, for example, the tariffs, as opposed to private parties' agreements which, standing on their own, are really the voluntary undertakings of the parties and--"
1994.93-1286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1555.09,1555.524,Well--
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1555.524,1556.79,--are fully consistent with deregulation.
1994.93-1286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.79,1568.148,"--respondents are trying to hold the airline to what they say was promised, and it's hard to understand why it matters whether you call it a contract action or a consumer fraud action."
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1573.736,1584.61,"The result is only the same, Justice O'Connor, if you look at the claim without reference to the act of the carrier which gives rise to the contract obligation."
1994.93-1286,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1608.559,1608.792,So--
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1641.113,1646.6,"I think this relates to what Justice Breyer was saying about, there is a difference between these two causes of action."
1994.93-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1666.079,1670.632,"But in making this argument, you don't rely on the word ""law"" under the statute."
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1682.19,1684.909,"--In certain cases, but we think that taken together--"
1994.93-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1684.909,1692.229,"So your argument is not really tied to the words of the statute in a very close way, I take it."
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1692.229,1712.626,"--Well, I would disagree, Justice Kennedy, insofar as what is being enforced is not law in our example, it's contract, and so the enforcement of contract we think is not what Congress contemplated in this act, and we think that's reinforced by the reference to provisions having the force and effect of law, which is--"
1994.93-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1712.626,1722.934,"Suppose there's a civil code section in the State of California, which there is, which says that contracts are enforceable if there's consideration."
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1724.967,1731.521,--I think you're right in pointing out that our theory does not depend on the difference between common law and statutory law.
1994.93-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1742.812,1752.869,"I think you gave as one example an unconscionability doctrine that could be common law, but that that would not be written into the parties' bargain."
1994.93-1286,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1761.559,1786.341,"The standard that we propose to elaborate on our concept is that doctrines which, on their face or as applied, interfere with the airlines' ability to set their own rates, routes, and services, and the reason that we point to unconscionability or public policy doctrines is because those are doctrines which involve the court in admitting there was a bargain and then judging the fairness of that bargain--"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,1842.042,1852.1,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1286,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2039.154,2039.971,Without limit?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2045.725,2071.042,"Well, injunctive relief in certain cases could be regulatory if it were to undo or undermine the Federal deregulatory scheme, but as a general rule, if the type of injunctive relief we are talking about would be specific performance, that should be a means of enforcing a contract, unless it undermines the Federal deregulatory scheme."
1994.93-1286,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2071.042,2074.327,--Would you remind me where you stand on injunctive relief in this very case?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2078.712,2079.579,That is correct.
1994.93-1286,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2082.164,2087.217,Would you agree that punitive damages would be subject to preemption?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2087.217,2094.288,"Well, Justice Souter, as the Court noted in both Silkwood and Cipollone, punitive damages are not necessarily regulatory."
1994.93-1286,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2096.157,2108.798,"Well, neither are they the enforcement of the bargain, and I thought the essence of your bargain is that what you're asking for is the enforcement of a bargain, and that is precisely what the act was supposed to foster, but if you go to punitive damages you've passed that point."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2108.798,2110.333,--We aren't seeking punitive damages.
1994.93-1286,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2110.333,2121.225,"No, I realize, but doesn't your argument really force you for consistency's sake to say punitive damages would, in fact, be preempted?"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2121.225,2130.331,"Well, only to the extent that punitive damages, Justice Souter, would have a direct impact on the deregulatory scheme, which they often would, and in those instances they would be preempted."
1994.93-1286,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.827,2157.914,Your answer to Justice Souter is that it doesn't make any difference that they don't come as a result of the enforcement of the bargain.
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2157.914,2166.087,"It does make a difference in how they impact on the Federal deregulatory scheme, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1286,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2166.087,2175.959,"Yes, but I didn't think that the fact... I didn't think your argument was based on the idea that if you're simply enforcing a bargain it has no impact on the deregulatory scheme."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2185.798,2195.654,"Not that if it has an impact, Mr. Chief Justice, but if it undoes or undermines the Federal deregulatory scheme, there could be circumstances where even a voluntary agreement would have to be preempted."
1994.93-1286,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2218.352,2227.708,"Well, Mr. Gordon, if you trade-in frequent flyer mileage credits it's just another way of buying a ticket on the airline--"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2227.708,2228.991,I don't believe--
1994.93-1286,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2228.991,2246.353,"--and it seems to me that an action such as yours concerning the frequent flyer program relates to rates within the meaning of the statute, just as Morales indicated."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2252.323,2274.154,"--Justice O'Connor, if you were to look at the program brochure in our lawsuit, the allegations of the pleading, you will note that if you get a certain number of mileage credits, one of the many awards, perhaps 30 or 40 possibilities, is a free airline ticket."
1994.93-1286,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2318.433,2324.087,"Do you think most people that are in the frequent mileage program say, oh, I now have an award, not, I now have a free ticket?"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2324.087,2340.564,"Justice Kennedy, I don't know what most people say, but I believe that the terms which are before the Court indicate that if you get a certain number of mileage credits you get a free ticket, not that you pay with another form of currency not recognizable in the United States."
1994.93-1286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.564,2346.868,What is your suggestion as to how you separate the sheeps from the goats?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2367.116,2392.849,"Justice Breyer, we would suggest that as a general rule voluntary agreements should not be preempted under section 1305 because it's clear that Congress did not intend to preempt them, but that in the rare circumstance where a voluntary agreement undermines the Federal deregulatory scheme, then that should be preempted."
1994.93-1286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.849,2396.718,"Fine, and then how do you distinguish those two, and do you have primary jurisdiction to do it?"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2396.718,2397.435,"Well, the--"
1994.93-1286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.435,2399.253,Do you leave it up to the DOT?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2405.674,2423.718,"--Well, Justice Breyer, the DOT's jurisdiction is, of course, discretionary and nonexclusive, so the DOT can take jurisdiction of the subject matter, and that's an interesting response to why American would not be subjected to unreasonable laws of 50 States."
1994.93-1286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.806,2458.391,So here you'd follow the SG's approach?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2472.718,2489.328,"Well, I think that the case should just be affirmed, it would go back to the trial court, and if, on appeal again, there were some imposition of State law that the DOT or American Airlines felt related to rates, routes, or services, some State theory, then they would have that ground for appeal at another time."
1994.93-1286,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2516.414,2523.318,"Mr. Gordon, from what you've just said, you seem to be aligning yourself totally with the Government's position."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2549.051,2553.92,"Our brief was not as clear, Justice Ginsburg, because that's not our case."
1994.93-1286,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2571.649,2585.558,"But in your answer to Justice Breyer's question, you hypothesized the exercise of jurisdiction by the DOT, and indicated there would then be preemption."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2590.795,2597.199,Preemption... maybe I mis... wasn't clear in answering that question.
1994.93-1286,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2609.007,2622.065,"But if we had a case where the DOT had issued regulations or rules on a certain subject, would we turn just to the statute before us to determine whether or not there's preemption?"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2622.065,2630.92,"--We would turn to the statute and the DOT regulation would supersede, if it were the same subject, the State law, yes."
1994.93-1286,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2630.92,2635.99,"Because of the operation of the statute, not because of some other doctrine of field preemption?"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2635.99,2637.64,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1286,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2637.64,2659.273,"So then we do have to look at the words of the statute to determine the relative jurisdiction and jurisdictional competence of the State and the agency, and I'm not sure why the nonexercise of that power by the agency has anything to do with the interpretation of the statute."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2659.273,2669.046,"Well, this Court has stated many times, Justice Kennedy, that contemporaneous construction by an administrative agency should be given great deference, and that's all we're suggesting."
1994.93-1286,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.407,2719.144,"You're understandably worried about your own case, which I understand, but the thing that's difficult for me is exactly the same line of questioning."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2745.212,2769.594,"Your Honor, we believe that the primary jurisdiction doctrine would not be strictly applicable here because the DOT's jurisdiction in these cases is discretionary and nonexclusive."
1994.93-1286,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.882,2810.071,"Mr. Gordon, you take the position in your brief that your Consumer Fraud Act claim is not preempted, either, is that correct?"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2810.071,2811.788,"--Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1286,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.788,2814.023,"You don't agree with the Government on that point, then."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,2814.023,2823.229,"We disagree with the Government on that point because we do not believe our Consumer Fraud Act claim relates to the rates, routes, and services in more than a tenuous manner."
1994.93-1286,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3016.021,3049.094,"Well, I guess it is possible, of course, that under the present regime a dissatisfied customer could go to the DOT with a complaint and say, look, we think you, DOT, ought to order the airlines not to make retroactive changes, and I assume the Department of Transportation would have the authority to issue such a directive to the airlines if it chose to do so."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,3049.094,3050.677,Justice O'Connor--
1994.93-1286,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3050.677,3051.727,Do you disagree with that?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,3051.727,3059.7,--I only disagree to the extent the authority in that area that the DOT has is limited to unfair or deceptive practices.
1994.93-1286,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3062.068,3071.341,"Well, the Department of Transportation surely has the authority to direct the airlines not to make retroactive changes in these programs."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,3071.341,3077.595,I believe the Department of Transportation has the authority if they found it to be an unfair or deceptive practice.
1994.93-1286,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3087.117,3097.591,Could they have the authority to say all airline frequent flyer programs must be retroactive in order to protect the airline's capacity to adjust?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,3097.591,3102.995,"They would have the authority to enter such a rule, yes, Justice Kennedy."
1994.93-1286,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.995,3108.633,May I just ask one question that I'm kind of puzzling about?
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,3120.44,3127.694,"It isn't the relief that we are distinguishing, it is the relationship to rates, routes, and services."
1994.93-1286,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.694,3132.348,"But they have precisely the same impact on rates, routes, and services."
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,3135.866,3141.87,"One relates to the agreement of the parties, the other is an imposition of State law on deceptive practices."
1994.93-1286,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.822,3148.857,"You have not abandoned your consumer fraud position, have you?"
1994.93-1286,2,25372,gilbert_w_gordon,,3148.857,3150.274,We do not abandon it.
1994.93-1286,3,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3286.413,3287.696,Mr. Chief Justice:
1994.93-1286,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3360.877,3362.461,"Then why doesn't that pick up the tort claim, too?"
1994.93-1286,3,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3362.461,3365.948,"--Your Honor, because the tort claim would not have the same impact."
1994.93-1286,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3416.445,3420.666,"Mr. Ennis, does the savings clause save anything in the realm of contract?"
1994.93-1286,3,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3420.666,3421.849,Yes.
1994.93-1286,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3428.522,3433.723,I'm trying to find out what is the business that the State court can handle that would be labeled a contract claim?
1994.93-1286,3,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3433.723,3442.412,"--I think, Your Honor, the Court answers that question by looking at the text of 1305 to decide on that basis what is or is not preempted, and what is not preempted--"
1994.93-1286,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3442.412,3447.566,"Could you give me an example of something that wouldn't be preempted, a contract claim that would not be preempted under your view?"
1994.93-1286,3,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3447.566,3462.843,"--I think a contract claim for lost luggage in which the claimant says my bag was worth $500 and the airline says it was worth $300 is not going to be preempted, because it doesn't directly assert a right to a particular rate, route, or service, and its indirect effect will be too tenuous or remote."
1994.93-1286,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3479.852,3480.685,"Thank you, Mr. Ennis."
1994.93-1286,3,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3480.685,3481.168,Thank you.
1994.93-1286,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.168,3482.185,The case is submitted.
