1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,398.464,399.48,Your Honor--
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.48,404.821,--rather than a direct violation of Title VII or Section 1981?
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,404.821,412.975,"--The Third Circuit, Your Honor, had a sentence which said that the unions' conduct here violated the duty of fair representation."
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.265,428.781,"Well, do we have to deal with that as a theory, I suppose?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,428.781,431.687,"--Your Honor, you don't have to deal with it as a theory."
1986.85-1626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.365,506.72,Did the district court make a finding as to why the union had not raised claims of racial discrimination on grievances?
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,506.72,508.111,"--Your Honor, I think it did."
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.514,738.224,"Well, Mr. Weinberg, would you contest that the union would be guilty of racial discrimination if it just absolutely refused to process any grievances based on racial grounds, and they refused to process them because they just didn't want to process racial grievances?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,738.224,741.395,"Well, adding the second factor--"
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.395,741.802,Yes.
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,741.802,756.171,"--I would agree, Your Honor, that if... well, if a union decides not to process race discrimination claims for racial reasons, for racial animus, then that is clearly a grievance."
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.171,766.338,"Well, what if the union... could it be inferred, could racial animus be inferred from the fact that they just never processed a racial grievance; they just don't do it?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,766.338,771.789,"Your Honor, I think... I don't think it could be inferred from that fact alone."
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.475,786.627,"Well, in any event, I think from your recitation of the facts that that claim was found in your favor by the district court."
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,786.627,793.453,The district court found that the union had not discriminated in processing grievances; that blacks and whites were treated alike.
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.904,807.493,Was there no... was there... there was no finding that the union refused to process a grievance because it was a racial grievance?
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,807.493,808.993,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.729,846.103,"Well, what about when there wasn't another ground?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,846.103,854.677,"Your Honor, there is... there is... there are a couple of instances where there was not another ground, and I think you have to deal with those separately."
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.896,861.081,"Well, did it ever file a racial grievance where there wasn't any other ground?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,861.081,861.862,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.862,864.923,And that was found... so found by the district court?
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,864.923,872.546,"I don't think the court found one way or the other, but there are documents in the records which are grievances... which are racial grievances."
1986.85-1626,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.231,883.244,"Well, did the Court of Appeals affirm on the basis that... that the district court used?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,883.244,888.978,"--Your Honor, I believe that the Court of Appeals did affirm on the basis that the district court used."
1986.85-1626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.14,977.523,"What if the district court here had found that the union failed to present race discrimination claims when it could have, that it was not racially... that it was not discriminating between black people and white people, that its reason for failing to do that was simply its lack of expertise."
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,985.146,987.723,"I think it certainly would not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1080.735,1087.794,"That might have... from what you say, that might have been an easier ground to prove that the very complicated job relatedness ground."
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1087.794,1091.418,"Your Honor, the testimony was that it was not."
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1135.937,1155.568,"Mr. Weinberg, what if the district court had made a finding relative to the Title VII claim that the unions method and practices in the processing of employee grievances had a disparate impact on blacks?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1155.568,1159.675,"Your Honor, there was no such finding in this case."
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1159.675,1162.783,"I asked, what if the trial court had made that finding?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1162.783,1172.233,"Your Honor, there would be a threshold question, and that is that... I guess there'd be two threshold questions."
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1205.517,1207.671,That's not entirely clear to me.
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1210.952,1211.53,There is not.
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1218.559,1222.636,The district court here didn't make a finding one way or the other on that?
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1222.636,1224.01,"--No, there was no claim."
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.291,1226.682,"Well, there was a Title VII claim."
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1226.682,1237.255,"--No, there's a Title VII claim, but there was no claim that the unions had... had violated Title VII by having a policy which had a disparate impact."
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.906,1388.584,"No, you would say that... that even if in fact it were proven, as you assert it was not proven here except with respect to probationers, perhaps, that the union categorically would not process racial discrimination grievances, and would not do so because... well, never mind... just categorically would not do so."
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1396.02,1397.815,Your Honor--
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.815,1399.159,That's what you're saying.3--
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1399.159,1401.533,"--I am saying that, but I want to rephrase that a little bit."
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.533,1404.235,"--Why don't you start saying yes or no, and then explain it."
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1404.235,1404.641,Okay.
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.587,1434.445,"Yes, I was going to ask you whether you think the probationers--"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1434.445,1437.788,The probationary employees is a different situation entirely.
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1496.374,1502.106,"--Well, does that... could that amount to a disparate impact finding, in effect--"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1502.106,1502.747,--Your Honor--
1986.85-1626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1502.747,1516.991,"--that the union didn't process claims, for whatever reasons, for probationary employees, and that failure had this disparate impact because so many of the probationers being discharged or let go were black?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1516.991,1530.141,"--It is clear that that was not... in order... in order to know where there was a disparate impact on blacks because of the union's policy, you would have had to have proved a lot of things that were not proved in the trial court."
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.22,1615.561,"We have... speaking of what the courts based their finding on, the Court of Appeals found that there was no proper representative for the probationers anyway."
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1618.92,1622.575,"No, no, for the probationers that's not correct."
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.979,1632.415,Not for all?
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1632.415,1635.617,"Well, you know, I say that."
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1683.161,1684.349,Were?
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1684.349,1685.224,"Were, yes."
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.224,1686.083,Were what?
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1686.083,1686.988,Represented.
1986.85-1626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.828,1703.156,"It wasn't the your opponent that handed you that note, was it?"
1986.85-1626,0,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,1703.156,1704.139,--It was not.
1986.85-1626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1717.4,1719.477,"Very well, Mr. Weinberg."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,1720.883,1733.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.343,1864.139,Did the district court say that the union decision was motivated by racial animus?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,1864.139,1864.904,No.
1986.85-1626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1895.297,1898.983,"Well, of course, I take it it wasn't inadvertent on their part."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,1903.326,1907.09,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."

1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,1910.402,1911.728,That's right.
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.869,1921.101,Isn't that different... isn't that different than saying the refusal to process it was based on racial animus?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,1921.101,1934.72,"--Well, this Court has held that anytime a racial classification is drawn, that... that the necessary intent, the necessary racial animus is found."
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.72,1938.39,"No, we've said that when a racial classification of people is drawn."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,1941.14,1942.764,"Yes, Your Honor, in the--"
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.764,1946.012,"I mean, it's one thing to discriminate against... against a race of people."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,1958.023,1979.514,"--In Hunter v. Ericson and Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, this Court held that racial... classification of racial issues, racial matters, differently from other matters in the same area is a racial classification."
1986.85-1626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.875,2024.168,"Well, my earlier question to you, Mr. Ewing, was a factual one rather than a legal one."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2031.946,2046.035,The district court found the union to have the intent to treat violations of the nondiscrimination clause of the collective bargaining agreement differently from other clauses of the collective bargaining agreement.
1986.85-1626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.035,2048.987,"Yes, I suppose that would be obvious just from the action."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2054.953,2056.108,"Well, it suggests it."
1986.85-1626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.102,2118.488,"Well, if you consciously, knowingly do something, it's intentional in your view, without regard to the motive?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2132.219,2149.696,"Yes, Your Honor, just as in Palmore v. Sadatti, this Court struck down a decision of a Florida court removing a white child from the custody of her mother because the mother had married a black man."
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2163.095,2170.656,"Yes, but Mr. Ewing, you're giving a statutory issue here."

1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2286.297,2299.791,"Well, the district court found here that both the union and the employer avoided addressing the discrimination claims of the employees."

1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2416.389,2417.341,"That's right, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2417.341,2420.074,We don't have to assume it was because of the perceived desires of the white majority.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2420.074,2420.856,That's right.
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.856,2428.651,"And the second point, though, is that even the example you give comes within different statutory language."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2444.363,2445.596,"No, I was just--"
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.596,2447.72,--Or you're talking about 1981.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2447.72,2451.125,--In the example I gave with the real estate brokers?
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.125,2451.688,Yes.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2451.688,2456.156,"NO, I was only looking at the motive question there."

1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2457.234,2458.234,--Whether the motive was relevant.
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.234,2459.562,It's not relevant there.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2459.562,2463.248,But here there is still discrimination.

1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2485.303,2486.256,That is discrimination.

1986.85-1626,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2587.639,2589.982,"Well, what are you relying on here to support you?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2592.294,2592.763,"--Primarily on disparate treatment, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2602.212,2607.056,"Well, there was no finding of the district court, was there, of disparate impact?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2607.056,2610.288,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, there was, because the district court found--"
1986.85-1626,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2610.288,2614.552,"Can you show me, tell me, where in the record I would find that?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2614.552,2615.427,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2640.511,2645.885,"Well, that's--"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2649.382,2650.132,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.132,2664.315,"Well, I take it you are... didn't the Court of Appeals hold that the union has an affirmative duty to combat employer discrimination or not?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2664.315,2665.97,The Court of Appeals said that.
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.392,2669.626,Are you defending that statement?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2669.626,2674.169,"--We believe that's correct, but that is not necessary to the decision of this case."
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.169,2674.872,Why isn't it?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2674.872,2686.711,"Because what the district court found and the Court of Appeals affirmed, both of them said, this is... what we have here is something very different from mere passivity."
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.711,2695.178,"So it's all right with you, if we agree... if we agree with you, we nevertheless disaffirm what the Court of Appeals said about an affirmative duty on the union?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2695.178,2696.786,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.629,2817.83,Did the evidence show that the only probationary dischargees were black?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2817.83,2824.36,"Oh, no, about half of the people discharged during the probationary period were white."
1986.85-1626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2832.686,2840.449,And were any... any white probationary grievances claims grieved?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2840.449,2842.87,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2851.258,2853.023,The contract gave the probationers no rights?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2853.023,2854.008,--That's right.
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.008,2859.958,Let me just be sure I understand.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2873.0,2877.78,The contract gave basically no seniority rights--
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2877.78,2879.421,But did it give any rights at all?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2879.421,2880.53,--and no rights with respect to discharge.
1986.85-1626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.821,2900.49,And is it correct that the district court found the union had a uniform policy of not processing any of these grievances for probationers?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,2900.49,2901.708,The district court found that.
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.042,3028.328,"You think there's a square finding or facts in the record that indicate that a black person comes to the union and says, I was fired because I'm black or wasn't promoted because I'm black and I want a grievance; and the union says, I understand your claim, and I have no doubt that's why the employer did it, but we're just not going to file a grievance?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3028.328,3032.467,If... in the case of a discharge--
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.467,3034.357,We don't discriminate.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3043.308,3046.385,"--No, in the case of a discharge, the union would grieve it."
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.614,3068.299,"Well, are there some... what kind of grievances did they refuse to file altogether which would have been racial grievances?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3068.299,3077.141,"Basically, what the district court found was that they were reluctant to file racial discrimination grievances."
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3078.547,3079.0,"Well, that may be."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3084.92,3086.231,"Yes, there are, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.231,3087.637,--because it was a racial grievance?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3087.637,3088.84,Yes.
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.761,3091.699,And did the district court find that?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3091.699,3092.448,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.448,3093.526,Had filed none at all?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3093.526,3096.494,He... he found that their--
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.494,3100.68,"Because the only grievance you have is racial, we will not grieve this matter at all?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3100.68,3103.148,"--I don't know whether... well, yes--"
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.148,3103.897,That's what I asked you.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3103.897,3120.36,--the district court found that because... the union's position that it would grieve on other grounds where it could failed to take account of the numerous instances of racial harrassment where there were no other grounds on which to grieve.
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3120.36,3130.589,"Well, so again, did... are there... were there findings that... that the union wouldn't file a grievance at all because it was a racial grievance?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3130.589,3134.181,"In a particular case, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.181,3135.509,Yes.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3135.509,3136.275,The district court--
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.275,3137.993,That's the only kind there are.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3137.993,3142.475,"--Well, I wasn't sure whether your question--"
1986.85-1626,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3142.475,3150.614,"Well, are there specific cases where the union refused to file any grievance at all because it was a racial grievance?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3150.614,3151.861,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3160.248,3162.577,"Well, why don't you read to us some of these findings that you're talking about."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3162.577,3164.701,"I beg your pardon, Justice Marshall?"
1986.85-1626,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3164.701,3167.137,Why don't you read some of these findings to me?
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3173.916,3177.79,"Well, yes Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3219.9,3220.463,0 xxx.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3220.463,3222.291,That's a finding.
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3316.221,3321.111,"Sorry to interrupt you, but I have a question that you may not get to, and you've argued this in your brief."
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3346.319,3347.444,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.444,3354.504,"Now, so, why doesn't that automatically take racial harrassment out of the case for the union as well?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3354.504,3361.72,"Well, in the first place, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district... all of the district court's findings against the union."
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3365.391,3372.514,"Well, how can you find that there was no racial harrassment, but blame the union for failing to grieve racial harrassment?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3372.514,3392.867,"No, what the... what the Court of Appeals found was that on the... not that there was no racial harrassment, but that on the evidence remaining, once they reduce the limitations period, there was not sufficient evidence that the employer tolerated racial harrassment."
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.464,3465.743,"Did they admit that even when the only basis for the claim was a racial one, they wouldn't grieve it?"
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3474.177,3478.237,"No, there is no... no such limitation on the district court's finding."
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3480.424,3480.861,I'm not talking about its finding.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3483.189,3487.687,--The... the testimony--
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3487.687,3492.872,You say that the union admitted that they wouldn't bring harrassment claims.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3503.118,3504.181,--The testimony--
1986.85-1626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3504.181,3509.663,I don't understand them to have admitted that they would not bring a harrassment claim if that was the only thing available.
1986.85-1626,1,44588,william_h_ewing,,3509.663,3523.846,"--The testimony supports the district court's finding that the union was reluctant to, and avoided submitting racial discrimination grievances."

1986.85-1626,2,40712,robert_m_weinberg,,3546.981,3549.075,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1626,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3592.855,3598.931,Is there any specific finding contrary to that point?
