1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.304,"We’ll hear arguments first this morning in number 72-6609, Jimenez against Weinberger."
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,16.572,20.583,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-6609,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,103.295,115.811,"Mrs. Stevens, if all children, legitimate as well as illegitimate, born after the date of onset of disability were excluded from coverage, would you be here?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,115.811,118.433,"I would be here, but on slightly different posture."
1973.72-6609,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,153.133,162.906,"Well, is your posture then one that the difficulty with the statute is that it’s overly inclusive?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,162.906,170.742,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that the exclusion here, if I may put it that way, is “overinclusive.”"
1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,185.617,188.78,Doesn’t that often happen in line drawing?
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,188.78,200.687,"I believe it does happen, but I think that when there are less drastic means for sorting out the fraudulent from the valid claims, that those less drastic means have to be employed."
1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,249.537,258.884,"When you speak of fraudulent claims, are you referring to those that would involve the question of paternity?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,258.884,262.163,"That would be, I believe Your Honor, the major problem of proof because --"
1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,262.163,264.148,"That would be the major, you say?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,264.148,276.074,"There is also the issue or the possibility of a question of whether or not the child had been supported, but that is something that children who were previously born have to prove too."
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.125,306.73,"In those states that allow inheritance by illegitimate children, such illegitimate children are not ineligible under the federal statute, are they?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,306.73,308.489,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.477,314.162,"That is, if they have been recognized by the state courts."
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,315.69,323.48,"If they lived -- if they merely live in a state in which they would be allowed to inherit by the laws of intestate succession, they are eligible to receive these benefits."
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.48,329.824,Regardless of whether or not they’ve been found to be the illegitimate children by the state court?
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,329.824,333.995,I imagine that in the probate proceedings that might be an issue.
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.995,335.104,Yes.
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,335.104,340.269,But they are eligible regardless of what has happened prior to the death of the father.
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,341.045,350.041,"But in those states, in other words, the federal administrator and the administrative process has the aid of the fact-finding of the state courts, isn’t that right?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,350.041,355.61,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, and I think this points up a very important factor of this law."
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,444.075,447.213,What kind of benefits are these involved here?
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,449.438,449.985,He is living.
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,452.673,462.378,"Disability benefits that go directly to the -- it would go directly to the legitimate children and this isn’t any sort of an aid to dependent children program, is it?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,462.378,471.707,"No, this is the Social Security OASDI Program and they would -- the benefits would go to the children, to these illegitimate children."
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.707,472.693,Directly?
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,472.693,476.936,"Directly, probably in his name because he is their guardian."
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,476.936,481.26,It will go to --
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,481.26,506.827,"The issue that the Government depends on largely that illegitimate children are less likely to have been receiving support than legitimate children and that, therefore, this is a rational distinction is, in fact, irrelevant in this case because the section at issue makes dependency or the right to support a requirement of eligibility for all children."
1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.274,587.447,"In your view, is it irrational to have a presumption that legitimate children are likely to be receiving support and more likely to be receiving support than illegitimate children?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,587.447,607.447,"I’m not contesting that presumption, but the presumption that includes them and excludes illegitimate children on the same basis are presumptions that operate generally for the entire class and doesn’t allow any of them to offer proof of their particular situation, I believe, has an irrational effect."
1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,607.447,622.547,"In other words, if illegitimate -- if legitimate children did not -- were not required to prove the dependency status, but illegitimate children were, you would apparently have no trouble with that?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,622.547,634.179,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that, in fact, illegitimacy is a suspect classification and would request that this Court recognize illegitimacy as a suspect classification."
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,824.911,832.728,"Of course, in many states, illegitimate -- children who were born illegitimate can be legitimated through --"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,832.728,836.902,"That is true, Your Honor, but not at their own desire or control."
1973.72-6609,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,845.934,856.147,"Unlike race or sex or maybe other things, say, being born abroad for example, it’s not immutable to that extent at least?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,856.147,864.069,"It’s not as immutable, but to the degree -- in terms of the control of the person so-classified, it is immutable."
1973.72-6609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.554,877.768,"Well, of course by that standard, I suppose that a conscientious objector would argue that he has no control over his own status."
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,883.219,896.996,"I would think that that kind of conscious -- that the choice of one’s conscience is something that one has more control over, although you wouldn’t change it at a whim to obtain a benefit."
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,906.656,913.648,"Well, wouldn't the -- wouldn't the father have increased benefits if this child were legitimated?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,913.648,918.074,"If this child received benefits, the family all together would have -- the family in which --"
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,918.074,922.22,Perhaps I don’t understand the schemes.
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,931.019,932.716,The child would receive benefits.
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,932.716,933.718,"The child, is that it?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,933.718,934.018,That’s right.
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,934.018,937.768,"Well now, if this child were legitimated, would it now receive benefits?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,937.768,938.388,Yes.
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.388,939.0,It would?
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,939.0,946.434,"Yes, but there is no way that the child can be legitimated now because the mother of the child left the father years ago."
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,950.629,953.639,Could he adopt -- suppose he had adopted the child?
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,953.639,958.74,"It’s not certain that he could adopt the child, Your Honor, but he certainly -- he could attempt to adopt the child."
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,958.74,961.927,"Well, if he succeeded, would the child then be eligible?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,961.927,965.808,I think that the child would be eligible if he did that.
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,993.589,1005.522,"Well, that’s then to say that nothing can be done to make this child eligible for benefits if illegitimate at the time of the or born after the injury of the father that suffers?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,1005.522,1007.031,If he were not to adopt him?
1973.72-6609,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1007.031,1007.787,Yes.
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,1007.787,1010.995,Then there would be no other way except to remove this bar.
1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1012.13,1027.166,"But your view of what the Secretary would do in case of an adoption that is you suggest he would regard that as a manipulation, his view is certainly not an immutable view of the matter, is it?"
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,1027.166,1028.354,He’s -- the Secretary’s?
1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1028.354,1029.114,Yes.
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,1029.114,1031.374,"I hope not, Your Honor."
1973.72-6609,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1113.254,1116.692,Do legitimate children have much political power?
1973.72-6609,0,32941,jane_g_stevens,,1116.692,1124.123,"I think that they have more political power, Your Honor, because they aren’t discriminated against in this way."
1973.72-6609,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1257.117,1268.982,"Very well, Mrs. Stevens."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1278.648,1281.958,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1579.195,1585.119,Your point is no illegitimate children are excluded.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1588.562,1594.279,"Well, not -- no illegitimates, illegitimates who fail any one or all of those four tests."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1594.279,1601.573,Are any or all illegitimate children excluded up to this point at any space?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1601.573,1604.024,"Are all -- no, Your Honor."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1604.024,1607.662,"Well, why after the man becomes disabled did --"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1607.662,1608.005,Well --
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1608.005,1609.895,Did Congress do it?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1609.895,1631.237,"I would state, Your Honor, that the fact that the -- the line I was beginning was the real item which needs to be explained is not why we deny payments to these illegitimates because, by definition, since they were born after the man became disabled they could not have lost support due to his disability."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1686.957,1687.629,"Well, before--"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1687.629,1687.731,Yes.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.731,1690.279,Before the man becomes disabled?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1690.279,1691.408,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1691.408,1692.257,Right?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1692.257,1693.727,Before he becomes disabled.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1693.727,1704.537,There’s no distinction between illegitimate and legitimate children in that illegitimate children are not excluded per se.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1704.537,1706.156,Not per se.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1712.309,1713.437,Not per se.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1713.437,1714.102,For example--
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.102,1717.13,"And then once the man is injured, that all changes."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1717.13,1718.056,"No, sir."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1724.384,1725.641,Let’s leave dead out.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1727.124,1732.358,"Well, it’s not in this case but I would suggest briefly, Your Honor, that if --"
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1732.358,1734.688,"Well is a man, once he --"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1734.688,1750.021,"If the rule suggested by counsel opposite were adopted which I take it would mean that any of these tests could be met after the entitling event, for example a paternity order after death would qualify a child."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.021,1752.958,I’m just -- on one narrow point.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1752.958,1753.773,"Alright, Your Honor."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1753.773,1763.865,"Once he becomes disabled, any illegitimate child born a moment after that is in bad shape."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1763.865,1766.185,"Well, Your Honor, it --"
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.185,1767.185,Right?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1767.185,1768.539,It depends on where he lives.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1769.178,1770.351,In Illinois.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1770.351,1774.107,"In Illinois, he has some difficulties, yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.107,1775.572,"Difficulties, why?[Laughter]"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1775.572,1776.048,"Well, yes, sir."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1776.048,1778.334,"Well, why?"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1778.334,1785.758,"Because, Your Honor, he cannot have lost any support as a result of the disability --"
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.758,1789.52,"Yes, but I’m referring to the point “on the day after.”"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1789.52,1797.625,"Well, Your Honor, I suggest that the Social Security law, as with many laws are replete with that type of line."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.025,1801.897,"Let me ask you, why?"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1801.897,1806.131,"And the reason, Your Honor, is that he cannot have lost any support."
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1815.581,1817.617,But that would be true of a legitimate child as well?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1817.617,1818.576,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1825.18,1826.884,Alright.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1826.884,1834.442,So that this -- this we believe is not simply a discrimination between a legitimate and an illegitimate.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1850.171,1858.72,What about the discrimination between the illegitimate child born a day before and illegitimate child born a day after?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1858.72,1873.202,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that on the face of that distinction that there is no equal protection argue -- no equal protection problem with that, that that arises in any type of line drawing proposition."
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2159.269,2176.076,"Mr. Boggs, the District Court in this case upheld that this legislation solely, as I read its opinion upon the proposition that is designed to prevent fraud."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2178.306,2189.951,"That’s the primary basis on which it relied, perhaps the only basis on which they relied, whether -- I, in fact, don’t know whether the argument we’re presenting here was presented in that complexity to that --"
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2189.951,2192.629,"No, I’m referring just to their opinion, to the court’s opinion."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2192.629,2196.25,"Yes, I’m saying that that’s what one could gather from their opinion."
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2196.25,2201.682,"And you haven’t spent -- maybe I missed it, you haven’t devoted much time on your argument to that."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2201.682,2209.886,"No, we -- I would say that we tried to present what we believe is the strongest argument for upholding it, which is the one that we have presented to day."
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2268.237,2282.94,"Well, except I think that you’ve agree that the justification for legislation that would be based upon the support not having been available prior the event has nothing to do with legitimacy or illegitimacy."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2285.835,2286.518,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2286.518,2291.259,"And, therefore, that certainly doesn’t support this legislation, does it?"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2301.056,2301.689,"Right, he does not --"
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2301.689,2307.534,"-- by definition because he hasn’t been in existence, he fully shares under the statute?"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2307.534,2313.299,"He does not recover, however, because of his lost support at the time of the disability."
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2319.59,2320.76,But he gets --
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2320.76,2322.806,I would suggest --
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2322.806,2337.317,"But if the hypothesis is that he’s never had any support, never had any expectation or fact of support since he wasn’t in existence and hadn’t been born that cuts across legitimate and illegitimate children."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2346.044,2346.777,"Well, Your Honor --"
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.777,2347.423,That fact--
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2347.423,2351.956,"I take it that you’re then saying that, it would appear to me that --"
1973.72-6609,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2351.956,2352.635,I’m just asking you.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2352.635,2376.842,"Okay, we would indicate that -- as we pointed out in talking about the 1939 Amendments, at that time, persons who could have gotten money from the parent’s estate, that possible benefit was taken away and instead life payments were made as a substitute for that."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.006,2412.239,"What happens after he dies, with the illegitimate child?"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2412.239,2416.531,"Your Honor, a death benefit would be paid."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.22,2460.275,"So, they do inherit money, these illegitimate children?"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2460.275,2460.985,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.492,2466.358,They get it after death?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2466.358,2468.294,"No, they receive continuing benefits."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2468.395,2469.45,After death?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2469.45,2470.044,"Yes, they receive --"
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.044,2472.296,The illegitimate children?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2472.296,2473.772,If he met one of these tests.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.772,2477.932,"Right, but they can get it before death, right?"
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2477.932,2479.135,Because between --
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.135,2483.671,"No, because of the inheritance law."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2483.671,2484.313,No.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.313,2485.809,"Well, that’s what you just said."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2485.809,2486.716,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.716,2490.979,You said the reason you didn’t give the illegitimate children was because they couldn’t inherit.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2496.256,2511.398,"That’s the reason they do not receive that particular kind of benefit, but for example, if they were not acknowledged or if he was not contributing to them, they would not receive the death benefits either."
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2511.398,2514.071,"These children -- well, I just want my facts straight."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2514.071,2514.278,Alright.
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.278,2516.087,These children here --
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2516.087,2517.01,Eugenio and Alicia --
1973.72-6609,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2517.01,2522.474,"If they’re alive or if this man dies, they will get Social Security benefits."
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2526.45,2530.691,"If his actions to date constitute an acknowledgment, they would."
1973.72-6609,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2668.439,2669.096,Mr. Boggs.
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2669.096,2670.459,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-6609,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2670.459,2676.7,Does Illinois require the father or an illegitimate child to support it?
1973.72-6609,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,2676.7,2678.024,I believe that it does.
1973.72-6609,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2758.958,2759.852,"Thank you, Mr. Boggs."
1973.72-6609,2,32941,jane_g_stevens,,2765.82,2766.938,May it please the Court.
1973.72-6609,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2964.481,2965.869,"Thank you, Mrs. Stevens."
