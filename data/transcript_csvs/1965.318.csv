1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,312.037,318.587,"Roughly around 200 miles of there about, Your Honor."
1965.318,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,441.637,445.087,Well is that -- that the Senate that you’re speaking of?

1965.318,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,448.697,454.918,How do all those districts come out to population wise?
1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,454.918,461.207,They vary of course from -- depending on the size of the district.
1965.318,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,524.27,532.901,You mean there is 12 -- there is 12 to 1 ratio between the largest and the smallest?
1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,532.901,534.176,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.318,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,534.176,535.89,Right.

1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,550.778,552.147,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct."
1965.318,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,552.147,552.499,Right.
1965.318,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,552.499,564.384,"The largest of 60,000 with the six members so that's 10,000 each and the other only has one member and that's 5,000, isn't that right?"
1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,564.384,573.419,"Yes, but the reason for that is that the apportionment is on the basis of registered voters rather than population."
1965.318,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,591.139,593.559,That you [Inaudible]

1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,609.948,610.156,Yes.
1965.318,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,635.759,652.207,But do you -- do you attack the apportionment of the House as being not according to population or do you do it merely because it's inseparable from the -- the apportionment of the Senate?
1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,652.207,665.618,"We attack it primarily undergoing that is inseparable from the apportionment of the Senate, but we do proceed further and say, that registered voters which is the measure used here in and of itself is not a permissible measure."
1965.318,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,665.618,680.362,"Yes, but -- but if we -- if we should determine that it could be on a -- on a voters -- registered voters basis, would there be a malapportionment in the House of Representatives?"
1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,680.362,724.193,"We are not pushing that contention, Your Honor, because of the -- we believe that the -- assuming that the method of equal proportions is a valid method that by the way is method used in the House -- House of Representatives of the Congress unless one of the provisions in the Constitution as if -- is that (A) the number of registered voters in a district can go below a figure which is less than one-half the average number of registered voters per representative."

1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,787.68,789.254,Qualifications for registering to vote?
1965.318,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,789.254,792.094,And less than [Inaudible]
1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,792.094,805.416,No there are no property qualifications but we do have a problem with as far as the military are concerned as to their eligibility to register.
1965.318,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,805.416,815.093,With that the -- a citizen may have which is a register [Inaudible] can register without adding to the -- take an attempt?
1965.318,0,17782,bertram_t_kanbara,,815.093,815.321,No.

1965.318,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2638.05,2643.277,They do not have permanent personal registration as I understand this.
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,4850.316,4853.764,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5279.099,5280.14,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5390.733,5393.825,How many units?
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5393.825,5403.564,"There's a unit known as the cool out before the eighth district representative district, that's the district called Waialua and there's the District of Ewa."

1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5425.008,5425.806,"Yes, they are."
1965.318,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5425.806,5426.857,-- in different ways but they are related.
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5426.857,5427.962,Yes.
1965.318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5463.906,5469.387,"On the districts on Oahu, how many are single-member districts and how many are multi-member?"
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5469.387,5474.1,"For the Senate, there is no single-member district on the Island of Oahu."
1965.318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5489.882,5491.061,They were all multi-member districts?
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5491.061,5492.287,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5492.287,5493.32,For both houses.

1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5503.735,5507.163,"The single-member district, we do have on the Island of Hawaii."
1965.318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5508.509,5511.007,But that's for the house -- this is for the house.
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5511.007,5511.451,Yes.
1965.318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5511.451,5513.413,They are multi-member for the Senate here --
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5513.413,5513.859,That's correct.

1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5565.317,5573.264,I believe Your Honor that if the Constitution of convention of the legislature desires to create single-member districts.
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5579.776,5584.059,"What island would that be, that would be Lanai?"
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5584.059,5586.463,I'm afraid the population is too small for Lanai.
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5586.463,5587.565,I see.
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5587.565,5588.952,And so of the Molokai.
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5588.952,5589.448,Molokai.
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5589.448,5593.098,Combined together they would form one representative district.

1965.318,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5653.671,5658.098,But the population of that county is high?
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5665.84,5670.631,"I don't know if I have the figures written by hand, Your Honor but it is in the record."
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5670.631,5678.886,"Before you go on, may I ask you, what administrative units you referred to?"
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5682.289,5692.575,The administrative units generally confers in a large area except on the Island of Oahu.
1965.318,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5705.417,5708.168,For what -- for what purposes for example?
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5708.168,5712.339,"For example, at the present time, it has been used as a judicial district."
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5712.339,5713.207,Use as what?
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5713.207,5714.272,A judicial district.
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5714.272,5719.387,Judicial district.
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5719.387,5742.361,"Because I believe Your Honor that even if it is shown that the construction of the various senatorial and representative districts maybe arbitrary, we must still come back to this basic question as to whether or not it has in fact operated to cancel out or dilute the vote of any voter and we submit that there has been no showing in this respect."
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5915.495,5921.771,"Would you mind stating that again please, his statement in his reply brief?"
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5921.771,5939.735,"In the reply brief, the Governor makes the statement that if all of the districts, all of the multi-member districts elect an equal number of Representatives and Senators that there would be an equal submergence of minority in all the districts and therefore, it would not be objectionable."
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5939.735,5948.896,"Even though -- even though, some of the districts were one representative districts?"
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5948.896,5954.628,I believe the Governor was addressing himself to multi-member districts.
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5954.628,5954.923,Yes.
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5954.923,5955.511,In other words --
1965.318,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5955.511,5969.009,"But if some were -- if some were single districts and some multi districts but the -- all the multi districts were two, let's say, do I understand that your statement is that -- then there would be no objection?"
1965.318,2,46693,yukio_naito,,5969.009,5973.331,"That is my dissenting in reading your supply brief, Your Honor."

1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6172.058,6181.441,-- there is a tabulation of the military population in Hawaii since 1940 I believe.
1965.318,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6181.441,6181.908,Alright.
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6181.908,6188.723,"In any event, I would like to just pick out a few of the population figures to show that fluctuation."
1965.318,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6249.545,6255.733,Does this include the civil service employees of the armed forces or just a men in uniform?
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6255.733,6258.418,This is just a men in uniform.
1965.318,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6258.418,6265.083,And not the transient workers in the civil service of the Government?
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6265.083,6270.153,"No, not on this -- this is just the -- any new point."
1965.318,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6270.153,6274.304,Is there any -- any statistic on that that you have?
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6274.304,6274.99,As to the --
1965.318,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6274.99,6276.07,Civil service.
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6276.07,6276.786,"No, I don't Your Honor."
1965.318,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6276.786,6278.106,You don't have.
1965.318,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6278.106,6285.991,"Well, I notice that 389, civilian employees in the armed forces, would that be right?"
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6296.831,6298.386,"Yes, Your Honor and I believe that this is --"
1965.318,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6298.386,6302.901,"Yes, but -- but that's the only data of which we have that figure?"
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6302.901,6304.18,"To my knowledge, yes sir."
1965.318,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6304.18,6312.932,"And what's this other one, other employed civilians 217,000, who are they?"
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6312.932,6315.675,I'm not familiar with that Your Honor.
1965.318,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6315.675,6324.172,And you don't know whether that figure of civilian employees of the Armed Forces has a fluctuation which matches out of the military personnel?
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6324.172,6335.159,"No, Your Honor."
1965.318,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6589.637,6597.445,"Do I understand correctly that some of these people, military personnel and their dependents are registered voters, aren't' they?"
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6597.445,6599.019,Yes.
1965.318,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6599.019,6610.303,Any other -- are there any figures in your brief sort of kind of to what percentage of the military establishment there and their dependents are -- are registered voters?
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6610.303,6624.107,"I don't believe we have the record for the military dependents, but I believe the military -- the registration for the military was somewhere in the neighbor of -- neighborhood of about 43%."
1965.318,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6624.107,6628.134,Of the total military?
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6628.134,6645.074,"Just a minute, let me check that."
1965.318,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6668.056,6676.216,How long does a person has to reside in the Hawaii before he is qualified to become a registered voter?
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6676.216,6679.492,He must have resided in the islands for one year.
1965.318,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6679.492,6680.136,One year.
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6680.136,6681.564,Yes.
1965.318,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6681.564,6684.205,The military man along with the others.
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6684.205,6707.423,Well there's a -- Mr. Lyons was speaking earlier about the military who lives on post who has never been a resident of the -- of Hawaii before he went on to the post and he's forced to live on the post is not eligible to become a registered voter.
1965.318,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6707.916,6710.469,From the time he gets there?
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6710.469,6713.277,That's right.
1965.318,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6750.971,6753.592,Shall be deemed to have lost his residence –-
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6753.592,6757.744,"Gained or lost, simply because of his presence."
1965.318,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6757.744,6758.907,Gain or lost.
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6758.907,6781.059,"Yes and the Supreme Court of the United States -- Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii has held that in military personnel who is force to live on the post, does not establish residence -- cannot establish residence."
1965.318,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6781.059,6800.377,"Mr. Funaki, is there anything in the record to indicate that the State of Hawaii has in anyway discriminated against military men in voting as distinguished from the citizens?"
1965.318,3,30380,james_t_funaki,,6800.377,6806.321,"No, there's nothing in – there is – there is -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1965.318,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7220.209,7226.152,Mr. Dodge.
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7226.152,7231.661,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7725.903,7736.038,"Mr. Dodge, What -- how are your -- how is the registered voter in your State?"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7736.038,7737.572,In terms of how can a --
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7737.572,7739.982,How do you know how many registered voters there are?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7739.982,7745.647,Because there is a -- there is a central -- each county registers to voters.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7748.21,7750.114,You have permanent register -- you have permanent register.
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7750.114,7751.108,Yes we do.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7751.291,7753.159,And how often do you purge?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7753.159,7753.899,Pardon?
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7753.899,7757.374,How often do you purge your registration?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7757.374,7762.533,"Actually, we have permanent registration if you vote in each general election."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7766.313,7770.441,"Well, I know but for purposes that what if you don't vote?"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7773.323,7779.491,"Well, if the person dies between general election he is still on -- on the role after his death --"
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7779.491,7784.814,So how -- how do you tell then how many registered voters were are actually alive?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7784.814,7788.061,"Well, you -- I don't suppose you do, Your Honor."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7788.061,7789.994,"Well, quite a few people die every year?"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7790.322,7792.69,"Well, that's -- that's true."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7797.832,7800.207,"Well, how -- how does it go off?"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7800.207,7804.619,"Well, it's -- it's taken off because there is a -- there's a cross checking system, a card file so that you --"
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7804.619,7807.341,"So, you have a purge every election."
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7807.341,7808.027,Yes.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7816.426,7821.268,So you are really -- what you are really saying is that registered voters is not your major at all.
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7824.033,7826.919,"Well, we call it registered voters and it's -- it's making a number --"
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7826.919,7831.417,"Well, no, no, it's a number and because if you haven't voted, you're off the list."
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7831.417,7834.311,"That's -- that's -- that's true, when you're not counted as a registered voter."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7834.311,7839.264,So -- so you're -- so what you're saying is if actual voter is a test.
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7839.264,7861.965,"Well, the Constitution doesn't really say that the -- there was the debate in the constitutional convention as to whether to take total population or to take registered voters or to take votes cast for the Governor in the last general election and it was decided that the most current figure that you could get would be registered voter."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7861.965,7872.327,"Well, but you say there's no difference between registered voters and actual voters because if you don't register -- if you don't vote, you're off to registration list which just leaves the registered voters who voted."
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7872.327,7877.366,"Well, I suppose that I'm not -- I'm not saying that actual voters --"
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7877.366,7879.461,Is there a difference between the two or not?
1965.318,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7879.461,7884.095,"Well, I always get the addition of new -- people registering as voters?"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7884.095,7885.102,I'm sorry sir?
1965.318,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7885.102,7887.999,You don't always get the addition of the new people who are registered.
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7887.999,7889.068,Yes.
1965.318,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7889.068,7890.952,As well as those who voted?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7890.952,7903.651,"Certainly, the comparison between registered voters and actual voters particularly in view of the fact that 89% and 92% of our voters actually vote, and our registered voters actually vote in Hawaii."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7909.227,7916.87,Now if you're talking about -- you're talking about the percentage of voters who are registered voters who are alive to vote.
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7916.87,7930.54,"Well, I'm sorry there isn't anything in the record to indicate how many there might be who had died between general elections and would still be a registered voter until the end of the elections."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7934.705,7938.583,And how often is the -- is the apportionment basis be determined?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7938.583,7938.675,Every 10 years.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7938.675,7940.159,Every 10 years?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7945.74,7966.654,We're talking about the number of registered voters of the general election preceding the time that the Governor -- in Hawaii the apportionment is a ministerial act by the Governor every 10 years and we're talking then about the previous general election registration of statistics.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7966.654,7972.892,Are you talking about the ones who are eligible to vote of that general election where the people actually voted the [Inaudible]
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7972.892,7980.338,We're talking about the total number that was carried under personal roles as being registered to vote for that general election.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7982.982,7988.5,"And the only ones you would carry though are the ones who voted in the last, preceding elections."
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,7988.5,7989.291,"Yes, that's right."
1965.318,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7989.736,7993.393,"Well, they didn't register, didn't they?"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8001.122,8003.297,You could register the day after the election.
1965.318,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8003.297,8005.69,"Well, many of these people may or did not vote."
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8006.492,8015.485,"Well, we have a table in -- in -- it appears with the last -- the next to the last page, it's --"
1965.318,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8015.485,8017.293,In your briefs?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8017.293,8024.936,"No, it's intervener's plaintiffs Exhibit GO4, appearing on page 409 of the printed record."
1965.318,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,8057.869,8060.638,Which one you have told would you think the two-thirds in that?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8060.638,8061.515,I'm sorry sir.
1965.318,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,8061.515,8068.628,Which total would you take on the reapportionment 239?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8071.421,8073.146,"No, to reapportion -- to reapportion."
1965.318,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8095.471,8117.561,"Well I suppose that you'd have somewhat the same situation that you based -- based your representation on population because there would be a lot of people who die, people go away, and so forth so that would affect it as much as -- as those who don't vote."
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8117.561,8123.819,"Well my point, Mr. Chief Justice is not that you might get the same situation."
1965.318,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8202.272,8210.741,"Why should total population that definition of that word of that term have to include military, if you say they're temporary?"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8210.741,8215.245,I don't think it does have to include it.
1965.318,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8227.664,8230.636,"But frequently, is that understood in the [Inaudible]"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8230.636,8232.186,Well this isn't my --
1965.318,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8232.186,8236.115,"Minors, children --"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8236.115,8236.636,Well certainly --
1965.318,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8236.636,8238.025,People who are unable to vote --
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8238.025,8240.329,They have -- they have -- they have an interest.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8428.689,8430.436,Do you think the District Court below is right?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8430.436,8430.941,Pardon.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8430.941,8432.89,Do you think the District Court was right?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8432.89,8433.76,"Oh, yes!"
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8472.843,8475.35,But if it has an act of plan [Inaudible]
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8475.35,8480.717,As its -- as the District Court's order and I think that was understood by all parties to the suit.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8480.717,8482.978,And without any reference to [Inaudible]
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8482.978,8484.523,That's right.
1965.318,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8545.226,8548.318,How long does it take to convene the Constitution provision?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8548.318,8550.591,"Well, our -- it's a little complicated."
1965.318,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8558.511,8562.697,"-- the election, according to the legislature of reapportionment?"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8562.697,8579.176,"The election of the -- the Constitution says that unless the legislature otherwise provides, the delegates will be elected in the same manner as they were in 1950 which is not completely on a population and registered voter basis, but it gives the Island of Oahu adjourning to delegates."
1965.318,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8605.174,8606.477,After a year?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8606.477,8607.768,Yes. Yes.
1965.318,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8607.768,8610.205,Is that a liberal allowance or is that minimum?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8610.205,8610.441,"Oh, no."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8613.249,8618.91,"You could mean that as of now, one it stayed effect until the early of 1958."
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8618.91,8619.82,That's right.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8620.61,8622.721,Without the legislative election this year.
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8622.721,8626.231,"We have legislative elections this year, a third of the Senate and all of the House."
1965.318,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,8639.233,8641.134,Do you have primary?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8641.134,8641.769,Pardon?
1965.318,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,8641.769,8643.317,Do you have primaries?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8643.317,8644.226,"Yes, we do."
1965.318,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,8646.228,8648.466,That would be October?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8648.466,8648.964,October.
1965.318,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,8651.271,8653.967,You have had reapportionment before October.
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8653.967,8659.465,"Yes, that's correct and I don't really think there's time to do it."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8731.068,8739.779,"Let's assume that -- let's assume that the Court accepted the registered voter basis, accepted the multi-member district."
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8747.329,8747.819,"Well, I would think that --"
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8747.819,8748.826,What's the purpose?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8748.826,8751.591,I would think it would go back down to the District Court.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8768.595,8769.539,"Well, what if the --"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8769.539,8769.959,-- right away.
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8769.959,8787.649,What if the Court thought that registered voters was a matter of the basis for apportionment that the multi-member districts were all right and that the plan to vote by the legislature was alright constitutionally?
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8787.649,8794.522,"Well, then I would suppose that you'd suggest to the District Court that it entered that as a part of each order for 1966 election."
1965.318,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8794.522,8814.04,"Well, in order that -- in order that the legislature that would be dealing with -- that would be proposing a constitutional amendment or a legislature that would be convening in constitutional convention would be the legislature elected in the district interim --"
1965.318,4,39052,robert_g_dodge,,8814.04,8815.472,Newly apportionment.
1965.318,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8823.801,8831.749,Mr. Marumoto.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,8831.749,8835.352,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8962.87,8969.82,[Inaudible] that this ought to be a permanent one on the Act where a Constitution [Inaudible]
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,8969.82,8975.195,I agree with that and then I may -- I may enter certain questions.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9047.564,9050.076,"Well, could it -- could it pass it at a budget basis?"
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9050.076,9056.74,It can as an urgent measure and no question it is an urgent measure.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9067.712,9072.751,Is that a calendar with two-thirds but it maybe passed by a majority since it is passed by a [Inaudible]
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9072.751,9073.623,That is right.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9082.381,9087.169,"Well, [Inaudible] if that happens what goes to the general election."
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9093.59,9099.696,A question as to whether there shall be a constitutional session convention has already been passed.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9107.396,9108.033,I'm sorry.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9123.164,9125.469,"There will be two, two questions."
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9153.502,9155.514,"Adoption is what, the constitutional amendment?"
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9155.514,9156.811,Constitutional amendment.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9156.811,9160.179,"So if it is ratified at the November election, that will --"
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9160.179,9161.452,Yes.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9161.452,9165.043,"Then and there at this general election, amend your Constitution, is that it?"
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9165.043,9179.655,"That is right and if the voters reject that question, the plan proposed by the legislature and if it passes the other question, shall there be a convention?"
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9190.532,9191.345,Then what?
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9191.345,9197.324,There will be constitutional convention anyway and then one -- one problem about limiting the constitutional --
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9197.324,9203.359,Actually then -- then you have a constitutional amendment and then you'll have a constitutional convention which may adopt still a different amendment.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9203.359,9222.508,"That is right and one difficulty with having a constitutional convention is under our Constitution, the agenda of the constitutional convention cannot be limited so that the convention may go all over the creation."
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9222.508,9224.193,You may get a complete new composition.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9224.193,9224.614,That is right.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9224.614,9230.638,And what about -- what about the composition of the convention is that of the same basis on just how to present it?
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9230.638,9258.172,"The statute which creates the Constitutional convention, under our Constitutional -- under the provision states that it maybe the same number as in the 1952 convention or the legislature which creates -- which calls for this convention may adopt a different apportionment."
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9268.88,9284.807,"Yes, but this -- this particular -- this matter of the constitutional convention -- when is the -- let's assume that this is -- this constitutional convention matter is passed --"
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9284.807,9285.214,Yes.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9285.214,9286.012,-- or is adopted --
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9286.012,9286.313,Yes.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9286.313,9287.902,-- and is followed.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9293.288,9294.938,The Legislature Act.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9299.903,9310.098,"Yes, but the -- but the composition, has that -- is that part of the submission in November or is that has to be decided after the people approve the Constitutional convention."
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9310.098,9312.881,That will be under article --
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9312.881,9314.539,That hasn't already been decided.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9314.539,9316.513,It has not yet been decided.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9359.549,9367.392,-- you sure legislate your Hawaii Legislature has not yet provided for the composition of the convention --
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9367.392,9368.214,No.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9368.214,9369.559,-- which maybe approved.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9369.559,9370.117,No.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9373.073,9386.15,"And if it -- and if it does, do something in the January 1967 session, as I understood you, what it does cannot include a limitation to consideration by the convention only of apportionment."
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9386.15,9387.517,No.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9419.643,9422.762,"But you just assume to see that wide open, is that it?"
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9422.762,9424.692,I think so.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9509.446,9513.007,"On what page did you say, Mr. Marumoto in your brief?"
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9513.007,9514.613,On page 15 of my brief.
1965.318,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9514.613,9516.8,Thank you.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9516.8,9533.44,I have adverted to the tenth district and the eleventh district only and main district have about all the military installation which kept the [Inaudible] in these districts and then it went on.
1965.318,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9634.775,9636.546,This is all over the island.
1965.318,5,36361,masaji_marumoto,,9636.546,9637.444,All over the island.
1965.318,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10269.478,10277.788,Thank you.
1965.318,6,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,10281.488,10283.66,May it please the Court.
1965.318,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10370.857,10383.112,"Mr. Lyons, if -- if -- what if we disagreed with you, you have to show what -- what if we suggest that you have the burden showing what was wrong with the -- having a display."
1965.318,6,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,10383.718,10392.585,"Well, I think we've shown first that there is this great disparity and we've said that there is no consistent pattern."
1965.318,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10393.495,10400.225,And then what's wrong within -- in a consistent pattern as such -- just because when district start creating another two and another one?
1965.318,6,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,10400.225,10407.951,"Well, if there were some single standard that was applied to construct them all that would be a consistent pattern."
1965.318,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10417.95,10419.884,"Well, what's wrong -- what's wrong with that?"
1965.318,6,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,10419.884,10436.473,"Well, it's completely an arbitrary determination of whether or not represented by six people or represented by one person who makes that depends strictly on geographic considerations which we believe this Court has taught us impermissible."
1965.318,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10436.473,10447.453,Do you think this Court has said that it's inherently arbitrary for one person to be represented by one Congressman and -- or one Representative and another person to be represented by six?
1965.318,6,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,10447.453,10449.214,Not that it's inherently arbitrary.
1965.318,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10452.778,10453.157,"Yes, but --"
1965.318,6,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,10453.157,10462.48,Unless there is some rational basis on which that could be done I would contend that it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and there is no rational basis for that.
1965.318,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10462.48,10469.51,All you have said is that there are various districts and various members of representatives (Voice Overlap) arbitrary?
1965.318,6,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,10469.51,10473.421,And if there's no consistent pattern as to determine how many have hwat.
1965.318,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10503.501,10504.269,Very well.
