1983.83-328,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.118,We will hear arguments next in Mabry against Johnson.
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,84.634,99.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the state appears here as a petitioner because of the importance it attaches to the resolution of this case on its merits due to the split in the circuits and that impact on the criminal justice system."
1983.83-328,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,117.022,118.641,But after his acceptance.
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,118.641,120.659,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,152.88,156.832,"Under Arkansas law, who makes the final decision on sentences?"
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,156.832,157.782,"The trial court, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,157.782,161.902,And on the acceptance of pleas?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,161.902,168.89,"The trial court, Your Honor, would consider the plea offer that was made, and would decide whether it was acceptable and either accept it or not."
1983.83-328,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,168.89,171.008,He can reject it if he wishes?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,171.008,173.877,"Yes, sir, the trial court may reject the offer."
1983.83-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.708,308.563,"General Clark, is the defendant now released from custody?"
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,308.563,309.832,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.182,313.967,And served how much time?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,313.967,322.64,"Defendant was sentenced in 1970 and '71, and was released in 1977, I believe... '79, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.64,328.877,And the sentence he had been given was a total of how many years?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,328.877,337.25,"For the charge of burglary and assault with intent to kill, 21 years for burglary and 12 for assault with intent to kill, and that was the sentence he was served."
1983.83-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.909,364.55,"In Arkansas, does a plea agreement have to be entered into in writing ultimately before it is put into effect?"
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,364.55,366.169,"There is not a requirement in the state statute, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.169,370.387,But it does have to be approved by the judge?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,370.387,376.775,The trial court must approve any plea that has been offered to a defendant.
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,406.377,409.512,Where was that in Santobello that there was reliance on--
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,409.512,411.531,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,411.531,418.887,--You said that the defendant in Santobello had relied on the plea bargaining.
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,418.887,419.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.72,420.303,Is that in the opinion?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,420.303,422.255,The defendant relied by entering a plea of guilty.
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,422.255,425.141,"But it is not in the... the opinion doesn't say that, does it?"
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,425.141,428.576,"Your Honor, as I understand the facts, the defendant did enter a plea of guilty."
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,428.576,430.259,"The opinion doesn't say that, does it?"
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,430.259,431.278,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,431.278,431.945,It does?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,431.945,432.611,It does say that.
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,433.813,435.03,It says that he relied on it?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,435.03,436.765,He relied by virtue of entering a plea of guilty.
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,436.765,439.716,And that that prejudiced him?
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,439.716,440.35,That shows that reliance.
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,454.024,459.178,We are talking about the bargaining between the man and the prosecutor.
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,459.178,459.995,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,459.995,467.801,"That is what Santobello is about, and that is what this case is about, and I'm not too sure Santobello helps you that much."
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,467.801,475.474,"Your Honor, I would submit to you that Santobello does help in the sense that unless the defendant shows there has been some detrimental reliance or some prejudice."
1983.83-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.522,566.983,"General Clark, the Court of Appeals seems to have concluded that the writ of habeas corpus should issue unless the state resentenced the defendant in accordance with the concurrent sentence plea proposal."
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,575.672,578.189,"Your Honor, I do not know why they did not."
1983.83-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.941,617.582,"But what if the Court of appeals, instead of saying what it did, it said, until the state submits the plea bargain to the judge who tried the case, saying the prosecutor is bound but not the trial judge."
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,621.284,622.57,"Yes, Your Honor, it is still objectionable."
1983.83-328,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.813,750.853,"General Clark, just so I understand your position, in this particular case you say it would have been silly to make this offer, because it really was no punishment at all."
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,750.853,751.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,751.536,760.525,But you would make the same constitutional argument if they had offered him 15 years instead of life or something like 15 years consecutive and then later changed their mind and decided it ought to be 21 years consecutive.
1983.83-328,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,760.525,765.179,"Yes, sir, I would make the same argument if you withdraw the plea if no prejudice had attached, there had been no detrimental reliance."
1983.83-328,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1063.74,1064.873,Very well.
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1079.667,1082.417,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1171.824,1185.817,"In your view of Arkansas law, at what point could the defendant have withdrawn his participation and said, I have changed my mind, I want to go to trial?"
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1185.817,1186.35,Any time.
1983.83-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1186.35,1187.867,Any time up to when?
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1187.867,1203.112,"As I understand it, certainly any time up through the entry of his plea of guilty, and in fact I think under the current rules in Arkansas he could move to withdraw his plea after the plea had been tendered but before sentence had been passed by the court."
1983.83-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.112,1214.385,May I ask if your emphasis on detrimental reliance and prejudice means that it is sort of an estoppel theory?
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1219.455,1225.275,"Well, it could be put in those terms."
1983.83-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.452,1241.904,"And there has to be a right at stake, I guess."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1244.689,1257.764,"--Frankly, in terms of the constitutional vocabulary, to move aside from the contract law, it seems to me that you have to have a question about the knowing and voluntary waiver of a right."
1983.83-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.923,1274.225,"See, detrimental reliance is not normally an element of waiver."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1281.962,1292.587,"Well, we keep changing tracks in terms of the legal vocabulary used here between the constitutional law analysis and the contract law analysis."
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1312.916,1316.285,Is there any doubt that this man did rely on it?
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1316.285,1320.939,--There is... It is absolutely clear that this man did not rely on that?
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.939,1322.872,That he didn't rely on that agreement?
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1322.872,1323.808,Did not rely on the agreement.
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.295,1334.514,What did he do to show he didn't rely on it?
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1334.514,1339.584,--He did nothing to show that he did rely on it.
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1339.584,1342.936,"Well, I mean, he didn't do anything, did he?"
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1342.936,1344.053,He did nothing.
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1351.958,1355.577,"Now, if he had not gotten the deal, would he have done something?"
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1355.577,1357.529,If he had not gotten the deal?
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1357.529,1358.145,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1358.145,1362.933,He might have pleaded guilty to... He might have gone to trial.
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.933,1366.218,"He might have gone out to get some witnesses, too."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1366.218,1371.205,"He might have done any number of things, but he did nothing."
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1371.205,1379.526,"I don't see how you assume that when a man gets an agreement with the state, he relies on it, then he has to show in addition that he was injured by it."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1381.811,1385.881,"He would have to show some prejudice, but first he has to show--"
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1385.881,1386.599,What prejudice?
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1386.599,1396.487,--Some... that there was some right that he was entitled to have that he has lost because of the agreement.
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1396.487,1398.837,Some right?
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1401.522,1407.509,Not when you have an agreement that is not finalized until a court accepts it.
1983.83-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1409.545,1413.83,It has been made by a state official authorized to make--
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1438.564,1441.266,"In a situation where the defendant, of course, can back out at any time."
1983.83-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.266,1447.42,"--And that depends, as I understand your theory, on his showing that he is worse off than if the representation had never been made."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1452.488,1453.657,We don't have that here.
1983.83-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.526,1460.643,--But the minimum showing is some detriment.
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1467.333,1468.749,That is right.
1983.83-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.368,1474.653,The same essential ingredient is in any estoppel case.
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1474.653,1487.144,"--Ordinarily, there is not going to be that showing unless he has a plea, unless he has cooperated with the authorities."
1983.83-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1543.713,1556.105,Did I understand you to say that the defendant could have withdrawn his plea at any time or his whatever you want to call it at any time until the judge had accepted it and acted on it?
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1556.105,1570.048,"--That's correct, and there may even be provision... I would have to check this... under Arkansas law similar to under federal law that would allow him to move to vacate the plea thereafter, but that is correct."
1983.83-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1586.057,1594.813,"To the extent there is any reliance on the contract theory, then the contract theory would be that both are bound or neither is bound."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1594.813,1625.367,"Well, there is no meeting of the minds, that there has been no performance, not even partial performance, and in fact there is no mutuality of obligation, because what the Court of Appeals has done is to impose an obligation only on the government, the prosecution, to abide by even what in this case is really a ludicrous slip of the tongue to suggest that there would be a sentence that would give him no additional jail time for a murder that he had been previously convicted of."
1983.83-328,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1625.367,1636.573,"Mr. Ganzfried, I take it it would make no differences for purposes of your argument if the agreement had been reduced to writing by the parties."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1636.573,1638.092,That is correct.
1983.83-328,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1648.298,1661.791,"Well, I suppose these written agreements, at least in some jurisdictions, purport to give up those rights on the signing of the agreement, although it still is subject sometimes to approval by the court."
1983.83-328,1,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1661.791,1672.432,"Well, certainly in the federal courts, and in Arkansas as well, it is up to the court ultimately to decide whether that plea is acceptable and that bargain is acceptable."
1983.83-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.983,1726.733,Very well.
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1728.067,1731.285,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1768.227,1778.952,Do you agree with your friend that the defendant may withdraw at any time up to the time the Court acts on the plea and possibly even afterwards?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1778.952,1779.968,"I think that is true, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1817.327,1820.529,Do you mean twice as much in terms of adding the numbers--
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1820.529,1821.695,Yes.
1983.83-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1821.695,1824.164,--without reference to whether they are consecutive or concurrent?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1824.164,1833.587,"That is... well, in fact, the bargain, Your Honor, that was finally struck was that it would be 21 years consecutive as opposed to 21 years concurrent."
1983.83-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.16,1878.179,"You agree, then, that the trial judge was the final arbiter?"
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1878.179,1879.881,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1879.881,1893.939,Didn't the Eighth Circuit leave your client in a better position by its order than he would have been if the plea agreement had been accepted and the prosecutor had been forced to abide by the agreement?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1904.497,1907.949,"I think effectively speaking you are right, Your Honor."
1983.83-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.826,1929.695,"Well, but the Court of Appeals is applying constitutional principles."
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1955.362,1956.562,I think that's correct.
1983.83-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.562,1958.664,Do you feel you could justify that in any way?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1958.664,1970.955,"Yes, Your Honor, I think I can, because this case, even the habeas case has been pending a long time, and these facts are very stale, and my client has already served the enhanced agreement."
1983.83-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.061,1982.963,"That has nothing to do with the theory of your case, does it?"
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,1987.251,2003.326,"Well, I guess it is, in a sense, Your Honor, but of course I will say that this issue was not brought up to the Eighth Circuit, and therefore their opinion does not address it at all, and I am somewhat at a disadvantage to justify their thinking when I don't know that they ever thought it."
1983.83-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.862,2006.98,Do you think they wrote it but they didn't think it?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,2006.98,2021.907,"--Well, they did not address the issue of whether they can order specific performance and bypass what the trial judge might have done back in 1973, or actually '72, I'm sorry."
1983.83-328,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.785,2042.737,Ordinarily one finds the rationale in the opinion.
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,2042.737,2048.891,"I agree, Your Honor, but that was not an issue that was addressed by the parties or the Eighth Circuit."
1983.83-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.891,2061.949,"Mr. Quiggle, under Arkansas practice, if the agreement had been... there had been no misunderstanding and no change, and had been submitted to the court, would there have been a recommendation by the prosecutor that that be entered?"
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,2061.949,2073.006,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and the fact of the matter is, even unto this day trial courts in Arkansas routinely, if not... and consistently take those recommendations."
1983.83-328,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2272.469,2275.838,When was this told to the defendant?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,2275.838,2309.392,"--Your Honor, I don't think it was for some months, until after the plea was rejected, because it was set down for a hearing that was continued, and then they came back and had the mistrial that I mentioned just a second ago, and I believe that it was not until they commenced that trial that my client, Mr. Johnson, knew that the original offer had been rejected."
1983.83-328,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.392,2313.963,There is nothing in the record about it one way or the other?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,2313.963,2342.665,"It is not clear from the record, Your Honor, but I will say that the prosecutor, the deputy prosecutor who was assigned to the case after the plea was withdrawn by the state admitted that he did not contact Mr. Johnson until shortly before the time of the hearing where the mistrial occurred, and so I think presumably that encompasses the fact that he did not communicate the withdrawn plea."
1983.83-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2439.978,2451.334,"Well, in those circumstances, in terms of the impact, isn't the standard that you cannot assist him if you know he is testifying falsely?"
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,2451.334,2459.957,"I certainly think in the instance where a defendant, as here, would have to take the stand in order to make their case, I believe that it does--"
1983.83-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2459.957,2462.159,Would it be any different before or after?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,2462.159,2474.533,"--Well, Your Honor, I presume that before the defendant has not conceded his guilt to anyone, and in the face of these kinds of facts, in fact, the defendant has said, yes, I am guilty."
1983.83-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2474.533,2480.972,Are you suggesting that that would be the first time that the defense counsel became aware of the reality?
1983.83-328,2,40246,richard_quiggle,,2480.972,2492.78,"It certainly would probably be the first time under normal practice, I would think, Your Honor, that a defense counsel was told by the defendant literally, I am guilty."
1983.83-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2554.402,2555.271,Very well.
1983.83-328,3,29671,john_steven_clark,,2556.254,2557.723,"No, no further comments."
1983.83-328,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2557.723,2559.206,"Thank you, gentlemen."
