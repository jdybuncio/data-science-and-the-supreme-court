1986.85-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.206,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1520, Anderson against Creighton."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,65.191,68.91,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,280.314,283.933,"Mr. Pincus, would you repeat that last sentence again?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,283.933,291.121,"--Yes, sir, we do not seek a determination in this Court about whether or not the District Court properly granted summary judgment."
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.601,365.72,"Mr. Pincus, can I just interrupt you?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,447.99,449.84,"--Well, Your Honor, we think they certainly did they."
1986.85-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.977,460.881,"They didn't apply the... you don't say that they were wrong in saying that the legal standard was clearly established, do you?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,460.881,463.916,"--No, Your Honor, but we think they were wrong in saying that was the end of the inquiry."
1986.85-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.916,464.533,"Well, I know."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,477.776,480.977,"No, we in fact... we submit that further proceedings are entirely appropriate."
1986.85-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.977,488.317,"So Justice Stevens' point, you'd be very happy if we just said that... affirmed that there's more to it than that?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,488.317,502.891,"Yes, Your Honor, we'd be very happy if the Court did in this case just what it did in Malley v. Briggs, which is to point out what the ultimate question is on immunity, and then remand the case to allow the District Court to decide whether or not that standard has been met on the facts of this case."
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.891,507.962,So you want the judgment affirmed with an explanation of what the nature of the proceedings should be?
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,507.962,509.564,"Well, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,509.564,510.731,"I mean, the judgment is correct."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,510.731,511.764,--I guess we differ about what the view of the judgment is.
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.643,543.951,"But if you... if we wrote an opinion that said in determining whether he's entitled to qualified immunity, you've got to look at the facts as well as the legal standard, and therefore, the judgment is affirmed, you'd be happy with that?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,543.951,547.153,"Well, Your Honor, as long as the Court... I guess we just have a different--"
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,547.153,549.021,Explains what has to be done on the remand.
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,549.021,556.543,"--Yes, as long as what the Court of Appeals... as long as a portion of that judgment doesn't take the issue out of the case."
1986.85-1520,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,573.553,584.195,"Mr. Pincus, I understood your brief to request us to reverse the judgment because the Court applied an erroneous principle."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,587.997,588.747,"Well, Your Honor, I agree."
1986.85-1520,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,588.747,591.032,Was incorrectly framed.
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,591.032,597.519,"Our position is that the Court of Appeals' judgment was wrong, and that it has to be either vacated or reversed."
1986.85-1520,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,598.103,599.888,"Well, reversed or remanded."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,599.888,600.371,--Yes.
1986.85-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.221,681.94,"If that's really what we meant in Harlow, we really should have put it differently then, shouldn't we?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,708.757,722.834,"Well, we think that the question here is whether on the facts of this case it was clearly established that respondents had a right not to... for Officer Anderson not to conduct a warrantless search of their home."
1986.85-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,781.888,787.442,"Well, Mr. Pincus, what's wrong with Justice Scalia's formulation of the standard?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,819.597,820.247,"Yes, yes."
1986.85-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,870.228,881.036,The ACLU brief suggests that under your test it would get us back to a subjective inquiry in every case.
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,883.488,888.658,"Well, Your Honor, we don't think that a subjective inquiry will be necessary in every case."
1986.85-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.436,911.571,And objectively whether a reasonable well trained officer would--
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,911.571,913.423,"Yes, Your Honor, it's a two-step process."
1986.85-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.74,947.18,--But a particular defendant could not... the government officer could not prevail simply by testifying that he subjectively thought there was probable cause.
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,947.18,951.882,"No, the Court's made clear that that's irrelevant under the Fourth Amendment, and we think it would be irrelevant here."
1986.85-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.401,984.019,"Yes, but I don't see why you say it doesn't come up in the warrant context."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1002.481,1009.671,"Yes, sir, and I was just... I was responding to Justice O'Connor's question about whether a subjective... something that wasn't on an objective piece of paper would be required."
1986.85-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.942,1020.526,--You still have to inquire into his subjective judgment.
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1024.346,1030.0,"Yes, and that second question, the question about whether his judgment is reasonable, doesn't look to his judgment."
1986.85-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.892,1066.173,"There is a little bit of a romvoire situation when you're dealing with an area like the Fourth Amendment, that... the legal standards are those of a reasonable person, and then you get to the question of, even though they didn't satisfy that, could they satisfy the objective belief or objective view of another reasonable man."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1066.173,1070.542,"Well, it's true, and the ACLU and respondents do make that point in their brief."
1986.85-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1135.233,1149.142,"Mr. Pincus, if on remand, the Court applying the proper standard concludes that on these facts the action was not reasonable, will you be back?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1155.129,1170.572,"Well, Your Honor, obviously we think that Agent Anderson is entitled to immunity, and we think that under the proper standard, that's what the District Court and the Court of Appeals will hold."
1986.85-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.895,1292.787,"Well, what do you do about the argument that, at least when you're dealing with a probable cause question, the slack is already built in?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1307.212,1317.485,"Well, Your Honor, the problem with that argument is that the probable cause standard assumes that officers will be able to act up until the limit of where probable cause exists."
1986.85-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.018,1396.937,"There isn't any real necessity, though, to equate admissibility of evidence, where the aim is to deter illegal action, and you wouldn't deter anything where an officer could reasonably have believed he was satisfying probable cause and immunity questions--"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1396.937,1405.876,"Well, Justice White, the Court's immunity decisions rest on... rest on the policy determination that without immunity vigorous law enforcement will be chilled."
1986.85-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.566,1427.624,"--And officers are bound to do... anytime they honestly think there's probable cause, they feel duty bound to act, I suppose?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1432.527,1434.912,--If it's appropriate in the particular situation.
1986.85-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.73,1470.918,And you shouldn't... you shouldn't make them liable for damages because?
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1470.918,1477.589,Because that will necessarily chill them and make them reluctant to act unless they believe they have a margin for safety.
1986.85-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.415,1506.859,"But a good officer in the same position, he may have been stuck with damages the last time, but why wouldn't he act on the same facts or similar facts again, the same way?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1506.859,1521.284,"Well, Your Honor, an officer, we think, has an incentive to act according to the Constitution, just because that is the requirement of his office, A, and B, because the goal is to apprehend someone and convict them later."
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.384,1555.173,"Mr. Pincus, if we go back to the common law, wasn't the very purpose of the probable cause requirement to protect the officer from the danger of making mistakes, because we know he can't guess right every time?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1592.365,1598.935,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the Court has already made that determination in the Pierson v. Ray case quite well--"
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.935,1599.502,In a probable cause context?
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1599.502,1618.147,"--Well, in Malley v. Briggs, specifically, the Court said even where an officer applies for a warrant and the warrant does not... is not justified by probable cause, then the people who are arrested pursuant to the warrant later bring an action against the officer--"
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.147,1622.415,"Of course, there you have the intervention of a neutral and detached magistrate in that situation; but here you don't."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1622.415,1625.717,"--But the Court in Malley didn't rely on that rationale, and we think that the damages--"
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.717,1636.591,But you do agree that your view would give the law enforcement officers here an additional layer of protection over and above that which the probable cause determination originally gave them at common law?
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1636.591,1641.079,"--Well, Your Honor, I have to yield to you in my knowledge of what the common law does."
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.579,1643.947,What do you suppose the purpose of the probable cause requirement was?
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1643.947,1647.316,"--Well, it also provides for... it just protects the individual--"
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.316,1649.166,"In the warrantless area, in the warrantless context?"
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1649.166,1655.32,"--Under the Fourth Amendment, it protects the individual's privacy and other interests against random intrusion by the state."
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.855,1666.692,"But you're saying we should sacrifice that protection here, because the officer... I mean, you're saying they should have a lesser degree of protection here than they had at common law."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1666.692,1669.961,"--Well, Your Honor, there still is the legal standard... remains untouched."
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.909,1692.826,And the individual won 't be protected in that situation.
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1695.445,1697.48,"--Well, and we think that in Harlow--"
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.48,1704.8,"You're in effect saying that they should have less... the individuals have less protection than they had at common law, and the officer should have greater leeway than they would have at common law."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1704.8,1709.371,"--Well, Your Honor, the individual does not have less protection, the Fourth amendment standard remains unchanged."
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.49,1716.292,"You mean, after the search has been conducted, he can say, I know it was unconstitutional, but I can't do anything about it."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1717.324,1720.659,"Well, if he's a criminal defendant, he will be entitled to have a suppression hearing to raise that."
1986.85-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.659,1725.713,"Yes, but I think we're more concerned with the people who are not criminal defendants, as is the case in this case."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1728.915,1747.876,"Harlow and Malley, the Court has we think made that policy judgment and decided that independent and they be entitled to act unless their conduct is... unconstitutional."
1986.85-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.876,1768.206,"Well, maybe the common law standard for probable cause was quite more lenient than the standard we've developed in cases that are principally derived in the context of whether evidence will be excluded at a criminal trial, where its a lot easier to be more parsimonious about what constitutes probable cause."
1986.85-1520,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1768.206,1777.146,"Well, Your Honor, we think that that may well be true, where the judge is not faced with the question of whether a police officer is going to be answerable in damages for his conduct."
1986.85-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.852,1786.918,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,1792.321,1795.607,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.17,1933.209,You say then that immunity is applicable or available only when there's been a change in the law?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,1933.209,1946.536,"--The... yes, Your Honor, that would be our position, that it would be a new development or a novel application in the qualified immunity area dealing with the area outside the warrants."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1946.536,1949.405,Do you think that's reconcilable with Malley?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,1949.405,1954.106,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, and this is how it is reconcilable with Malley."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.068,1971.618,"Well, but Malley was an action for damages, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,1974.27,1975.722,"That's true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.645,2014.513,But there was surely no doubt about the law in Malley.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2022.369,2023.736,"Yes, you did, Your Honor."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.559,2076.485,"xxx I take it that you say that the immunity should... where the law is clearly established, and it's just an argument about the validity of the application of the Fourth Amendment, immunity just has to turn on what the ultimate decision is on whether there's been a violation of the Fourth Amendment."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2076.485,2078.937,"--In the Fourth Amendment context, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.937,2093.946,"Now that's so even if, say, the Fifth Circuit divides eight to seven and it comes up here and we divide five to four, and four Justices think there was no violation and five Justices do."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2107.956,2109.323,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1520,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2164.376,2181.771,"Well, it's possible, I suppose, that the standard of reasonableness for a substantive Fourth Amendment violation could be a different standard than reasonableness for purposes of financial liability of the officer."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2189.777,2190.894,"--Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.431,2228.485,That's perfectly true so far as the Bill of Rights is concerned.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2241.543,2250.148,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe, though, that when you look at the Fourth Amendment, that you should resolve it in favor of the right, that that has been traditionally what--"
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.148,2258.754,"No matter what the arguments on each side are, you resolve it in favor of the claim of right?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2258.754,2262.64,"--Well, I would have to be presented with a particular argument."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.023,2288.973,You mean the probable cause standard?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2288.973,2289.809,Yes.
1986.85-1520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.71,2325.031,"Well, we've still been deciding the standard primarily, and I'm sure we'll continue to be deciding it, primarily in cases that involve the exclusionary rule."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2356.835,2361.239,"--Justice Scalia, I think that is a valid concern."
1986.85-1520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.575,2477.145,"xxx of conducting it, if the information that you get from it is excludable?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2480.014,2482.466,"That's a good question, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1520,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2548.625,2558.716,"Mr. Sheehy, before you do, I'm just curious... it's of no consequence... the robbery at the savings and loan was out on Grand Avenue, St. Paul, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2558.716,2560.299,"--Yes, it was."
1986.85-1520,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2560.299,2565.12,Where are these homes located that are pertinent in the case?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2565.12,2571.607,"Well, there's a map attached to Russell Anderson's affidavit in the Appendix, Your Honor."
1986.85-1520,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2572.341,2574.126,"Well, just generally, what part of town?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2574.126,2580.297,--They were in the Selby Dale area and North of 94 there in St. Paul.
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.899,2693.684,You say that Pierson v. Ray didn't actually say the officer would have immunity.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2693.684,2694.036,--Right.
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2694.036,2698.438,"But it certainly said that he would not have to pay damages, didn't it?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2698.438,2700.457,"Right, but on a defense on the merits."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2709.813,2719.768,"But are you suggesting that Pierson v. Ray held only that if there was no constitutional violation, the officer would not have to pay damages?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2719.768,2720.37,That's right.
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.77,2723.988,That certainly is not the way I have read it.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2736.963,2741.634,"Well, that... Your Honor, maybe I should be a bit more specific in response to your question."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2773.069,2778.557,"And it's false... in a false arrest case, you'd take the same position?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2778.557,2785.913,"In a false arrest case, yes, that they would need probable cause for a defense."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.646,2790.681,And under... is that the state law?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2790.681,2791.466,--Is that the state law?
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.466,2798.47,"Yes, in the states, when somebody sues for false arrest, is that the normal rule of the states?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2798.47,2802.322,"The common law, Your Honor, I believe, is that you had to prove your legal privilege."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.94,2805.54,Now what does that mean?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2807.726,2815.748,"--Well, if you had a privilege to arrest somebody, meaning that if you met the legal standard, then the arrest--"
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.748,2824.854,"Well, do you think the officer was always liable at common law for false arrest and for damages if he didn't have probable cause?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2824.854,2831.592,"--Yes, I do, if probable cause was the standard being applied at the time."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.592,2833.126,"Well, that's part of my question."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2833.126,2833.709,Okay.
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2927.521,2940.245,"But we've never addressed the question of whether, in the probable cause nonwarrant context, the Leon principle would extend to not requiring a suppression there."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2940.245,2942.614,"No, the Court has not."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.575,2980.37,"Well, is it your understanding of Leon that if we were to apply Leon to a situation like this, then is the answer here that there would be no constitutional violation, or that there's immunity, or that there's not immunity?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2980.37,2986.726,"Well, if they followed... if the Court were to follow what was said in Malley, that would be my conclusion."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2988.643,2990.012,I gave you three choices.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2992.195,2994.48,"--Well, I don't think it's a necessary conclusion."
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2995.832,2999.633,That what is a necessary conclusion?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,2999.633,3014.21,"--That if the Court were to apply the good faith exception in a warrantless context, it isn't a necessary conclusion that the officer would have to have qualified immunity."
1986.85-1520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.464,3047.598,"Mr. Sheehy, you... it is the consequence of what you're proposing, however, that whenever we have before us a probable cause determination, even in an exclusionary context, the question we ought to ask ourselves is, was this action so far beyond what it was reasonable for the police officer to do that we'd be willing to hold the police officer personally liable in damages?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3047.598,3055.454,"Yes, I believe that's incorporated right into the probable cause standard itself."
1986.85-1520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.372,3137.108,That raises an interesting question here.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3204.8,3210.335,"--Well, Your Honor, I call to mind your opinion in Halperin v. Kissinger."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.954,3299.143,"xxx if he had gotten a warrant, your basic argument would be different about clearly applied law?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3301.512,3306.416,"If he had gotten a warrant, then we'd be in the Malley v. Briggs situation where--"
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.416,3320.842,"I know, but your argument... your argument certainly reaches warranted situations; that you determine immunity only based on whether the law is clearly established."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3320.842,3327.245,"--No, I believe that our argument is consistent with Fourth Amendment principles, which Malley is too."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.464,3334.249,As long as the officer gets a warrant.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3334.249,3335.518,Yes.
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.755,3348.409,Even though the warrant is held invalid because of lack of probable cause?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3348.409,3353.479,--If it was a reasonable--
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.479,3356.765,How do you now... if it was a reasonable what?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3356.765,3359.05,"--If it was a reasonable error, if--"
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.05,3360.867,Reasonable error by the officer?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3363.718,3373.574,"--Well, right under the standard in Malley v. Briggs is what I would apply, is, is that if no reasonable officer would have thought the warrant should issue, then I would say liability--"
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.574,3380.244,"Well, that's the argument on the other side with respect to situations where there's no warrant."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3380.244,3389.183,"--But it's a fundamentally different situation, Your Honor, because there you've interposed the neutral, detached magistrate which is generally--"
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.183,3389.916,Whose made an error.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3389.916,3391.733,--required by the Constitution.
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3391.733,3392.318,Whose made an error.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3399.122,3402.991,"Well, because he has taken advantage of that warrant requirement."
1986.85-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.227,3412.715,But he made a mistake on probable cause by even asking the magistrate to get the warrant.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3412.715,3414.131,But it's a unique situation.
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.427,3449.471,"But we said in Malley v. Briggs that the magistrate's determination... some other people said, I should say... doesn't conclude the issue, that if it was unreasonable to present the affidavit, then it's no good."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3449.471,3451.356,Yes.
1986.85-1520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.946,3462.746,You don't think that Malley that involved an application of the law?
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3475.206,3475.822,No--
1986.85-1520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3475.822,3482.876,"My next question is, if Malley was an application case, what isn't an application case?"
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3482.876,3485.478,"--No, Malley is an application case, undoubtedly."
1986.85-1520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3518.283,3525.103,"It may be, but it's not consistent with the theory that you only apply Harlow at the theoretical stage and not at the application stage."
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3525.103,3525.487,--That's true.
1986.85-1520,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3525.487,3525.987,That's may only point.
1986.85-1520,1,33121,john_patrick_sheehy,,3525.987,3527.037,That is true.
1986.85-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3607.923,3609.44,"Thank you, Mr. Sheehy."
1986.85-1520,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3616.779,3623.033,"Well, Your Honor, unless the sneaker needs any further polish, I'll rest on our submission."
1986.85-1520,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3623.033,3624.255,The case is submitted.
