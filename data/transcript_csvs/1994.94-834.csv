1994.94-834,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.657,We'll hear argument next... spectators are admonished to remain silent until you leave the courtroom.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,61.132,63.783,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-834,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.836,221.531,"We really haven't borrowed very often from the National Labor Relations Act, have we?"
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,221.531,222.232,No.
1994.94-834,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.553,227.104,Yes.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,227.104,236.801,"But it has... this Court, until fairly recently, simply didn't borrow very often from any Federal statute until the last 10 or 12 years."
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,236.801,252.97,"I suppose you're going to get to this at some point, but will you comment specifically on why the NLRA is a better source, is subject to a better analogy than the Pennsylvania statute for payment of back wages due?"
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,252.97,253.581,Yes.
1994.94-834,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,291.605,304.134,But the notice to the National Labor Relations Board is to invoke the board's procedure so that it can preserve the bargaining context over the short period of time when collective bargaining agreements often exist.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,327.549,339.818,"Both under the National Labor Relations Act and under the WARN act it seems to me that the same goal is being pursued, which is not simply a collective bargaining goal under the National Labor Relations Act."
1994.94-834,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,379.294,380.554,I may have jumped ahead.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,413.786,416.749,"Well, I believe the Court ought to look at all those acts."
1994.94-834,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.172,442.263,That's pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement under the NLRA?
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,442.263,442.604,No.
1994.94-834,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.58,453.481,"When you say the act, you mean the NLRA."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,453.481,457.334,"Excuse me, the NLRA requires effects bargaining."
1994.94-834,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.533,490.806,But that's to facilitate collective bargaining.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,490.806,493.949,But to facilitate collective bargaining to what end.
1994.94-834,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.837,510.579,"Well, it depends, too, on what level of generality you're talking about."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,518.234,537.918,"No, but in an effects bargaining situation, what's crystal clear is that when the union sits down with the management, what the union is seeking is some type of aid for the employees that are going to lose their jobs: severance pay, retraining, perhaps some type of concession to keep the plant open... I mean, it's a very focused inquiry."
1994.94-834,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.918,543.31,"Yes, but what they're going to get is basically consensual, whereas here what you get is by statute."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,543.31,543.611,No.
1994.94-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.036,594.913,"If we focus on those employees, the ones who aren't organized, there's a concern that might not be present if we were thinking of the union, so lay DelCostello to one side."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,625.123,627.494,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe so."
1994.94-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,669.212,672.665,"That was all tied into, it's in the midst of bargaining."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,672.665,673.736,--Well--
1994.94-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,673.736,677.038,Here you can't make that claim to the same extent.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,680.63,696.02,"--Well, the filing of a 301 action in court, while it clearly has an impact later on the collective bargaining relationship because collective bargaining agreements are interpreted through a 301 action, it doesn't have a direct impact on the ongoing collective bargaining process."
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,712.93,715.303,"Well, and some cases are easy and some are not."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,723.408,723.949,--I--
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.949,731.372,And so the ease in some cases it doesn't seem to me is a good reason to assume ease in all.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,776.973,785.539,"--Well, first of all, Justice Souter, you are entitled, an employee would be entitled under the National Labor Relations Act to back pay in that situation, so in other words, if you have two identical--"
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,785.539,794.345,"Yes, but he's... the NLRA doesn't have any formula to the effect that if you fail, it's equal... the failure is equal to 60 days' wages."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,794.345,794.725,--It is--
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,794.725,795.186,Does it?
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,795.186,797.266,"--No, but it can be greater."
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,800.339,801.388,Depending on the agreement.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,801.388,805.732,"--Well, no, depending on how many days' wages were actually lost."
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,805.732,806.052,Yes.
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,806.052,815.899,"But the concept is that in both the NLRA situation and in the WARN act situation, back pay for a failure to give notice is a remedy."
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,839.843,841.045,"Well, maybe the thought is cruder than that."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,856.075,859.767,"But we have to define what we mean by analogy, and--"
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.767,864.61,"Yes, and a moment ago you were avoiding the analogy by referring to it as back pay."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,902.665,905.056,"--In the Pennsylvania Wage Collection Act, those wages are earned."
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,908.638,926.34,"If they're not earned in this case, it's because the employer does not give the notice, so that if in fact the employer says, well, this case does not cry out for the same treatment, it is only because the employer has violated the statute, and that's why it doesn't cry out for the same treatment."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,930.435,935.185,"--It's not... with all due respect, it's not necessarily linked to whether folks work or don't work."
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,971.44,986.511,"But those 60 days of wages are 60 days that... that penalty is in lieu of wages which the employer could have paid in response for labor, if the employer had given notice at the time the statute says he's supposed to."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,986.511,987.81,--It is not--
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,987.81,989.152,Isn't that correct?
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,989.152,989.452,--No.
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,989.452,990.501,Am I factually wrong on that?
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,991.022,993.794,"No... well, I think... I don't know if it's factually wrong."
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.467,1011.414,Let me... may I ask it this way?
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1025.586,1026.186,That's correct.
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1026.186,1066.335,"If the employer doesn't give the notice until 30 days before the closing, the act says to the employer, you have got to behave by paying wages just as if you had given notice at the proper time, which means you've got to pay another 60 days of wages, i.e., 30 of those for wages actually earned, and 30 for not earned, but it's... isn't it therefore... if that's the way the statute functions, isn't it fair to say that this statute creates a wage claim in order to enforce the notice requirement?"
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1066.335,1069.026,This may just be dancing on the head of a semantical--
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1069.026,1069.905,"Well, it's characterization."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1069.905,1070.395,--And that's--
1994.94-834,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1070.395,1071.848,Isn't that a fair characterization?
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1071.848,1087.339,"--No, and my answer to that would be no, because as soon as you say it's in lieu of wages, which is what you just said, as soon as you conceptualize that 30 days' damages is in lieu of wages, that means it's not earned."
1994.94-834,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.129,1108.753,"I was pretty sleepy, though."
1994.94-834,0,41323,steven_b_feirson,,1108.753,1111.185,--Thank you very much.
1994.94-834,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1697.619,1704.855,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-834,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1792.671,1797.076,"Why does the union have standing to challenge it, Mr. Gold?"
1994.94-834,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1797.076,1818.597,"The statute is quite clear in giving the union standing, associational standing to seek such liability, and that is the basis."
1994.94-834,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2070.513,2090.844,"Mr. Gold suppose that the Pennsylvania, or a State statute in a case involving WARN is really, we think, on all fours with, say, the Fair Labor Standards Act statute, the statutes serve precisely the same function, have almost the same types of provisions."
1994.94-834,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2099.311,2100.853,Your Honor--
1994.94-834,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2100.853,2102.534,Under our existing jurisprudence.
1994.94-834,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2102.534,2102.784,--Yes.
1994.94-834,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2166.835,2178.823,"The fact that there is a Federal statute that parallels, say, most of the State statutes from which we would borrow would not be, say, special exception for escaping from our presumption?"
1994.94-834,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2178.823,2200.488,"If that could be done, I am not here to argue for the overall virtue of State borrowing."
1994.94-834,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2330.913,2340.678,"Could we say, what's essential to your position in this case is that we reject the 6-month NLRA period."
1994.94-834,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2340.678,2340.938,Right.
1994.94-834,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2340.938,2349.376,"For the rest, it's in one sense academic, because you'd meet any other conceivable limitation period, whether Federal or State."
1994.94-834,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2349.376,2382.776,"Right, and I do think that when we have the discussion of the kind we do here about forum shopping and complexities, lawyers and clients should read the law books and do know the basic statute of limitations, and it is the rare case, one hopes, that these nice questions of perfect characterization come up."
1994.94-834,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.573,2670.195,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1994.94-834,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2672.956,2684.253,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-834,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2937.952,2938.982,"Thank you, Mr.--"
1994.94-834,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2966.139,2975.436,"Well, I... with respect, I don't think it would... that the proper disposition for this Court would be to send it back to the court of appeals and ask them to pick a statute."
1994.94-834,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3005.335,3006.535,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
1994.94-834,3,41323,steven_b_feirson,,3009.998,3020.106,"Quickly, I think it's important first to note that when we talk about a 6-month statute with respect to the WARN act, frequently it's going to be a lot more than 6 months."
1994.94-834,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3054.257,3060.791,"You've had your administrative toils, and you've had at least some guidance about what to do."
1994.94-834,3,41323,steven_b_feirson,,3064.992,3067.916,--Sometimes you are out there alone if it's the Equal Employment Opportunity--
1994.94-834,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3067.916,3070.488,To do that you have to go first to the EEOC.
1994.94-834,3,41323,steven_b_feirson,,3083.025,3099.647,"--But if... in both situations, whether you go to the administrative agency or you go to a lawyer to file suit, the critical... it seems to me the critical issue in a statute of limitations context is when is it that you know you have the right, and in both situations you have to know you have the right within 6 months."
1994.94-834,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.077,3100.667,"Thank you, Mr. Feirson."
