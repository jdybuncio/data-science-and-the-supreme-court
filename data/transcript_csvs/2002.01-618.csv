2002.01-618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.517,"We'll hear argument now in Number 01-618, Eric Eldred v. John D. Ashcroft."
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,9.562,12.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2002.01-618,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,74.167,92.62,"Mr. Lessig, I'll tell you what bothers me about your position, and that is that Congress has extended the term so often through the years, and if you are right, don't we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions of time?"
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,100.334,106.572,"Justice, we do not believe that the very first act extended terms at all."
2002.01-618,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.901,134.941,But there have been a number of extensions since.
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,134.941,135.335,--That's right.
2002.01-618,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,135.335,137.319,Even if you can get over the first hurdle.
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,137.319,137.956,That's right.
2002.01-618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.534,162.092,"Well, doesn't that itself mean something, Mr. Lessig?"
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,168.756,184.27,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's absolutely true that this case is here because of a fundamentally important changed circumstance that makes the Framers' limitations on the Copyright Clause much more significant."
2002.01-618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,231.025,235.55,"Well, I'm talking about court challenges, not academic challenges."
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,235.55,237.841,"--That's right, there is no court challenge."
2002.01-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,237.841,289.089,"Mr. Lessig, your theory, as I understand it, regardless of changed circumstances or not, your basic theory, which on your argument would have been appropriate at any time historically, is that there has at least got to be the possibility of a kind of a causal connection between the extension and the promotion or inducement for the creation of some subsequent work, but why is that any more plausible a reading of the Promotion Clause than simply a reading that says the Promotion Clause requires that there be a general scheme in place, which overall tends to promote or induce, and part of one aspect of that scheme can be that the... that at the discretion of Congress the period of protection is extended from time to time?"
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,300.053,309.569,"Justice Souter, the reason is exactly related to the point I began with, that this is a case about limits and not about discretion."
2002.01-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,312.165,315.516,"No, but that's... I mean, that's the issue in the alternative reading."
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,315.516,316.54,--That's right.
2002.01-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,316.54,323.592,"And why is it a limit case, rather than a discretion within a general scheme kind--"
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,323.592,324.261,That's right.
2002.01-618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,324.261,324.543,--of clause?
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,324.543,336.007,"Because if this Court does not adopt a reading of the form we've offered, then there is no limit to the ability of Congress to extend subsisting terms."
2002.01-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.007,338.077,Do you say the same thing for scope?
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,344.236,344.546,Yes.
2002.01-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,344.546,353.278,"--the expanded applications of copyright, and Congress itself extends the scope from time to time."
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,353.278,353.796,That's right.
2002.01-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.796,360.45,"Would you make, as far as, say, translation rights that didn't exist before, the same argument?"
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,360.45,360.83,I--
2002.01-618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,360.83,363.341,"Why... or... and if you wouldn't, why not?"
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,363.341,370.831,"--I... no, Justice Ginsburg, we would not, and the reason is again related to the method we have adopted to interpret ""limited Times""."
2002.01-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.485,400.316,Could we then go back to Justice O'Connor's question?
2002.01-618,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,435.842,446.125,"--Justice Breyer, under our theory as we've advanced it, you're right; the 1976 act would be unconstitutional."
2002.01-618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,454.175,455.855,"Maybe we ought to find another theory, then."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1646.892,1650.076,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1749.977,1756.739,"Yes, but take one of the early extensions, just extending a... an already granted patent to an inventor for an extra 10 years."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1763.959,1764.625,"--Well, the Congress--"
2002.01-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.625,1765.581,"And that's our question, really."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1765.581,1772.671,"--Well, that... it seems to me that there may be... this is... the clause itself is a very, very broad grant."
2002.01-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.446,1777.814,"Do you view it as entirely a grant, or do you think it also contains limitations?"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1777.814,1788.388,"--Well, I think that to the extent that there may be limitations, Justice Stevens, they are... require considerable deference by this Court to the judgment of Congress--"
2002.01-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.388,1791.531,"Well, I understand that, but do you... I'd be interested in knowing, do you think it does contain limitations?"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1791.531,1798.757,"--It contains... the clause itself contains limitations, limited times, authors, exclusive rights and things of that nature."
2002.01-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.965,1826.633,"How did the example we just talked about, a patentee giving an extra 10 years on his... how does that promote the progress of science?"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1826.633,1833.762,"--Well, it may provide additional incentives for the patentee to exploit and promote and disseminate that particular work."
2002.01-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.022,1856.534,"I'm just concentrating on our patentee, and I'm wondering how that fits into the notion that there was a bargain in effect between the inventor and the Government that at a certain period of time it would become part of the public domain."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1858.525,1883.181,"--It isn't inconsistent, I submit, Justice Stevens, for the Congress to exercise its juris... its responsibility under this broad grant of power to determine that there could be many ways in which the holder of an existing right may benefit the public by continuing to have that right for an additional period of time, the same reason that Congress... same reasons that Congress had when it created the right in the first place."
2002.01-618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1884.083,1886.838,"No, the reason for the right in the first place was to encourage invention."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1886.838,1903.728,"--Well, but I... we submit that specifically with respect to the Copyright Clause, but I think it applies to the patent portion of the clause at all, it isn't just the invention, it isn't just the writing of the work... and this relates to the questions that were asked of my colleague a moment ago."
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1907.417,1908.525,Dissemination alone?
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1908.525,1910.963,--Not necessarily the dissemination alone--
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.963,1911.955,"Well, no, not... don't say not necessarily."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1918.825,1921.65,--That something is already in the public domain.
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1921.65,1921.929,That's correct.
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1931.667,1934.92,"I would not want to rule that out, Justice Breyer, for the very reason--"
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1934.92,1936.581,"Well, I want to say, do you think yes or no?"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1936.581,1951.435,"--Well, I think that it could very well be yes, for the reason that in the 1790 statute the Congress specifically was aware of... that there were State copyright laws which didn't last as long as the Federal statute."
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1959.895,1961.681,"So in your opinion, in my example, if you recall it--"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1961.681,1961.955,It's--
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1961.955,1974.411,"--your answer would be, if Congress tomorrow wants to give a copyright to a publisher solely for the purpose of reproducing and disseminating Ben Jonson, Shakespeare, it can do it?"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1974.411,1975.802,--It may--
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.802,1977.635,I hate to say may--
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1977.635,1977.834,--Well--
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.834,1979.415,--because that really... that's an important question.
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1979.415,1990.26,"--Well, because I don't think that a per... I don't think there is a per se rule that should apply here because this is a grant of Congress, to Congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial."
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1994.538,1996.252,"All right, let me explain to you why it's important to me."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2067.646,2076.438,"--Well, I also see compliance with international competitive markets and the laws that are being adopted, and the incentives--"
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.438,2076.835,Uniformity.
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2077.588,2078.78,"--Well, that's not just uniformity."
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.306,2114.575,"Why... on the last point, it's... I've counted that as zero."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2141.067,2151.821,"--Well, I think that that's a very good illustration of why the authority is granted to Congress, because if you are an 80-year-old writer, that may make a considerable difference in terms of what you decide to do."
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.821,2152.536,How could it?
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2152.536,2162.659,"It may... because you may... if you have no incentive, if you know that this is going to go into the public domain sooner rather than later, it may affect your judgment with respect to--"
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.659,2162.938,In... I--
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2162.938,2169.256,"--It might also affect whether the publisher... what the publisher pays for your prospective work, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.633,2189.177,"--So you think, say, Verdi, Othello, Verdi, Othello, 80 years old, the prospect of an extra 20 years way down the pike would have made a difference?"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2189.177,2204.366,"Well, I think again that illustrates why the authority is vested in Congress to make these judgments rather than in courts to make these judgments, because we're not talking about the effect on an individual author, or an individual creator."
2002.01-618,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2213.108,2226.179,"But it is hard to understand how, if the overall purpose of the Copyright Clause is to encourage creative work, how some retroactive extension could possibly do that."
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2243.43,2255.98,"--Well, that's a... that is a difficult question to say whether there is any limiting principle when such a broad grant of power, authority is given to Congress and has been exercised so repeatedly that--"
2002.01-618,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2255.98,2261.977,"Well, if it's a limited term, as the Constitution says, is there indeed any limit out there?"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2261.977,2280.16,"--What I submit... well, first of all, even the petitioners acknowledge that, as far as prospective limits are concerned, that isn't a judgment that this Court is being made to ask and, in fact, the petitioners acknowledge that it isn't a judgment that this Court should make, so the only point that the petitioners--"
2002.01-618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.16,2285.073,"Well, if Congress says we're going to grant this copyright indefinitely, forever--"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2285.073,2286.263,--That would seem--
2002.01-618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.263,2289.21,"--that violates the limited term, does it not?"
2002.01-618,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2289.21,2290.596,--I acknowledge that.
2002.01-618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2291.729,2296.201,In Victorian England you could buy a box seat for 900 years.
2002.01-618,2,34782,lawrence_lessig,,3354.461,3361.134,General Olson has been perfectly clear in setting out the structure of the Government's argument.
2002.01-618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3497.422,3499.616,"Thank you, Mr. Lessig."
