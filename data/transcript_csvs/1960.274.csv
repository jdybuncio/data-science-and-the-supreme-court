1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,592.51,594.612,In July 1957.
1960.274,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,594.612,596.88,1957.
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,596.88,609.478,"She, prior to that time for some years prior to that time, had employed that most of this Maine -- the homeworkers from Maine, they are now 200 members of the -- of the cooperative."
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.953,1034.844,"Motivated, you mean in this creation of this --"
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1034.844,1037.685,In -- in the organization of the cooperative.
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1223.193,1226.945,What did it -- what - what was the certificate then?
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1227.454,1234.519,The certificate of membership gave them the right to vote in the annual -- to vote for the directors in the annual membership meetings.

1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1237.718,1238.457,They didn't have any?
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1238.457,1242.16,"Did they have even a theoretical right to division of profits if any, of the business?"
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1242.16,1250.063,The bylaws provided that none -- no profits should be or no dividends should be issued on the certificates.
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.018,1288.104,"Well, that's your theory, but it was set up though as a division of profits after a certain cost had been paid."

1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1289.571,1292.589,"-- after the costs, certainly after this point and there's been --"
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1292.589,1295.217,"And the members vote for the board of the directors, didn't they?"
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1298.044,1299.239,No.
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1314.229,1318.503,They had -- you said two meetings?
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1318.503,1329.629,I think there was two -- there were two special meetings and one annual meeting and none of them was anywhere near quorum.
1960.274,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1352.414,1353.709,(Inaudible)
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1353.709,1359.443,"One meeting, there were 37 out at -- out of 195 members present."
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.99,1368.748,"At -- at one of the meetings at which quorum was not present, the --"
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1368.748,1369.24,They did.
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1369.24,1373.16,"-- they -- they amended the bylaws to provide for a lower quorum, didn't they?"
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1373.16,1374.37,They -- yes.
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1379.795,1380.749,And thereafter?
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1380.749,1390.058,"It seems to me, that too has some effect on whether or not the -- this was a bona fide number to control the cooperative."
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1399.977,1404.14,Were the members all in -- all in a close physical neighborhood or (Voice Overlap) Maine?
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1404.14,1413.436,"The original incorporators were all in and around in towns I think, within a radius certainly of 100 miles."
1960.274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1440.07,1441.396,Where were these meetings held?
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1441.396,1447.563,"The meetings were held in either Waterville or Troy, Maine."
1960.274,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1447.563,1450.232,Who would elect the directors you said in --
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1450.232,1455.934,The 26 original incorporators elected the original directors.
1960.274,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1462.391,1465.799,"Well I thought you said, some had been elected (Inaudible) by --"
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1465.799,1469.564,"Well, by the meetings without a quorum, to fill vacancies for resignations."
1960.274,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1469.564,1474.164,Meetings -- meetings with just the elected directors?
1960.274,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,1476.562,1484.246,"Well, I think it was other business, other business transacted to for example."
1960.274,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1619.6,1622.948,You may -- you may Ms. Margolin.
1960.274,1,37694,philip_s_bird,,1645.549,1653.101,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.274,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1845.44,1849.602,"What is the law were you seeking to avoid, Mr. Bird?"
1960.274,1,37694,philip_s_bird,,1849.602,1850.404,I beg your pardon?
1960.274,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1850.404,1853.127,What part of the law were you seeking to avoid?
1960.274,1,37694,philip_s_bird,,1853.127,1875.333,"The minimum -- we were seeking to comply with the law in respect that admittedly, we knew that these women and the women knew it themselves, could not pay themselves $1 an hour minimum and they could not comply with the minimum wage an hour requirements for Fair Labor Standards Act."
1960.274,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1875.333,1878.204,"So, it was a minimum wage an hour --"
1960.274,1,37694,philip_s_bird,,1878.204,1879.4,Law that admitted --
1960.274,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1879.4,1880.962,-- requirements that you were seeking to avoid?
1960.274,1,37694,philip_s_bird,,1880.962,1882.377,Right.
1960.274,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1960.745,1964.002,And who -- who were you employed by when you were doing this for some --
1960.274,1,37694,philip_s_bird,,1964.002,1965.113,I wasn't employed by the women.
1960.274,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3176.79,3182.068,Ms. Margolin.
1960.274,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3182.068,3204.419,I just have one point to add in answer to counsel's question as to how can a group employ any of themselves as a -- apparently this was the approach of the court below and I think the very fact of this case and I will answer to that.
1960.274,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3237.39,3241.421,Has an attack made on the bona fide issues of the cooperative?
1960.274,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3241.421,3241.85,Yes.
1960.274,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3268.48,3273.328,May I ask you just one more question before I am -- how do they get paid?
1960.274,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3273.328,3293.663,"They are paid at rates – there is a schedule of rates in the -- in the record at rates that are fixed by Mrs. Whitaker, who is the general manager, theoretically subject to the approval of the board of directors and they had first --"
1960.274,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3293.663,3296.023,Hourly or daily rates or what?
1960.274,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3296.023,3297.316,They're piece rates.
1960.274,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3297.346,3300.856,Piece rates – all together?
1960.274,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3300.856,3302.862,For -- up for per dozen.
1960.274,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3318.716,3322.855,"Was there any pooling of funds, (Inaudible) of funds?"
1960.274,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3322.855,3327.764,They are paid -- their paying hasn't been as regular and recently as it was.
