1985.84-6470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,80.577,"Mr. Crawford, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,80.577,84.498,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-6470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,588.777,601.131,"There you could argue that the state actor did, in a general sense, intend the taking and meet a general intent requirement."
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,601.131,613.658,"I suppose, Justice O'Connor... I can't say and I wouldn't say that the prison authorities here intended that Robert Davidson have his face chopped up with at work."
1985.84-6470,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,664.169,669.09,You too would limit recovery to the prison setting I would conclude.
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,669.09,681.068,--I limit it to the prison setting because it seems to me we can find a clear duty here that is much more easily defined than you find in the general driving on the streets.
1985.84-6470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.946,715.819,"May I ask, when you say we have a clear duty here, what is the source of that duty?"
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,719.396,722.333,"I think it is a federal law duty, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-6470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,723.769,725.144,--It is in the Due Process Clause?
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,725.144,729.735,--I think the Due Process... That is why I conclude that there is some piece of substance involved here.
1985.84-6470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,735.717,747.807,"So, I guess you would give me the same answer that was given in the previous case, that if a visitor was injured by an inmate by reason of negligent supervision by the guards, the visitor would have no cause of action."
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,751.649,761.909,--I see no reason to find a cause of action for the visitor and the case that is before the Court and the question that should be answered is the question of the inmate.
1985.84-6470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.39,779.434,Because it is his status as an inmate rather than the fact of immunity that really is the predicate for the federal claim.
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,779.434,782.636,"No, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-6470,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.042,837.004,"Immunity is crucial but it is not sufficient because... I am not sure under the New Jersey statute, but you conceivably could have an immunity statute which would bar a claim by a visitor as well as an inmate and that wouldn't be sufficient to give them a federal claim though, because you need both the--"
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,837.004,838.878,"--I think that is correct, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-6470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.878,846.407,--The basis for the claim is that the state has deprived the person of liberty.
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,846.407,849.563,The state has deprived the person of liberty--
1985.84-6470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.563,850.344,Through negligence.
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,850.344,851.405,"--Yes, through negligence."
1985.84-6470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.405,854.45,It is still hooked to a deprivation of liberty.
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,854.45,856.497,"That is correct, Justice White."
1985.84-6470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.497,857.574,And without any remedy for it.
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,857.574,858.668,And without any remedy for it.
1985.84-6470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.668,865.821,"And, would you say that if there is remedy there never was a deprivation, a constitutional deprivation?"
1985.84-6470,0,29684,james_d_crawford,,865.821,870.023,"There is a deprivation, but not a constitutional deprivation as I read the Fourteenth Amendment."
1985.84-6470,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,903.385,909.819,"General, you may proceed."
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,909.819,913.365,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-6470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.777,1063.647,"Well, Mrs. Mansier, don't you think the majority of the Court rejected that sort of definition of deprivation in the Parratt case?"
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1063.647,1074.284,"Justice Rehnquist, I do not think that the Court rejected it in the specific sense that it was a part of the holding of the case in Parratt versus Taylor."
1985.84-6470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.773,1145.178,"May I ask the same question I guess I asked earlier, but your submission is that negligence can never constitute a deprivation?"
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1145.178,1145.848,That is--
1985.84-6470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.848,1150.519,Supposing the warden negligently executed the wrong defendant and killed him by mistake.
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1152.502,1159.828,"--Justice Stevens, I do not envision any execution as a negligent act."
1985.84-6470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.42,1162.748,What is wrong with my hypothetical?
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1163.762,1172.728,"There may be a mistake as, indeed, there was a mistake in Baker versus McCollan, and there this Court found there wasn't even a right in the first instance."
1985.84-6470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.728,1178.038,"That is right, but they didn't say that... They didn't rely on the reason of negligence not constituting a deprivation."
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1178.038,1181.974,"That is correct, because they did even need to reach that point."
1985.84-6470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.41,1186.957,Take that case.
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1202.7,1210.213,"--Because here we are dealing with the Due Process Clause and the Due Process Clause has the specific language of the word ""deprive""."
1985.84-6470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.726,1218.256,"So, you are not contending that negligence can never give rise to a 1983 action."
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1220.615,1222.614,That is--
1985.84-6470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1222.614,1230.97,"Well, I suppose your answer in part to the execution question is that there was an intent to execute someone."
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1234.937,1236.875,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-6470,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.875,1238.139,"So, it can be deprivation."
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1253.117,1253.992,That is correct.
1985.84-6470,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1444.93,1445.944,"Yes, but may I ask this question?"
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1466.749,1477.809,"It is true, Justice Stevens, that the immunity that is the focal point here does deal with injuries caused by one prisoner to another prisoner."
1985.84-6470,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1518.48,1521.525,Have you answered Justice Stevens' question?
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1528.084,1540.002,We are giving the prisoner fewer rights with reference to injuries caused by other prisoners in the sense that for that plaintiff there is immunity.
1985.84-6470,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.828,1544.328,Sort of a penalogical fellow-servant doctrine.
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1546.389,1548.311,That is certainly one way of articulating it.
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.11,1664.982,"Well, what about... You say negligence never then, is that it, can form the basis?"
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1672.73,1679.304,--We are focusing here on negligence not being a deprivation within the meaning of the Due Process Clause?
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.304,1679.85,Yes.
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1679.85,1687.207,"And, we are talking about a negligent taking of life, liberty, or property."
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.207,1687.426,Right.
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1706.246,1713.963,If a prison guard acts intentionally--
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.963,1714.228,Yes.
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1714.228,1730.33,"--and as a result of that a prisoner is injured if we are sticking with the kind of case that we have here, then that is an entirely different case and we would say that an intentional act does equal a deprivation."
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.33,1730.564,All right.
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1735.78,1748.839,"Justice O'Connor, we realize that courts have historically found difficulty in dealing with exactly where the lines are between different standards of conduct."
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.931,1800.209,"So, just simple negligence, negligently failing to give medical treatment is not... doesn't give a cause of action?"
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1800.209,1801.443,"That is correct, it does not under Estelle."
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.443,1804.831,"And, we have held... Is that because the Eighth Amendment controls?"
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1804.831,1810.375,That is an Eighth Amendment case and the determination was made--
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.375,1815.858,"Well, would you think that it could be any other kind of a case?"
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1825.463,1830.727,"--Justice White, that is, indeed, what I would have called here the third argument."
1985.84-6470,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.727,1830.93,All right.
1985.84-6470,1,36315,madeleine_w_mansier,,1830.93,1842.706,"That is... But, I am perfectly willing to reach it now and to skip over for the moment again the argument of whether immunity can... automatically means that there is no due process."
1985.84-6470,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2040.471,2053.951,Mr. Solicitor General?
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2053.951,2057.572,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-6470,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2251.104,2261.459,"Mr. Fried, I suppose the Petitioners in these two cases would say to you, well, we are only concerned about the situation in a prison setting."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2261.459,2274.142,"That point was emphasized, particularly in argument, although I must say the Eighth Amendment aspect was not emphasized as the case was litigated so far."
1985.84-6470,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2310.564,2312.08,What did the prisoner do that was voluntary?
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2315.671,2317.031,"--No, he did not."
1985.84-6470,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2317.031,2318.264,Did he stay there voluntarily?
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2318.264,2319.233,"No, he did not."
1985.84-6470,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2319.233,2321.029,"Well, how do you get involuntarily?"
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2321.029,2323.466,He is not there--
1985.84-6470,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2323.466,2326.059,You compare him with the man in the street struck by an automobile.
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2328.386,2334.508,--The man in the street struck by the automobile also does not voluntarily choose to be in the path of a--
1985.84-6470,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.508,2336.632,"But, he stood in the street."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2336.632,2338.162,"--Yes, he did."
1985.84-6470,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.162,2340.068,"And, he didn't have to stand there."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2340.068,2343.316,He made no choice.
1985.84-6470,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.316,2346.706,He didn't have to stand in that street.
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2346.706,2346.877,"No, he did not."
1985.84-6470,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2346.877,2349.455,"So, isn't that the difference?"
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2366.307,2377.491,"With respect, Justice Marshall, that difference is important insofar as it creates a duty of care and the duty of care then is the predicate for the negligence action."
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.423,2433.123,"Well, it took some rather recent cases to make all that so awfully clear."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2433.123,2438.919,"--But, we hope that it is clear now and that--"
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.919,2443.464,"Well, it may not have been all that clear for a long, long time."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2443.464,2460.504,--Yet as clear as it is now it is clear because oppression comes when there is some deliberate... some systematic invasion of right which is what we say is missing here.
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.641,2476.715,"Nevertheless, if it had been all that clear about the Due Process Clause, that language wouldn't have appeared in Parratt."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2476.715,2488.071,--In Parratt what this Court did was establish those conditions which are sufficient to deprive a person of a due process claim.
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.118,2529.008,"Not if the states have provided remedies, I suppose."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2529.008,2535.678,"Well, I say of residual tort liability to the extent that the state does not provide a remedy."
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.301,2538.55,"Yes, they may."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2538.55,2549.186,--under circumstances very similar to those in which this Court has said it is appropriate for the federal government to fail to provide a remedy.
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.902,2602.274,What happens to the state's freedom when the tort is intentional?
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2602.274,2620.893,"If the tort is intentional, Your Honor, and I think that is an important point for us to seek to clear up, if the tort is intentional, you are very likely to have an Eighth Amendment or the shocks-the-conscience kind of substantive deprivation."
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.154,2633.605,Which would deprive the state of its immunity.
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2633.605,2634.542,"It would, indeed."
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.338,2637.432,Despite the legislature's judgment.
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2637.432,2644.086,"--Oh, I... The legislature cannot deprive a citizen of his rights."
1985.84-6470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.13,2653.847,"So, your argument really hinges on the construction of the word ""deprive""."
1985.84-6470,2,18942,charles_fried,,2653.847,2657.236,"I think that is a very important part of it, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6470,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2659.064,2661.126,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Crawford?"
1985.84-6470,3,29684,james_d_crawford,,2661.126,2664.983,Four very brief points which I would like to make.
1985.84-6470,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.17,2708.574,Are you making that a distinction between the intentional and the negligent act?
1985.84-6470,3,29684,james_d_crawford,,2708.574,2708.996,No.
1985.84-6470,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2772.049,2774.221,"Thank you, counsel."
