1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.831,"Mr. Gillespie, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,28.831,33.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,132.531,149.335,"What would you think of the hypothetical situation that one of the members of the class wrote in to the Court and said, I think the court has been wrong in the decision, I don't think there is any money due me from Boeing Company, and therefore I refuse to accept it?"
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,149.335,153.881,"Well, Your Honor, I think you have almost that situation right here."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,179.679,183.064,"They haven't affirmatively renounced, however, have they?"
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,183.064,184.289,"No, they have not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,189.103,195.072,My hypothetical is a person who affirmatively renounces on the grounds that he thinks --
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,195.072,211.749,"I think that is an an a fortiori case under those circumstances, if he renounces there is no reason why his share of that recovery should be utilized to pay the attorneys for the class members who have claims, under this Court's decision."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.749,219.016,"You think there is no difference then between an affirmative renunciation and a passive, neglectful --"
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,219.016,222.227,"Quite right, Mr. Chief Justice; quite right."
1979.78-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.382,488.258,What was the basis of jurisdiction in the Southern District of New York?
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,488.258,498.749,"Well, the basis of jurisdiction, there were claims made under the Trust Indenture Act and under the Securities Act of 1934."
1979.78-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.749,509.733,But did -- were those the actual bases of decision in either the District Court of the Second Circuit or was it a principle of New York law?
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,509.733,529.106,"Well, are you referring to the compensation decision or the original decision under which the District Court dismissed this action on the ground that the indenture had been fully complied with; are you referring to that decision, Your Honor, or are you referring to the compensation decision which is here before the Court?"
1979.78-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.106,529.784,Both.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,529.784,539.639,"Well, I think on the first decision, on the merits it is very clear that they went on the Trust Indenture Act and the Federal Securities Act."
1979.78-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.133,563.353,This was not in any sense then at any stage of the proceedings a case of pendent jurisdiction.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,563.353,565.324,"It was not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.244,718.944,"Am I right in thinking this is not -- was not an opt in, opt out type of class action?"
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,718.944,721.17,"You are quite right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.62,801.076,"Mr. Gillespie, at that point, you just said money that might go back to Boeing."
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,801.076,801.959,Yes.
1979.78-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.959,806.253,Is it your position that any unclaimed portion does in fact go back to Boeing?
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,806.253,809.668,"It certainly is, Your Honor, but that has not been decided as yet."
1979.78-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.668,813.001,So that you would oppose any theory of escheat.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,813.001,814.387,"We certainly would, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,814.387,817.486,Let alone as to which State it would escheat.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,817.486,821.408,"That would certainly be a tremendous problem, but we would oppose that vigorously, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.528,1032.886,"Now, let me get that clear."
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1036.817,1037.624,"By amount, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1048.048,1052.656,What were the terms of the escrow account?
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1052.656,1058.248,"It is just -- well, I will --"
1979.78-1327,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1058.248,1061.094,That question is suggested by my Brother Blackmun's earlier question as to --
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1061.094,1062.843,Right.
1979.78-1327,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.843,1065.413,-- there would be ultimate escheat.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1065.413,1098.392,"Well, -- just one moment -- the paragraph, Mr. Justice Stewart, of the judgment reads, Ordered that within 15 days after the entry of this judgment the defendant shall deposit the amount of this judgment, plus interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum to the date of such deposit in a commercial bank, and so forth, upon which interest shall accumulate until disbursed."
1979.78-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.458,1125.771,"Of course it does speak of a judgment, doesn't it."
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1125.771,1128.283,"It does, Your Honor; it does speak of a judgment."
1979.78-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.043,1230.201,But that wasn't the main question in Alyeska.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1230.201,1230.605,"No, no."
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.181,1348.109,"Mr. Gillespie, before you go on, and perhaps this has already been asked, but in your view of the case will all the fund be distributed at the same time or will the 46 percent get their share before other people make claims?"
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1348.109,1361.543,"Well, Your Honor, I think that in the first place we have had two years when the effort to locate these potential claimants has gone forward, claims have been filed, they have been reviewed."
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.529,1395.051,"Well, in other words the 46 percent would be paid before you know for sure how many of the 54 percent would come in."
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1395.051,1396.232,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.232,1397.809,"Now, what will they be paid?"
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1403.273,1413.897,"Well, no, I think what would be done is that the Court would determine what was a fair attorneys' fees in this situation."
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.61,1424.879,Right.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1424.879,1427.053,-- and assess that against them.
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.053,1427.299,All right.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1427.66,1439.556,"If thereafter someone else comes in and makes a claim, the same percentage as applied to each of the claiming ones previously would apply to the new claimant."
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.662,1453.435,So that your concept of the fee is not a dollar figure but a percentage figure that would be based on what is now available plus a guess as to how much more may become of it.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1453.435,1456.965,"Well, I don't think that is quite right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.302,1474.77,Say they come up with a figure of a million dollars.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1474.77,1475.815,Then that is applied --
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1475.815,1481.207,And then you apply that across the board of the 46 percent and say that amounts to 25 percent of each person's --
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1481.207,1482.042,Correct.
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.042,1485.327,"But then if more people come in, they would get more than a million dollars in fees."
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1485.327,1486.322,"Yes, they would, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.322,1490.481,So that the determination of a reasonable fee would really be less than the amount they would actually receive.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1490.481,1494.187,"Well, I don't know whether the Court would take that into consideration or not."
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.721,1528.527,But in essence the fee would really be fixed as a percentage of the --
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1528.527,1534.21,I think as in all of this kind of case that the percentage would certainly be a very important --
1979.78-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.21,1537.353,"Well, it is the sole criterion after the order is entered, isn't it?"
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1537.353,1548.377,"Well, unless as Your Honor suggested, I think -- it is hard to say how the District Court will actually do this determination."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1565.3,1574.563,"With respect to this $128,000 you more or less have seemingly at least waived their claims."
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1582.299,1588.872,"Well, Your Honor, I -- there is nothing in the record with regard to this, I would say first."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1610.221,1613.412,"Well, I would infer from that then that they were fairly modest amounts."
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1613.412,1615.974,"I would think they were fairly modest amounts, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1630.617,1634.776,That five minutes is the five minutes that you perhaps wanted to reserve for rebuttal.
1979.78-1327,0,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,1634.776,1639.591,"I would like to reserve two minutes, so I will get this off my chest in three minutes if I may, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1743.515,1744.935,Mr. Winer.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1744.935,1748.757,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.296,1803.18,"Mr. Winer, let me ask you the same question -- or at least I think it is the same question Mr. Justice Blackmun asked your opponent, and that is, What is your position as to the disposition of the unclaimed funds?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1803.18,1810.645,"Your Honor, my position must be in accordance with the decisions of the courts up to now."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.325,1828.96,Then what happens?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1828.96,1831.432,What happens must be escheat.
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1840.516,1842.899,What I am asking is what your position as a lawyer is.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1842.899,1849.909,"My belief is, sir, is that they would escheat, the funds would escheat."
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1849.909,1861.077,Would it be your view the recipient of the escheats have been benefited by the services rendered.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1861.077,1862.044,"Right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1870.931,1875.452,Would not the same result take place if it went back to Boeing?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1875.452,1877.299,I think perhaps it should.
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1912.597,1916.789,If you take a position as to which State it would escheat to --
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1916.789,1917.908,"No, sir, that --"
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.908,1920.356,-- the State of Washington would be in here in a hurry.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1920.356,1920.824,That is right.
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1934.575,1936.475,But the issue isn't before us just now.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1936.475,1937.018,Sir?
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1937.018,1937.975,The issue is not before us.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1937.975,1944.571,"No, sir; no, sir, and that is why I feel -- I don't know the answer."
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1948.401,1952.938,"You can afford to be indifferent because the lien follows, I suppose."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1952.938,1957.394,"Right, I feel that is so, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.394,1976.461,Yet to a certain extent one can't decide the basis on which attorneys' fees are to be recovered in a case like this without having some feel for the disposition of the unclaimed funds.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,1990.198,1998.341,"Sir, we do not think that the plaintiffs are entitled to any part of the unclaimed funds."
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1998.341,2002.329,"In that case, they hardly have standing to be here, do they?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2002.329,2002.835,I don't know --
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.835,2003.76,Aren't you their lawyer?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2003.76,2012.646,"I don't know whether they have standing to be here, sir, but I think that Boeing has no standing here, in my opinion."
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2012.646,2025.718,Insofar as Part II of your brief that point depends entirely upon the fact that Boeing has no further interest in these funds.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2025.718,2026.44,"That is correct, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2026.44,2029.035,That they will escheat or something else will happen to them --
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2029.035,2029.848,Absolutely.
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2029.848,2031.096,-- they will never come back to Boeing.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2031.096,2032.017,Absolutely.
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2033.382,2039.634,"So whether or not they will escheat is a factor in this case, isn't it?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2039.634,2041.19,That could be a factor.
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2041.19,2045.007,"Because your whole Part II depends upon that, I think, doesn't it?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2045.007,2046.264,"No, sir, I think not."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.304,2104.977,But there is a certain element of windfall.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2110.845,2122.598,"It may -- if it should ever be determined on some basis which has not been vouchsafed that the money goes back to Boeing, then it would surely be a windfall for Boeing."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2145.162,2148.443,Could you help me with the same question I asked your opponent.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2150.66,2151.32,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.32,2157.894,"Is it not correct that we will reach a point in time when your fees will be determined, they have not yet been determined."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2157.894,2158.69,"That is correct, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2158.69,2163.081,"Now, if the judge should determine whatever a fair fee is, then how would he pay it to you?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2168.941,2181.677,According to a decision of the Court of Appeals on that point it stated specifically that it would be taken off the top as in Trustees v. Greenough.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.033,2198.648,"In other words, you claim that the amount of your fee should be entirely unaffected by the estimate of how much money will actually be paid to former debenture holders."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2198.648,2199.693,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.681,2212.78,But I don't understand how anybody would pay two fees.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2212.78,2222.174,"Under the American rule, sir, the victim of a breach of contract must be a loser."
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2262.327,2264.099,The fee is fixed.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2268.129,2270.456,May I answer that.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.272,2303.154,"Mr. Winer, let me pursue my line with you so you answer it."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2303.154,2303.915,Right.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.915,2310.58,"Supposing, based on your theory of the case, the district judge now should conclude that a million dollars is a fair fee."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2314.998,2315.139,Right.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.139,2316.504,-- and you would go home.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2320.27,2321.024,That is correct.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.024,2327.447,"All right, having taken it out, would there then be distribution to the people who have already filed their claims?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2327.447,2329.887,Immediately.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.887,2332.469,And they would bear the full --
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2332.469,2339.49,"Well, according to my feeling they would bear one-half the amount and the other half would be taken out of the funds which are not claimed."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.49,2345.006,"So that everybody's share would be reduced by some percentage, roughly a sixth of the fund."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2345.006,2348.414,Absolutely -- everybody -- plaintiffs would pay their fees and --
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.414,2350.824,And you would have all that you would ever get.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2350.824,2351.558,That is all we would ever get.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.558,2361.565,"Now, under his view of the case, if he made the assumption you are entitled to a million dollars, as I understand him you get a million now out of the right percentage; and then you continue to get more as more people came in."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2366.813,2370.541,"Well, sir, it is possible."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.697,2389.042,"Well, let me tell you very candidly, I am lost because I am not sure you have a final appealable judgment on the issue you seek to argue."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2389.042,2402.507,"Well, I understand that point and I must say that whether I didn't go into the appealability of it but I certainly argued that it was premature and I certainly do think it is premature."
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2406.267,2408.693,It wasn't even in the Court of Appeals.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2408.693,2409.8,Sir?
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2409.8,2412.109,It is not here because it wasn't even in the Court of Appeals.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2412.109,2412.335,Right.
1979.78-1327,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2412.335,2417.854,It wasn't final.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2417.854,2423.327,I argued there that it was premature but I did not succeed.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.917,2453.955,But it is possible that you could get a higher fee if he wins than if you do?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2453.955,2457.346,"Yes, sir, it is possible."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.346,2467.494,What we are fighting about is that one of the factors that the judge will take into account when he ultimately reviews the 12 different factors you have described and finally fix a dollar amount.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2469.396,2474.453,"Well, I haven't thought of it that way but I do not dispute that."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.453,2480.498,"One thing you say, you are here to represent the plaintiffs, are you not?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2489.783,2490.502,That is correct.
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.566,2523.274,"Is that the kind of argument one would normally expect from a plaintiffs' attorney who was doing the very best he could to assure the success of his clients, so to speak, even though the Court might reject the argument, for the plaintiffs' attorney to simply say, ""Well, certainly the plaintiff isn't entitled to this."""
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2527.739,2533.304,"I am afraid, Your Honor, I do not understand the question."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2537.886,2555.934,"No, I am talking about the claiming plaintiffs, whether it is conceivable they might have any entitlement to more than their prorated share after a certain point in time when there is a large part of the funds still unclaimed."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2555.934,2576.269,"Well, sir, the case was decided in Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin that there should be no fluid recovery, under no circumstances could a plaintiff get more than his personal damages; and so I have taken that to be law."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2830.809,2838.674,"In Alyeska the Court dealt both with the common fund and the common benefit theory, did it not?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2838.674,2840.535,"It distinguished the two, right."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2840.535,2849.036,"But it had made the same statement as to both of them, that they were the English rule and not the rule in this country."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2849.036,2866.92,"No, sir, I believe that the Court was very careful and that the statements in the footnotes where these statements occur, where the only place common fund and common benefit are put in the same sentence, is very careful to distinguish the two."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2961.538,2968.314,Wouldn't you say that you would be better off without the footnote which you referred to in Alyeska?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2968.314,2970.532,"No, sir; no, sir, I should not."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.234,2981.787,"On common funds, right."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2981.787,2986.223,"On common funds, right."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2990.699,2995.926,This case doesn't involve a shifting to another party.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,2995.926,2996.871,Not at all.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.384,3022.19,Where was the counsel fee going to come from in the Hall case and in the Mills case?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3022.19,3030.474,The counsel fee in Hall v. Cole came out of the union treasury.
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.474,3032.847,And in the Mills case it a came from the corporation.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3032.847,3033.735,From the corporation.
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.735,3038.428,"So it was not a spreading of the less, it was an avoidance of any loss."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3038.428,3038.814,That is right.
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3117.952,3144.132,"Well, would it not be irrelevant entirely if your theory is, as I understood it to be, that your action has benefited someone and it is now merely a matter of 49 percent going to one group and perhaps 51 percent going to Boeing or New York or Washington?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3146.171,3147.241,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3147.241,3150.229,"So then would it make any difference who those $128,000 are?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3150.229,3152.644,"Not according to my theory, not at all."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3231.045,3243.659,"You are not relying here on any statutory provision for attorneys' fees in addition to the recovery of the principal, are you?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3243.659,3245.13,In addition to?
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3245.13,3250.593,"I mean you are simply saying that you are going to collect from your client, in effect."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3250.593,3252.587,"Oh, no; no, no."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.615,3287.354,And does this particular class action section that we have been discussing provide for an award of attorneys' fees in addition to the substantive recovery?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3287.354,3290.426,"No, sir; no, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.591,3312.15,So a court couldn't award an attorneys' fee over and above the actual substantive recovery.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3312.15,3315.535,"I can't believe that, I can't imagine that it could."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3327.308,3336.312,Take your typical case where it says and in addition to the recovery the plaintiff shall be entitled to attorneys' fees.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3337.919,3339.092,"No, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.695,3354.008,You are claiming that the attorneys' fees are going to come off the top of the recoveries?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3354.008,3354.71,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.71,3361.448,"And if there is escheat and the States say, well, where is the rest of my escheat, what is your answer?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3361.448,3372.743,My answer is the benefit received by the State of New York was due to the work of the attorneys and is subject to the counsel fee earned by the attorneys.
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3372.743,3374.903,Now you are talking about New York.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3374.903,3376.023,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3376.023,3377.143,Only New York?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3377.143,3378.016,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.08,3388.737,"Well, that prompts me to ask about these other cases that you say were consolidated or brought in."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3388.737,3389.046,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.046,3392.466,Were they also venued in the Southern District?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3392.466,3393.09,Originally?
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.09,3394.223,Yes.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3394.223,3397.346,I don't believe any of them was.
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.378,3409.958,"Well, they might claim escheat, too, then."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3409.958,3412.344,"You are right, they might claim escheat."
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.396,3447.381,"But if you happened to lose on your escheat point and Boeing got it back, then a lot of your argument is considerably damaged, isn't it?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3447.381,3451.026,You mean if the State is entitled to --
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.026,3454.659,If Boeing is entitled to these unclaimed monies.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3456.299,3458.25,May I answer that briefly.
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.204,3461.125,Believe not what?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3461.125,3462.26,Because --
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.26,3465.246,You believe not what?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3465.246,3473.267,I believe that the money would not -- I believe that there would be no difference whether it went to Boeing or escheat.
1979.78-1327,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3482.77,3483.37,Right.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3483.37,3496.059,"It would be receiving it back because of a lack of some -- sort of a si prius doctrine, we can't give it to whom it belongs and therefore the next best class is Boeing."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3507.128,3520.15,"Well, you wouldn't be making the same argument though would you, about the basis for reducing the amount that went back to Boeing by the amount of the attorney's fee?"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3520.15,3523.376,"I would be making my same argument, namely --"
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3523.376,3525.621,You mean Boeing is benefited.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3525.621,3527.932,"Boeing would benefit, certainly."
1979.78-1327,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3527.932,3530.957,From your services in the suing.
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3530.957,3531.637,Right.
1979.78-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.42,3538.295,"Getting money back they never would have gotten back before, although they never would have paid it out if you hadn't sued them."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3538.295,3548.033,"Well, now here we have, Your Honor, Boeing taking the side of the non-claimant."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3560.98,3566.399,"Mr. Winer, their brief refers to $2 million claim for fees."
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3572.623,3584.566,"The record has a complete listing of hours, nature of services, and all that, only up to the point of the third appeal."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3584.566,3589.114,Is it correct that the claim for the plaintiffs' fees amounts to $2 million?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3589.114,3590.018,I am sorry.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3590.018,3593.662,Is it correct that you are claiming $2 million in fees and expenses?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3593.662,3596.48,I am not claiming even $1 million.
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3596.48,3598.046,"Well, is it correct that the entire group --"
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3598.046,3606.719,"There are some lawyers in Chicago who have had virtually nothing to do with the case, and I think they are claiming a million dollars."
1979.78-1327,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3616.279,3622.541,Has there been any evidence or any hearing at all on the question of what a reasonable fee is?
1979.78-1327,1,37328,norman_winer,,3622.541,3634.181,"There have been only very lengthy affidavits, very lengthy; but no hearing."
1979.78-1327,2,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,3635.35,3640.683,"Your Honor, I just have one item that I would like to bring up."
1979.78-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3650.791,3658.406,"Well, you agree, Mr. Gillespie, that if you win you might have to pay a larger fee than if you lose?"
1979.78-1327,2,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,3659.319,3661.375,It is entirely possible if the --
1979.78-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3661.375,3663.721,"Why isn't this strictly an advisory opinion, then?"
1979.78-1327,2,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,3663.721,3664.551,"No, no."
1979.78-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3680.113,3686.755,"No, but it is entirely possible that judge may think, based on what he knows, that the plaintiffs ought to get a million dollars in fees."
1979.78-1327,2,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,3686.755,3687.701,Right.
1979.78-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3687.701,3689.275,And he could do it in one or two ways.
1979.78-1327,2,41421,s_hazard_gillespie,,3706.548,3708.898,Conceivably from each additional claimant.
1979.78-1327,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3757.333,3761.366,"Well, nonetheless the amount of the fees was not fixed."
