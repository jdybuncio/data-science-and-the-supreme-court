1976.75-1753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.14,"We’ll hear arguments next in 1753, 1660, 1782, Santa Fe Industries against Green."
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,51.196,55.763,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1753,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,302.307,306.166,Why is that -- can’t the stock traded over-the-counter?
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,306.166,309.171,"The very thin market, Mr. Justice."
1976.75-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.035,389.485,"Mr. Glendon, is that really a significant point as did in Kirby incurring indebtedness to get the money from the parent?"
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,389.485,389.976,No.
1976.75-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.976,391.733,You mean the parent -- it was just capital contribution?
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,391.733,393.753,Yes.
1976.75-1753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,545.987,589.944,I think we will resume there at 10 o’clock in the morning.
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,601.988,606.815,"I would like to reserve three minutes for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.75-1753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,606.815,610.305,Very well.
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,610.305,614.567,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,730.009,734.939,"And of course, its claim is addressed to the fact that he didn’t have any option about disclosure."
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,734.939,759.198,"Well, he does have -- he has another action, of course, of getting a fair valuation and the Delaware statute, as I pointed out Mr. Chief Justice, specifically provides in this part of his contract in the charter of the corporation that minority stockholders can be eliminated from the corporation."
1976.75-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.319,1036.358,"Mr. Glendon, what if the majority shareholders, moving under the Delaware short-form merger statute, did engage in deceptive conduct and saying discussing valuation with the minority shareholders, would the minority shareholders then have a 10b-5 action for damages?"
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,1036.358,1055.048,"If they engaged in deception and the disclosure, yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think they would and the Popkin case made clear that 10b-5 in a short-form merger is not nugatory thing because the short-form -- the splinter shareholder has an investment decision to make."
1976.75-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.919,1333.711,"Mr. Glendon, could I interrupt for just a second."
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,1351.352,1360.853,"Well, that would be in the area of disclosure and that’s what the statute is about Mr. Justice Stevens."
1976.75-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.499,1371.908,"But in the event that there is a conflict between the Delaware statute and the requirements of Rule 10b-5, Rule 10b-5 would apply, would it not?"
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,1371.908,1379.626,"But we are saying -- we are saying to you here, sir that there cannot be that conflict under this aspect of the case."
1976.75-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.215,1383.885,"Well, I understand your argument --"
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,1383.885,1395.096,It is a regulation; It is a regulation of Delaware corporations who were chartered by the State of Delaware and set up and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
1976.75-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1423.0,1428.376,But isn’t your basic proposition that there’s simply no violation of Rule 10b-5?
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,1428.376,1428.945,Yes.
1976.75-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1428.945,1434.679,"And if that’s true, then it doesn’t matter whether a violation would require a revision of the Delaware statute or not?"
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,1434.679,1473.309,"Well, what we are saying simply is that to get to the result that it got, the Court had to rewrite the statute and to do that, to take a federal statute and apply it so that you have got to rewrite a state statute in the essence of a clear intent by the Congress that they are to do that, an expressed intent that if Congress had said here, “you may regulate”, and they may pass, they may pass a federal corporation law and say, “everything that’s unfair from now on in corporate matters will be governed by Federal law.”"
1976.75-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1547.736,1564.34,"Well, what if Delaware had said, you may not eliminate minority stockholders in this manner and your client, they’d come along give a notice to these shareholders, hey we know it’s a violation of Delaware law and this is what the Delaware law says and this is what we are going to do."
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,1569.868,1573.034,I don’t think that would be 10b-5 case.
1976.75-1753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1578.159,1581.152,You’re not foreclosing the possibility of state remedies by that?
1976.75-1753,0,44779,william_r_glendon,,1581.152,1583.524,"Of course not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.75-1753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.243,1677.193,"Very well, Mr. Glendon."
1976.75-1753,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1680.942,1686.988,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3634.175,3640.934,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-1753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3663.378,3667.245,"Well, we assume don’t really that there was undervaluation for the purpose of -- that’s right."
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3667.245,3671.325,"For the purpose of the motion, we of course have to concede."
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3674.159,3681.441,"Now, but we also assume, don’t we, or we take as true the allegation that the majority stockholder knew it was worth more."
1976.75-1753,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3681.441,3681.911,Yes.
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3681.911,3684.591,"No, there was no such allegation."
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3705.529,3714.104,"Well, would your case be different if we took it as true that the majority stockholder did know it?"
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3714.104,3715.794,"Knew that there was a fraudulent, that would --"
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3715.794,3721.926,"No, not knew that it was fraudulent but knew that the stockholder didn’t know the any appraisal."
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3721.926,3723.402,And did not disclose it.
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.402,3733.11,"Well, they disclosed, it disclose all the facts, they had an appraisal from Morgan Stanley and yet they said that they put in this report -- the valuation was much higher."
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3733.11,3733.968,"Mr. Justice White, we are dealing with an intangible."
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3752.173,3756.524,"So, your answer to my last question is that it wouldn’t make any difference in your case."
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3764.748,3765.945,Yes.
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3765.945,3766.854,Or not?
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3766.854,3772.531,"Well, if the majority stockholder put out what he knew to be a fraudulent appraisal and didn’t disclose --"
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3772.531,3773.878,"Well, I know but that isn’t the case."
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3773.878,3775.676,But that’s what we’re talking about Mr. Justice White.
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3778.293,3784.147,"I know but let’s just assume this case is exactly the way it is, except for one thing --"
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3784.147,3784.635,Yes.
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3784.635,3791.422,-- and that is just add and assume that the majority stockholder knew that the stock was worth more.
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3791.422,3795.819,"That he would be -- then, I think, he would be misleading by not disclosing what he knew."
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3795.819,3796.69,"Well, but he does --"
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3796.69,3799.572,But he doesn’t have anything here to know anymore than what’s on the record.
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3799.572,3802.617,Was he supposed to disclose his opinion that it’s worth more or what?
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3802.617,3805.132,"No, I think in the terms of opinion, no."
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3807.04,3808.619,He put --
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3808.619,3814.573,"You can’t commit a fraud, I don’t believe, by an expression of an opinion, and particularly, in this area you have to --"
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3814.573,3818.382,He disclosed all the facts on the basis of which evaluation judgment would be made.
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3818.382,3819.284,Yes.
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3820.152,3822.845,"And on that basis, you say, it couldn’t be a 10b-5 violation?"
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3822.845,3823.743,That’s right.
1976.75-1753,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3825.25,3826.797,Whatever his private opinion on what’s the evaluation --
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3826.797,3828.573,"Yes, that’s right."
1976.75-1753,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3832.684,3833.912,Your time is up Mr. Glendon.
1976.75-1753,2,44779,william_r_glendon,,3833.912,3836.87,Alright.
1976.75-1753,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3836.87,3837.578,Thank you gentlemen.
