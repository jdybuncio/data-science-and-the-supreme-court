1969.595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.04,Argument this morning is number 595 that's Nelson against George.
1969.595,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,38.154,41.754,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.595,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,123.133,136.107,Mrs. Renne does the State of California have any option when another state places a detainer on a prisoner who is incarcerated in a California Institution?
1969.595,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,136.107,144.47,"It does Your Honor, under the Agreement on Detainer -- well, I have to answer this question in two ways, Your Honor."
1969.595,1,25106,george_a_cumming_jr,,1647.427,1650.181,Mr. Chief Justice and might it please the Court.
1969.595,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.431,1688.367,You're not suggesting this case is on all force with the case you're referring to?
1969.595,1,25106,george_a_cumming_jr,,1688.367,1692.085,"No I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3500.806,3504.011,Your Honor if I may briefly respond to two primary points.
1969.595,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3522.682,3526.012,"Well, I know that is the position you took earlier, Mrs. Renne."
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3526.012,3526.424,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1969.595,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3526.424,3530.224,But is it true that there is an allegation here that it was so you?
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3530.224,3531.323,"No, Your Honor."
1969.595,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3531.323,3532.185,"Well, that is not alleged in this?"
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3532.185,3533.561,"No, that is not alleged."
1969.595,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3533.561,3534.335,I see.
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3534.335,3539.464,As I understand there is some allegation that might affect his parole consideration.
1969.595,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3547.357,3550.439,"Well, well, yes even though that's not true."
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3559.459,3559.832,Oh!
1969.595,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3560.643,3562.789,"Well, why wasn't that been in this case?"
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3562.789,3574.016,"Because Your Honor, it's -- exhaustion of state remedies presupposes and the applicability of present habeas corpus relief."
1969.595,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3584.057,3585.995,"Yes, but that doesn't say that."
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3596.964,3603.269,"Well, we do think in this instance Your Honor that there hasn't been any showing of an attempt to exhaustion but that is correct."
1969.595,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3603.269,3615.726,"Well, then -- I come back then, why shouldn't this case go back to the District Court for initial determination now whether he has available state remedies whether in California or North Carolina?"
1969.595,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,3615.726,3628.787,"Because that presupposes that if there is some sort of habeas corpus jurisdiction in the District Court of California, Your Honor and we're unwilling, we don’t believe that that’s the correct law."
