1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"We'll hear argument next in 91-164, United States against Thompson/Center Arms Company."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,57.003,59.955,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,122.162,132.837,So that you can make the short-barreled rifle out of everything that comes in that kit?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,132.837,133.437,--Yes.
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.762,149.346,Which makes it into a potential rifle.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,149.346,152.798,"--That makes it into a weapon that is designed to be fired from the shoulder, undoubtedly."
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,152.798,154.083,What are the other pieces?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,154.083,160.737,"The other pieces are a longer barrel that can be substituted for the shorter barrel, and a fore-end, a wooden piece that fits under the barrel."
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,160.737,162.203,"And that wouldn't be covered, either."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,162.203,164.619,Those pieces... right.
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.359,181.429,"What the other side says is yes, somebody could attach the stock to the pistol, but that's not what it's sold for."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,193.254,202.878,"That's correct, but as far as the sawed-off rifle goes I think there's some important distinctions between a readily attachable shoulder stock that attaches right onto a pistol and a sawed-off rifle or shot-gun."
1991.91-164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.404,221.756,"Well, what if you sold it together with a saw?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,221.756,226.724,"Even if you sell it together with a saw, a saw is not itself a part of a... it's not a part of a rifle."
1991.91-164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.695,249.073,"Well, what if the person manufactured and sold an assembled rifle and an assembled pistol and they were interchangeable in their parts so that it could... theoretically these things could be broken apart and reassembled as a short-barreled rifle?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,249.073,251.358,"Well, I think that's actually the hardest case here."
1991.91-164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,267.516,268.301,"Well, so what's the answer?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,268.301,277.99,"The current position that ATF has taken, partly as a matter of its enforcement discretion, is that that is not a firearm if they're complete and fully assembled."
1991.91-164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.99,284.828,"But that's not perhaps logical in light of your legal argument here today, is it?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,284.828,287.195,"No, I don't... I wouldn't say that."
1991.91-164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,296.118,300.272,Is there an intent requirement under this statute?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,300.272,303.224,--The intent is actually right in the words of the statute.
1991.91-164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.061,315.179,"You don't have to have an intent as to barrel length, that it be a short-barreled--"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,315.179,315.796,--No.
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.862,373.967,"--The record certainly doesn't indicate that anybody... any... has anybody ever used this contraption, if I may call it, as a short-barreled rifle?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,373.967,376.519,There's no--
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.519,378.455,Has any sportsman ever used it that way?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,378.455,380.621,--I'm not aware whether any sportsman--
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.621,382.757,Has any criminal ever used it that way?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,382.757,385.109,--There's nothing in the record about a... that a criminal has used it.
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.109,387.744,Why would you want a shoulder-fired pistol?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,398.116,408.823,"I mean, essentially the prohibition on short-barrel rifles is based on the idea that a short-barrel rifle is more accurate than a rifle and yet more concealable than... I mean, more accurate--"
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.823,409.406,"Than a pistol, that's right."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,409.406,409.906,--than a pistol.
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.906,410.056,That's right.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,410.056,410.222,And more concealable--
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.222,410.522,Right.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,410.522,411.122,--than a rifle.
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.122,419.178,"So this one would be no more accurate than a pistol, I assume... the barrel is not any longer... but less concealable than a pistol."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,419.178,426.415,There's all... I don't think there's anything in the record as to precisely how accurate this would be or whether someone would or would not want to use this for criminal--
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.415,440.091,"But Mr. Feldman, are there criminal penalties for possessing... I mean, this is... as it comes before us it's a tax case, but is it not the case that the same provisions, the same definitions govern criminal liability for possession of this thing?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,440.091,441.058,--Yes.
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.058,444.876,And don't we usually apply a rule of lenity to criminal cases?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,444.876,449.613,"Well, let me actually... let me retract that yes and put it in two parts."
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.017,457.969,And do you concede it has to be interpreted the same way for both?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,457.969,459.469,The question of what is a firearm.
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.825,470.641,May or may not?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,473.693,478.645,"The position of the Government is that the only intent requirement is that you know that it's a firearm, that that puts you on--"
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.645,478.861,That's what I thought.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,478.861,480.347,"--I mean, excuse me, you know that it's a weapon."
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.347,480.597,Right.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,496.107,499.309,"Your Honor, I think that that would prove entirely too much."
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,515.068,524.959,"But haven't some of our cases held in the field of taxation that even though we're dealing with a tax case here, if there are criminal penalties then you apply the rule of lenity?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,524.959,531.113,I don't recall any that have specifically dealt with tax cases and the rule of lenity.
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.596,562.715,But don't... aren't you going to have to interpret it the same way in a criminal prosecution?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,562.715,567.952,"Again, you would have to... you certainly would have to interpret what is a firearm the same way in a criminal prosecution."
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.952,571.238,So why do you say those concerns aren't present here?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,577.908,593.519,"First of all, I think the argument that we're making is something that would be appropriate in a criminal case, but if... where you're addressing criminal cases, the criminal prohibitions... for instance there's a criminal prohibition against possessing an unregistered... an unregistered weapon that's required to be registered."
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.625,603.692,Although you deny that.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,603.692,605.494,It is our position that there's not--
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.494,605.894,It may.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,606.644,624.706,"--There's... currently the courts of appeals... most courts of appeals have held that the... for the criminal... in a criminal prosecution the intent requirement is that you know that it's a firearm, that that puts people on sufficient notice to know that they should check and see what the legal requirements are with respect to that weapon before they possess a firearm."
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,625.908,628.359,How do you deal with the Gould case?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,628.359,630.459,The Gold... excuse me.
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.459,644.202,"Well, Gould or Gold, G-o-u-l-d v. Gould, decided in 19... 1970, about... saying that statutes levying taxes establish a rule not to extend their provisions by implication."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,644.202,646.737,I think that... two ways.
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.724,654.524,So you're not extending it by implication.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,654.524,655.009,That's right.
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.852,674.554,"Well, has this always been the Government's position--"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,674.554,675.188,Yes.
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.188,676.256,--the one that you're now--
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,676.256,677.206,Yes.
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.8,708.858,"--So you don't think this is any different than if the only thing that was sold here was a kit with a stock and a rifle barrel... I mean, a short rifle barrel?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,713.31,715.262,I'm not sure if I understand the hypothetical.
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.546,727.585,"Let's assume that it had a stock and it had a short barrel, and whatever else that it would... necessary to make a short-barreled rifle."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,727.585,728.437,--That's right.
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.639,732.705,"That is the same case, isn't it?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,732.705,754.153,"And indeed, if the Federal circuit's interpretation of the statute were adopted, a criminal or a gang of criminals, or anyone in fact, could amass a cache of short-barrel rifles or other NFA weapons simply by buying them in a partially unassembled state, with one or two pieces missing, leaving them there in a warehouse or storehouse until they're ready to be used and then attaching the final piece and going out and using them."
1991.91-164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,754.153,761.241,"Well, except for the fact that in that case there's only one thing they would do with them if they did anything at all, whereas that is not true here."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,761.241,764.693,"Well, that may or may not be true in that case."
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.628,799.58,"The same horrible exists as long as the parts are interchangeable, whether they sell them that way or not."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,812.839,813.406,Receiver.
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.406,814.706,The receivers separately.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,818.824,836.267,"Yes, but weapons could be specifically designed and intended by the manufacturers to be... by a single manufacturer just precisely so they'd have, for instance, the maximum criminal utility and so that there's a piece or two that's missing when you purchase them so that technically they're some other weapon which someone may want to use for some other purpose at that time."
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,851.193,853.859,At what point does the manufacturer pay the tax?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,862.299,870.321,"I would certainly be willing to go along with what respondent put in its application to pay the tax, which is segregate as a unit."
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.321,875.559,"Well, does that mean when it puts it in its storehouse ready for shipment?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,875.559,875.809,Yes.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,888.782,899.34,"So that when the barrel comes off one assembly line and the stock off another assembly line, there's no tax, but then they owe you the tax when they put the two together in a box?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,900.874,901.957,--When they're associated together.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,917.6,930.659,"Well, but under your theory if they have an inventory with any number of stocks and any number of barrels at some point I suppose that they've got the potential of assembling a weapon--"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,930.659,931.576,--That's right.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,931.576,934.095,--for which the tax is required.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,934.095,945.319,"That's right, and when those parts are segregated as a unit... let me suggest another case, which is where what they're making is a full rifle and a full... and a pistol, and they're marketing them entirely separately."
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,961.579,969.649,"Well, suppose this kit is shipped as a complete rifle."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,976.421,980.373,If it is a long barrel it's just a long-barrel rifle and not a firearm.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.373,988.027,--So it's only the omission of the receiver that is the incident that requires the payment of the tax?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,988.027,990.027,I'm not sure I understand.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.812,997.364,"Well, you tax them now for having the kit, and the kit has the barrel and the stock."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,997.364,998.281,--That's right.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1013.105,1017.723,"Well, what... the kit now contains a barrel and a stock, correct?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1021.961,1022.244,"--Yes, that's correct."
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1036.201,1038.486,"Well, are the kit and the pistol sold together?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1038.486,1038.819,Yes.
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.473,1046.473,"Well, what is the receiver--"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1049.591,1054.043,The receiver is the part of the gun... firearm that contains the mechanism of the gun.
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.428,1061.899,"So you have three parts to a rifle, a stock, a receiver, and a barrel?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1061.899,1062.782,I think... yes.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1066.184,1070.254,And suppose they sold those three parts disassembled.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1071.92,1076.158,"Well, again, if the barrel were a short barrel it would be a short--"
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1076.158,1076.524,"No, no."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1092.084,1097.238,"--That conversion kit... the kit by itself that just contains those parts wouldn't be a firearm, because--"
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.238,1101.69,So it's only the absence of the receiver that makes it an illegal kit.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1101.69,1109.13,"--No, it's the presence... I don't mean to be quarreling with you on the hypothetical, but it's the presence of the pistol that makes it a complete kit."
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1117.734,1130.626,"All right, then let me ask a different way, and I guess if you have the disassembled pistol, all of the parts, and the disassembled rifle, all of the parts, and you sell them as two weapons, that's a violation in your view."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1130.626,1132.559,--Yeah.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1136.861,1138.713,All of the parts for each and they're sold together.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1138.713,1140.246,--That would also be a violation.
1991.91-164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1140.663,1151.352,"But if you had an assembled rifle and an assembled pistol which could be disassembled and reassembled into a short-barreled rifle, you say no violation."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1151.352,1157.589,"--I think that fact without more... again, I think that that's a hard case, because there are two... really two lines of reasoning there."
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.292,1192.929,"Mr. Feldman, I didn't understand... I didn't understand the position you were taking to be in accord with the answer you just gave."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1221.679,1225.281,If they're both disassembled and he's making the simultaneous--
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.281,1225.833,"Yes, right."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1225.833,1227.433,--sales to the same customer?
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.433,1228.435,To the same customer.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1228.435,1232.22,I think if there's knowledge that those parts can be reassembled as a short-barrel rifle--
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.22,1232.353,I see.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1238.673,1245.077,--I think it would depend if there's knowledge on everybody's part that those parts can be put together quickly and readily as a short-barrel rifle.
1991.91-164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.077,1249.213,"Unless it's a full... fully assembled pistol and a fully assembled rifle, then it doesn't matter."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1256.384,1272.061,"I think if they're fully assembled without more... again, if the store owner suggests to the customer I'm going to put them together for you but these... really it's the whole unit and this really should be made... you can go take this home, in fact you ought to if you want to make a short-barrel rifle, I think that that might raise a different issue."
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1279.815,1283.183,"Well, you... perhaps I misunderstood you."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1292.539,1294.206,As a general matter it's not.
1991.91-164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.825,1300.478,"Yes, except that with reference to every example you insert the word intent."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1300.644,1306.632,"No, I... first of all knowledge... as Justice White just mentioned, knowledge is what I would use, not intent."
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.725,1340.353,"Well, Mr. Feldman, we are... this is a question of statutory construction, which means what did Congress mean by these words, and don't you think it's relevant in inquiring about what Congress intended to cover?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1353.761,1357.481,"First of all, I'm not sure I would agree with your characterization about anybody in their right mind."
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.481,1365.319,"Well, I asked you awhile ago, the record... you have no record of anybody ever using this kit to make a short-barreled rifle."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1375.192,1376.376,I think it--
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.376,1380.93,"--for this purpose, but no one in history has ever used it for that purpose."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1380.93,1386.482,"--We haven't attempted to put in information in the record about this particular weapon, because in our view it's nothing."
1991.91-164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.482,1401.742,"Well, that may be so, but I just asked you isn't it relevant to what Congress might have intended to... if hardly anybody in his right mind would have thought this would ever be used as a short-barreled rifle?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1401.742,1406.694,--I think that what Congress thought about this particular weapon actually is not important.
1991.91-164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1424.488,1428.892,"Well, Mr. Feldman, let me, if I may, raise... that raises a definitional question."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1438.098,1438.648,That's correct.
1991.91-164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1438.648,1456.126,And you said it was not significant that the definition of rifle did not have any reference to unassembled parts simply because what Congress was doing when it included the unassembled parts within the meaning of machine gun was codifying prior judicial decisions and that's all it was doing.
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1457.376,1458.376,I think that's not quite right.
1991.91-164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1465.815,1481.657,"Why, then, at least to the extent that they were codifying, and to the extent that in your view the definition of rifle should include the unassembled possibilities anyway, why didn't they also overhaul the definition of rifle to make it very clear that your view was correct?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1481.657,1484.543,"They... well, actually I don't know why they didn't."
1991.91-164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1487.561,1497.703,"But what we're left with are two definitions, and I think one literally follows the other, doesn't it, in which the machine gun definition does refer to the unassembled parts and the rifle definition does not."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1497.703,1499.036,"That's correct, but--"
1991.91-164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1499.036,1509.059,"Anyone looking at that would say well, they can't mean that the unassembled components of a rifle, including possibly a short barrel, would be a rifle."
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1509.059,1510.761,--I think when Congress was--
1991.91-164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1510.761,1512.294,But isn't that so?
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1517.581,1522.234,--I think that would be a misleading way to look at it in this case.
1991.91-164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1523.251,1528.722,"Well, it might be misleading, but isn't that the way that probably a person hitting the statute cold would read it?"
1991.91-164,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1528.722,1530.674,--I'm not sure that they would.
1991.91-164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.652,1601.52,"Very well, Mr. Feldman."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1602.936,1606.388,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.969,1631.04,May I ask you a question that I intended to ask your opponent but just didn't get a chance to get in?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1633.573,1635.408,It's a 22 rim fire caliber.
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.408,1636.091,It's just a 22.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1636.091,1637.141,It's a minor caliber.
1991.91-164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1651.749,1654.634,Do you have to change the receiver in order to do that?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1654.634,1656.236,"No, you don't, Your Honor."
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.483,1678.766,What's rim fire?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1680.801,1693.093,"Well, rim fire cartridge is the smallest cartridge made, and it only means that the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge to make it go off, whereas most bigger calibers have a center fire which hits the primer--"
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.093,1693.559,I see.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1694.143,1694.945,--in the middle.
1991.91-164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1706.168,1719.81,"I want you to get to this part of the argument, but I thought that if you had two receivers... the Government responded to our questions that there would still be liability if they were disassembled."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1719.81,1725.047,--That's post hoc attorney talk in this Court for the first time.
1991.91-164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1726.047,1726.18,All right.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1730.265,1731.898,--The agency has never taken that--
1991.91-164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.898,1732.198,--in 1943?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1732.198,1733.781,"--I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy."
1991.91-164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.781,1735.65,When did the agency take this position?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1735.65,1742.654,For the first time in 1985 the agency took the position that you could have a complete pistol and a complete carbine.
1991.91-164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.406,1777.91,So your understanding of the case is that it is the absence of the receiver that causes... in the kit that causes the problem here.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1777.91,1781.028,"That's accurate, and that's throughout the record in this case."
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.218,1814.349,"And it would create some problems if they constitute an impermissible firearm assembled or disassembled but do not constitute it assembled, because as you say, there are possession laws as well, and every time the owner who buys these things assembled, which wouldn't be a violation, when he takes the two apart to clean them he is suddenly in possession of an unlawful firearm."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1814.349,1817.285,"Not only that... that's accurate, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.365,1839.749,May I ask you a question in that regard?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1850.756,1857.862,"That's getting a lot closer to one, and the reason is that the definition of rifle does include the term intended to be fired from the shoulder."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.849,1865.832,"Well, I understand a manufacturer doesn't want to take a lot of chances."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1871.086,1875.574,"Well, when we apply the rule of... let me distinguish two kinds of rifles."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.574,1876.374,Well--
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1876.374,1879.191,"Of course, the answer is yes for a certain type... yes."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1879.191,1880.125,--You'd say that would be yes.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1880.125,1880.658,It would be--
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1880.658,1881.291,"Well, then, why--"
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1881.291,1883.16,--If it's an instantly attachable shoulder stock.
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1883.16,1886.029,--Why does it stop being a rifle because they put a fourth item into the package?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1886.029,1894.868,My yes relates to the pistol and instantly attachable shoulder stock that those revenue rulings Mr. Feldman was talking about were talking about.
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.676,1909.545,"Well, I assume it's never been put together before."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1918.067,1919.417,"--Well, if this--"
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.417,1931.66,"I understand you're saying, well, it's past practice and we're willing to go along with it as sort of an administrative interpretation of the statute, but if we just look at plain language, it seems to me if we adopt your view of the plain language, that kit is not a firearm."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1931.66,1948.336,"--When we apply the rule of lenity to an ambiguous statute I agree that that would not be a firearm, and when we looked at the contrasting definitions, the three other NFA firearms that have combinations of parts definitions and the absence of that language here and the definition of make here as including putting together."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.824,1957.026,"It seems to me your argument applies equally to my hypothetical, that's what I'm saying to you."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1973.253,1974.52,"Well, I don't think so."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.959,1986.176,"Well, no, I'm not talking about something that requires sawing off."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,1995.184,1999.469,My view would have to be no when we construe the statute strictly.
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.469,2007.955,"If we decide the case the way you ask us to, I think we'll have to say... we'll have to say no as to all those hypotheticals... the Uzi gun and all the other things the Government talks about."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2007.955,2019.28,"But notice, though, that the statute says, intended to be fired from the shoulder, and if those parts are intended to be assembled and fired from the shoulder with a barrel less than 16 inches, it is by definition a short-barrel rifle."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.28,2020.465,Even though it's not yet been made.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2020.465,2027.886,"It's a lot closer to being made, and if that intent element is there then a prosecutor would be over that hurdle."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.308,2042.212,"Well, suppose you put an instruction in the assembly I describe and say don't fire this from the shoulder, only fire it from the hip."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2048.532,2049.482,"--Well, but the definition--"
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.482,2050.234,Like a xxx rifle.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2050.234,2055.554,"--includes... that's an objective standard as to what a shoulder stock is, and that's in the--"
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.554,2057.538,"Well, but then that takes your intent out of the case, it seems to me."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2062.309,2064.494,--That's not what the statute said.
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.016,2086.324,"Well, but most of the courts of appeals as I understand it have an intent requirement that they must know there's a violation, that, you know, it's a firearm xxx, which the tax statute doesn't have the same intent requirement in it."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2086.324,2087.739,"Well, not completely."
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.011,2156.802,"Well, it's not just the purchases of the past kits, it's any purchasers in the future who happened to purchase the rifle separately and then the pistol separately and then disassembled them."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2156.802,2178.715,"If what the Government has said for the first time here today... if that's accurate, then that's a real problem, because Thompson/Center has been marketing these kits... not kits, but complete carbines and complete pistols... since 1985 when BATF Director Steven Higgins ruled that that was not an NFA firearm, that one person in possession of both complete guns does not possess an NFA firearm."
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.427,2201.264,"Justice... well, how would you address Justice Stevens' problem, though?"
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2222.677,2243.341,"I don't think Congress... well, it certainly hasn't passed such a law, but I would say that that's why it's important, in applying law to facts as we're doing here, to look at the facts of the specific case, and if we interpret the statute narrowly to exclude this item from the National Firearms Act, we don't do anything about all these potential hypotheticals that the Government has raised."
1991.91-164,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2257.35,2264.004,"Mr. Halbrook, may I go back to one of the hypos that I think Justice Stevens referred to, and I'm not sure that I understood your answer."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2284.084,2285.534,That's accurate.
1991.91-164,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2285.951,2290.404,--because machine gun includes... specifically includes reference to unassembled parts.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2290.404,2291.154,--Absolutely.
1991.91-164,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2313.265,2315.049,"No, but isn't the... maybe I'm missing something."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2342.984,2354.092,"--Well, Justice Souter's question is... the answer is yes, that the easy answer to that question is that an Uzi machine gun is defined as a combination of parts from which a machine gun can be assembled."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.28,2363.914,"Now, that's not the answer to my hypothetical."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2365.399,2386.313,"Your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, as I understand it is if we had a rifle, we had a shoulder stock not attached to the receiver, perhaps, and a barrel not attached to the receiver, and it's a short barrel, then that's getting a lot closer to being a short-barrel rifle because of the intended-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder standard."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.265,2394.086,"I really would be grateful to you, and I just tried... I don't want to use up everyone else's time."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2396.436,2399.572,--If it's packaged and intended to be sold together and--
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2399.572,2405.809,"Three parts sold separately, barrel... short barrel, a stock... a shoulder stock, and a receiver."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2407.859,2410.261,"--Justice Stevens, that's one of those questions that the answer--"
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.261,2410.945,Can it be yes or no?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2410.945,2413.13,"--is maybe, because the statute doesn't clearly apply to that."
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.13,2421.903,"You said awhile ago that construction of the statute would mean that this is not a rifle, short-barreled rifle, until it's assembled."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2423.938,2427.89,The term rifle does not include combination of parts.
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.89,2429.009,Okay.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2429.009,2430.042,That's a--
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.042,2436.762,So it would not be a rifle as long as it's sold in three parts; isn't that right?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2437.679,2439.212,"--If I was defending a criminal case, that's what I'd argue."
1991.91-164,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2447.368,2447.968,xxx.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2464.329,2469.198,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, my answer to that's going to be no, that that's not a rifle under the statute."
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.198,2472.851,"Yes, that's what you... exactly you said before."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2476.086,2478.338,"Well, it's just a question--"
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.338,2479.055,Our problems are your problems.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2479.055,2480.855,--in the one in the case at bar.
1991.91-164,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.311,2681.5,"Now, Mr. Feldman says that the administrative constructions go back to 1961, I think, that support the Government's view."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2686.385,2698.86,"Well, the 1961 revenue rulings only say that a pistol with an instantly attachable shoulder stock and no long barrel to give the combination a non-NFA purpose, that that's a short-barrel rifle."
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2704.33,2708.651,"But you say that's wrong, don't you?"
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2708.651,2710.484,"Well, I say--"
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.484,2711.234,You just said a minute ago--
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2711.234,2717.221,"--That's tougher than Justice Stevens' facts, because at least he's talking about three parts being disassembled."
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.221,2717.673,--Here's two.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2717.673,2721.792,"Here's two, and it's an instantly attachable shoulder stock."
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.792,2729.73,"Exactly, but under your theory I would suppose that is not a... that is not covered by the statute, because it isn't assembled."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2729.73,2731.464,Well--
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.464,2733.016,Yes or no?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2733.016,2736.151,--If they're right there together--
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.151,2738.17,Not assembled.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2742.205,2752.311,"--And if it goes together just like that in an instant like the revenue rulings in 1961, the answer is that I think that's getting really close to being a short-barrel rifle, but again--"
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.311,2756.298,"Well, close... you know, in some contexts close isn't enough."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2756.298,2758.481,"--That's correct, too."
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.189,2772.991,Do you accept that... those revenue rulings or not?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2772.991,2774.843,I accept the--
1991.91-164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.843,2777.211,As applied to exactly what they applied to.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2777.211,2782.596,"--I would, except that a shoulder... yes."
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2786.5,2791.435,"Mr. White... Justice White keeps pulling you back onto the wagon, you keep falling off again."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2798.207,2799.857,"Well, Justice Scalia, it's--"
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2799.857,2802.326,You mean you don't want to attack them.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2805.294,2815.55,"--I would... I have some disagreements with them on due process notice questions for those reasons, but they're very distinguishable from this case."
1991.91-164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.894,2831.512,You'd have to have... you'd have to use a different theory than the one you're using.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2836.916,2847.871,"I would concur with that, that the intended to be fired from the shoulder, the design part of the definition... the design is the manufacturer's purpose, really, and--"
1991.91-164,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2847.871,2853.759,What do you say is the intent requirement under the statute?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2853.759,2882.378,"--The intended-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder part of rifle... the definition of rifle, and we say it's exactly what it says, a requirement that the Government prove that the item is intended to be fired from the shoulder, so that, for example, if here the only thing that's ever being made is a long-barrel rifle, 21-inch barrel, and a pistol with a 10-inch... I'm sorry, the rifle has a 21-inch barrel, the pistol has a 10-inch barrel... that's the way those parts are intended to be used."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.631,2916.415,"No, but you have... the two out of three are met in the hypotheticals."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2930.342,2932.692,"Yes, you do."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.692,2946.352,"So those arguments really don't carry the day for you, it seems to me, unless you're willing to say those revenue rulings are wrong, but you might well be right on the intend-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder because this can be used either way, with the pistol handle or with the shoulder stock."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2946.352,2949.22,"And also the strong factual difference, too, though."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.29,2961.61,"Yes, but when you buy a lot of Christmas toys that you think you're... readily assemble, and it take longer than that."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2962.06,2962.66,Right.
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.729,2968.097,"I mean, you can't really rely on the difference between 5 minutes and just plugging it in, I don't think."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,2968.097,2974.518,"--Well, I think the instant attachability at least is a factor, the fact that it's designed and intended to be done."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.846,3207.582,May I ask just one question about the typical practice in the industry when you sell long-barreled rifles?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,3215.838,3217.707,"They would be sold assembled, normally."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.707,3219.04,Assembled or disassembled?
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,3219.04,3219.34,Assembled.
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3219.34,3220.006,They would be.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,3220.006,3221.006,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.468,3245.336,"No, I understand that, but I thought sometimes the barrel might just be sold... that there'd be in two parts."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,3248.372,3251.407,"Well, it's not in the record, but--"
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.407,3252.776,--I shouldn't ask you about it.
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,3252.776,3255.228,--A... perhaps I shouldn't answer.
1991.91-164,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.228,3256.561,"Well, I'm glad to have the answer."
1991.91-164,1,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,3256.561,3264.166,"Oh, if I may answer, a shotgun sometimes would be sold with the barrel disattached for shipment because it... to make it not so long."
1991.91-164,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3322.02,3323.788,"Thank you, Mr. Halbrook."
1991.91-164,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3326.038,3328.34,I'd like to just make a couple of brief points.
1991.91-164,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.24,3483.192,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
