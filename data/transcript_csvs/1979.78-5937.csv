1979.78-5937,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,76.226,"We will hear arguments next in 78-5937, Ventura E. Ybarra against Illinois."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,80.098,83.545,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-5937,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,263.811,275.918,"Independent of the statute, Mr. Goldberg, if the officer observed factors which would have warranted a patdown search under a Terry, what would you say then?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,275.918,281.955,"If he had observed factors which would have warranted patdown in Terry, he could have performed it without the authority of the statute."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,284.335,290.19,"Mr. Goldberg, does your argument depend at all on a question of degree?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,323.667,335.563,"Well, the answer to that, I think, is that the premises are smaller and more private, and the number of people there are less than the reasonable suspicion, goes greater that they are involved in the criminal activity, necessarily."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.853,348.959,But it is a line-drawing process?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,348.959,354.878,"Necessarily a line would have to be drawn somewhere, but that line, I think, is provided in Terry v. Ohio."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.207,374.226,"If they had probable cause, there is no doubt they could search them."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,378.405,385.182,"Well, in your exposes hypothetical, of course, that would be a question of probability of danger to the officers."
1979.78-5937,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,444.348,448.188,"If you were representing the bartender, would you be making the same argument?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,448.188,458.211,"Well, the bartender was named in the warrant, Greg, and so I would be able to make this argument."
1979.78-5937,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.211,479.476,"Well, would you say that if it was found by a State court that there was reasonable suspicion that people in that particular bar might well be armed, could the patrons be patted down just for weapons, while they made the search -- before they made the search of the premises?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,479.476,485.052,"If there was reasonable suspicion regarding the first patdown, you can be patted down, and there simply wasn't here."
1979.78-5937,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,485.052,486.196,For a weapon?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,486.196,487.395,For a weapon.
1979.78-5937,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.395,496.196,"And then if a weapon were found, and assuming the possession of that weapon concealed on the person, was a violation of Illinois law, then there could be a general search."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,496.196,502.487,Right.
1979.78-5937,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.007,543.685,Isn't it a little bit broader than that?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,558.583,559.116,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,582.108,585.329,"Isn't that often true of any bar, though."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,592.447,604.021,"Well, I think the State's assertion is that when in walking into the bar the patrons gave up their expectation of privacy; they walked into a bar where they should have known narcotics going on."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.201,621.786,But you don't challenge the validity of the warrant for the search of the premises?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,621.786,623.459,"No, there was no need for it."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.459,632.315,Well -- Which said that their reason for searching it was that it was an open and notorious place for exchanging narcotics.
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,632.315,633.985,No.
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.082,675.288,"Well, what do you say that the searching officer could have searched, if he could not have searched the people in the bar?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,675.288,678.336,"He could have searched the premises, that is --"
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,678.336,679.165,Whereabouts on the premises?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,679.165,685.088,"He could have searched behind the bar, he could have searched objects on the premises, and he could have searched the bartender, Greg."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.088,686.312,Why not the people?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,686.312,691.501,"Because the people, by virtue of being there, did not become part of the premises."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.991,707.76,What if someone had a market basket they were wheeling out of the bar?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,707.76,710.489,"If that were his personal possession, it is not part of the premises."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.404,717.009,"So, you say it has to be almost a fixture in the real property sense of the word?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,717.009,725.2,"Well, it has to be something which the officers could reasonably believe could contain the contraband."
1979.78-5937,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.666,759.124,This warrant authorized the search of the premises and the bartender.
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,765.788,770.959,"No, I think in that instance, it would be a general warrant."
1979.78-5937,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.111,790.147,"Supposing, unlike the complaint here, this complaint had said that there was open notorious dealing and that persons in the premises regularly go in and acquire some drugs, and so forth and so on."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,795.748,803.829,"If it said, for example, that the patrons, among them Ventura Ybarra, were involved in the criminal activity, I would have no argument."
1979.78-5937,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.771,831.922,Nobody except the bartender.
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,831.922,839.755,"The only person suspected is the bartender, and it appears from the record that the bartender wasn't even there when the warrant was executed."
1979.78-5937,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,881.998,887.347,"What about paragraph 4, of the application for the search warrant?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,887.347,899.109,"Yes, ""that the informant advised me that over the weekend of 28-29 February he had a conversation with Greg, and was advised that Greg would have heroin for sale on Monday, March 1, 1976."""
1979.78-5937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1071.98,1073.124,What is this about Greg?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1075.022,1081.039,"The record does not indicate that he was there, and there was no testimony that he was present."
1979.78-5937,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1089.846,1092.014,You mean there was a bar without a bartender?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1092.014,1104.952,"Well, apparently, there was another bartender there by the name of Peggy Miller who -- on whom the warrant was served, but Greg apparently was not there, the person who was dealing narcotics."
1979.78-5937,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1202.024,1216.798,"In your submission, the search would -- had the search revealed the heroin the first time around it would be just as unlawful as you contend with respect to the second?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1216.798,1236.468,"Well, if the officer, in patting someone down, had found heroin, and, of course, in patting someone down it would be extremely difficult to find heroin, since you are limited to the outer garments, but if the officer had found heroin on the initial patdown, it would have been equally illegal because that initial patdown was illegal."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.14,1265.06,"In the Illinois Appellate Division opinion on page 80 of the Appendix, it says, ""In the first patdown of the defendant at the bar, a cigarette package with objects in it was felt by the officer."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1286.842,1295.404,"I would say so, because the feeling of a cigarette pack with objects in it cannot logically give rise to any suspicion that a person has some contraband on his person."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.404,1305.372,"In spite of the search warrant saying this is a place where heroin is frequently bought and sold, and that this is a normal way of carrying heroin?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1305.372,1309.483,"Well, the search warrant doesn't allege that a cigarette pack is a normal way of carrying heroin."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1337.655,1342.463,But it doesn't say that they patted down and felt a cigarette package with cigarettes in it.
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1353.621,1358.987,"No, but the officer didn't feel those six tinfoil packets of heroin in the initial patdown."
1979.78-5937,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.969,1379.563,He didn't even know it was a cigarette package.
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1379.563,1390.967,"Well, I think he indicated, at one point in his testimony, that he felt nothing, and then later on, in response to a question by the Prosecutor, he said he felt what he thought was a cigarette pack."
1979.78-5937,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.967,1392.126,It might not have been.
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1392.126,1394.102,It might not have been a cigarette package.
1979.78-5937,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.102,1401.371,"Mr. Goldberg, you made emphasis on the difference between, what you call, the first search and the second search."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1404.656,1408.669,Variously it is described in the record as three minutes or ten minutes.
1979.78-5937,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.669,1415.941,"And I suppose the primary concern was for the presence of weapons, wasn't it?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1430.367,1432.761,We are faulting him as to both.
1979.78-5937,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.944,1464.219,"No reason to suspect criminal activity, despite the contents of the application for the search warrant?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1464.219,1471.869,"No reason with respect to the first patdown to suspect that any of these patrons were involved, by his own admission, by his own testimony."
1979.78-5937,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.869,1476.933,Are not violence and gunplay rather common in narcotics transactions?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1476.933,1481.81,"I imagine that in narcotics transactions violence and gunplay may be involved, but --"
1979.78-5937,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.81,1485.169,You imagine?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1485.169,1500.529,"I accept that it is, and I accept that under circumstances in which search warrants for narcotics are being executed there may be many circumstances in which the police find it necessary to pat down all the people there."
1979.78-5937,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.24,1594.455,"Suppose the officer testified -- since we are getting into hypothetical situations -- Suppose he had testified that he felt a package with some objects in which he thought might be the little packages of heroin, but that he decided to make no issue of it on the first search to see whether the subject would try to pass the heroin on to somebody else and then get two customers, instead of one, on possession charges."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1594.455,1603.753,"That would obviously be a much stronger case for the State, if the officer suspected as a result of the patdown that the person possessed the narcotics named in the warrant."
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.564,1631.947,Is the test reasonable suspicion or reasonable and actual suspicion?
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1631.947,1639.728,I think the test for a patdown is a reasonably articulable suspicion.
1979.78-5937,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.728,1642.161,Suppose the officer in this case was just dumb.
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1649.618,1651.228,It certainly is an objective test.
1979.78-5937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1663.233,1670.553,"You are talking about a reasonable suspicion, or however you verbalize it, about a weapon, not about narcotics."
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1670.553,1671.943,About narcotics.
1979.78-5937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.27,1696.374,"The rationale of this case, as it comes to us -- the basis for the decision was on the statute, that if you got a warrant to search the premises you can search people on it, is that right?"
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1696.374,1697.852,That was the conclusions that --
1979.78-5937,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.852,1702.082,It wasn't the rationale that there was reasonable suspicion of weapons.
1979.78-5937,0,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,1702.082,1702.292,No.
1979.78-5937,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.786,1728.968,Mr. Noel
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1728.968,1731.177,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1816.891,1820.588,How could they be attacked after they patted them down?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1820.588,1821.894,"One of the issues here, Your Honor --"
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1821.894,1826.055,How could they have been attacked after they patted them down?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1826.055,1827.221,They couldn't.
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1827.221,1827.823,They could not?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1827.823,1828.52,No.
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1828.52,1832.124,"So, you don't have any justification for the second search at all, do you?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1832.124,1837.148,It is our argument -- and we are agreeing that they should have been patted down the first time.
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.34,1855.374,Could you have patted down a man coming in the door?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1863.82,1870.569,"There are circumstances on which a patdown for weapons, I think, could be justified by a person coming in the door."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1886.173,1888.078,Mine did not include a nun.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1891.036,1895.586,"But my point is, it would depend on the character of this individual coming in the door."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1915.81,1919.646,"Certainly, if it were Greg coming in the door, a patdown would be individual?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1919.646,1923.353,"Yes, I think so, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.353,1934.673,"Mr. Noel, I am puzzled by your saying very say he's just dressed in work clothes like the other people in the bar -- why would you treat him any differently than someone already in?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1935.684,1940.826,"Well, I think the first thing, Your Honor, is that in most situations the man probably would not be allowed to walk in the door."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.682,1953.051,"Well, now you are changing -- But if the question is assumed someone is permitted to walk in, wouldn't he be fungible with the other customers, if he just wore the same kind of clothes and everything?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1957.44,1966.542,"Well, perhaps not rare, but I think it would require an articulation of more than we would articulate of the people in the bar."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.542,1971.472,"What do you have about a person in the bar, other than the fact he obviously walked in?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1973.213,1982.963,"Well, he is present around the bar, and he is on the location where the police officers are going to be forced to subject themselves to some risk in order to carry out the search warrant."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1982.963,1987.724,"But so is the person walking in the door, as soon as he gets across the threshold."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,1987.724,1990.558,"That's true, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2007.474,2009.971,But you don't say any of those things about the people who previously walked through the door.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2009.971,2011.338,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2012.764,2014.907,But before you made the initial patdown.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2014.907,2021.59,"In the initial patdown, Ventura Ybarra wa wearing heavy clothing which was capable of concealing a weapon."
1979.78-5937,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.624,2049.969,You can reflect on that until 1:00 o'clock.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2052.562,2054.235,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.754,2086.917,"Are you depending the reasoning of the court below, which, as I take it, had nothing to do with whether there was a patdown or not?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2094.898,2100.109,"We do defend the reasoning of the court below, which did not rely on a frisk."
1979.78-5937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.838,2122.868,And that would certainly distinguish the people who were there from the people who arrived after the search began.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2122.868,2124.312,"Up to that point, yes."
1979.78-5937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.059,2150.283,"That's a lot of factual -- has some fact-finding in it, hasn't it?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2154.837,2161.015,"I think that -- Does Your Honor refer to fact-finding with regard to the public interest need, and that sort of thing?"
1979.78-5937,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2225.671,2235.195,"Even if this Court hadn't decided the Terry case as it did, your position, I take it, is that under this statute all of these steps were appropriate?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2238.871,2245.218,"We don't rely so much on the statute for the frisk, Your Honor, because we don't feel that we have to."
1979.78-5937,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2257.779,2263.872,"I am not suggesting you can't rely on Terry in part, but primarily you are drawing on the statutory authority here?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2263.872,2266.225,"Your Honor, we make two completely alternative arguments."
1979.78-5937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.571,2303.897,Excuse me.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2307.943,2309.865,It was not directly presented to the Appellate Court.
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.865,2312.861,And was never decided?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2312.861,2314.737,It was never decided in so many words.
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.22,2322.312,The first point.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2322.312,2323.811,It was never decided specifically.
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2323.811,2329.379,Was it presented?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2331.63,2339.947,It was raised in the testimony and presentation of the agent witness at the suppression hearing and at the trial.
1979.78-5937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.393,2355.127,Was it -- The State never defended on that ground?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2355.127,2358.01,"The State never briefed that point, that's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2397.972,2404.85,"It seems to me that when the Illinois Appellate Court relied on the second section, it implicitly rejected the first argument."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2410.956,2420.271,"I don't think that's accurate, Your Honor, because they simply had never been briefed on the first point, on the frisk point, and they simply didn't address it because it was not raised."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2420.271,2423.365,"But the statute was called to their attention, including both sections of it."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2423.365,2429.015,"That's correct, but the State's theory in the Appellate Court was simply on Subsection (b), Search for Narcotics."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2435.089,2441.474,"But if your frisk theory is valid, you would also entitled to rely on Subsection (a), I would think."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2447.12,2448.059,"I would agree, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.55,2475.223,Isn't the predicate to relying on Terry some finding that the officer reasonably feared that the suspect was armed?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2475.223,2476.773,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1979.78-5937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.773,2479.361,Is there any fact-finding like that in this record?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2479.361,2482.523,"Yes, Your Honor, there is."
1979.78-5937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.523,2487.231,Why was it you never relied on Terry?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2487.231,2488.814,"I don't know why they weren't presented, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.228,2501.428,"Well, I know, but if it was never presented -- How could any court have addressed the predicate to Terry, if the Terry argument was never made?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2501.428,2511.261,"Your Honor, the testimony of the agent is quite clear as to what he felt was the danger presented by the patrons in the bar and why he made the first patdown."
1979.78-5937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2611.81,2636.361,"If analytically probable cause will justify a search either for weapons or for contraband, why won't reasonable suspicion justify a patdown, either for weapons or contraband--putting to one side the Terry case?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2636.361,2643.465,"I would agree that our position would be that both are reasonable; both are good positions, but they would be for different reasons."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2692.961,2699.165,"Mr. Noel, on the balancing test, no guns were found in this case?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2699.165,2700.138,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2700.138,2701.936,No weapons of any kind?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2701.936,2702.875,That's correct.
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2702.875,2705.717,"So, you could be wrong?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2705.717,2707.46,"What is required, Your Honor, is not a certainty."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2708.757,2713.608,How many people did you find with dope in this place?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2713.608,2721.231,"In this place, there were two separate bags of marijuana found, on different people, I believe."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.231,2722.58,You believe?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2724.463,2727.942,"The only thing we have is the return from the search warrant, which lists the items."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2731.902,2735.275,I can't presume things in criminal cases.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2735.275,2737.996,"Your Honor, we can take reasonable inferences from the facts."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.619,2743.363,Your reasonable inference is that a person in a bar has a gun.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2747.22,2754.816,But that does not determine whether or not the officer was capable of having a reasonable belief under Terry before he made the search.
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.908,2758.341,You keep pointing at Terry.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2763.495,2764.92,Nothing.
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2766.174,2768.501,"And this man was arrested for dope, not a weapon."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2768.501,2771.313,"But the first search of him, Your Honor, was for weapons."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2771.313,2774.951,Wouldn't it be an extension of Terry to apply it to dope?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2774.951,2790.876,"No, Your Honor, we feel that, rather than being an extension or change of Terry, all that we are asking here is an explanation of the Terry principle and an application to it -- of it, rather -- to narcotics search warrant situations, recognizing that general background information --"
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.876,2793.916,There was nothing in Terry about dope.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2793.916,2795.021,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2795.021,2797.935,This man was casing the joint to rob it.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2797.935,2801.314,But Terry has been applied to many other situations than armed robbery.
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2818.546,2824.042,But this man didn't have an unexpired license or anything.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2827.982,2831.56,"That's correct, Your Honor, a place of business in which there was open and notorious narcotics traffic."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.56,2835.609,Had it been raided?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2846.924,2849.736,"Your Honor, that was the purpose of this particular search."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2849.736,2853.867,"Well, he knows now."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2855.874,2864.469,"I think, Your Honor, what we find after the frisk is made has no bearing on whether or not there was reasonable suspicion before the frisk was made."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2864.469,2870.753,May I also take recognition of the fact that you found dope didn't justify the search?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2870.753,2872.396,"First search, no, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2872.396,2876.504,"Didn't justify either search, in and of itself."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2879.541,2880.226,"No, but the --"
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2880.226,2881.286,Did it?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2881.286,2882.21,"Of course not, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2882.21,2883.02,"You are not trying for that, are you?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,2883.02,2883.94,No.
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3007.006,3012.444,"And then when they didn't find any, that was the end of it, wasn't it, under Terry?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3017.263,3026.246,"It wasn't the end of it in Ybarra, because in the course of the patdown they felt -- Agent Johnson felt the cigarette pack with --"
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3026.246,3031.359,"No weapon, nothing that he could possibly think was a weapon, is that correct?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3031.359,3050.903,"But under the lower court decisions which have dealt with this problem, it is held that if they obtain, in the course of a frisk, reasonable cause -- if they feel something which gives them probable cause, rather, to believe that the objects of a warrant are in a pocket, rather than a weapon, they are allowed to operate on this."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3070.835,3078.523,"That's true about many provisions of the Constitution, isn't it, including the Fifth Amendment guarantee against compulsory self-incrimination?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3093.778,3101.094,"I would say, Your Honor, that it is an entirely different quality of rights that's been treated entirely differently by the courts."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3166.293,3174.654,"Mr. Noel, I don't mean to keep going over the same point, but your case really depends almost entirely on paragraph 3 of the complaint for a search warrant."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3181.869,3190.543,"Well, in paragraph 4, also, Your Honor, excuse me, in which it is mentioned to the informant that there is going to be offered for sale at the tavern on march 1st --"
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3190.543,3193.034,"That he would have it for sale, presumably to the informant."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3193.034,3195.007,Yes.
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3195.007,3202.852,But there isn't a single reference in here to anyone ever having observed heroin change hands in that tavern.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3202.852,3205.13,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3224.557,3230.897,"Well, there is equally an inference that the informant could go in on March 1st and get a packet from the bartender."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3230.897,3232.118,"I wouldn't agree, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3241.939,3249.013,"The informant had been in the tavern on ten other occasions, but it doesn't say he observed tinfoil on each of those occasions."
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3249.013,3260.171,"Your Honor, this was not written by legal scholars, but it does say ""has been in the tavern on at the least ten other occasions and has observed the tinfoil packets on Greg and in a drawer behind the bar."""
1979.78-5937,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3284.092,3291.475,"The Court of Appeals in its opinion at page 80 of the Appendix says, ""No objection is made to the warrant itself."""
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3299.963,3303.844,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3303.844,3308.123,But they did challenge the right of the warrant to search this man.
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3308.123,3309.927,That is correct.
1979.78-5937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3309.927,3313.464,Is that the point that is before us?
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3313.464,3319.903,"That's one of the -- certainly the ruling of the Appellate Court below, and it is certainly one of the points that is before you, yes."
1979.78-5937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3324.577,3328.398,"Mr. Noel, just a matter of curiosity, whatever happened to Greg?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3328.398,3332.704,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1979.78-5937,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.704,3334.948,"He wasn't even present, was he?"
1979.78-5937,1,36413,melbourne_a_noel_jr,,3334.948,3338.64,"We are not sure of that, but the indication is that he was not."

1979.78-5937,2,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,3564.817,3566.873,Thank you.
1979.78-5937,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3617.577,3625.512,"How about the transcript at page 9, at the bottom of it, where it says, ""What happened during the patdown, if anything?"""
1979.78-5937,2,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,3632.497,3639.608,That gets to the other point of whether there was probable cause or reason for suspicion for its second intrusion.
1979.78-5937,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3651.108,3656.826,"Yes, but that would at least establish a subjective belief on his part."
1979.78-5937,2,16098,alan_d_goldberg,,3658.972,3659.536,Right.
1979.78-5937,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3689.441,3690.324,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
