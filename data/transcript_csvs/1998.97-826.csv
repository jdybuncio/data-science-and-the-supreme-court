1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.972,"We'll hear argument now in a number of consolidated cases, 97-826, AT&T Corporation v. Iowa Utilities Board, et cetera, et cetera."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,30.28,33.092,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.345,112.784,"But, General Waxman, 201(b)... you find before that, of course, naturally 201(a), and there it says, it shall be the duty of every common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,118.139,121.772,"No, I don't, Mr. Chief Justice, and for a variety of reasons."
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.442,144.246,But you think its plain meaning means it should extend beyond the section in which it's found?
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,144.246,152.721,--I think that it means... section 201(a) is... itself is limited to intrastate and foreign commerce.
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.055,157.474,"Yes, but--"
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,157.474,159.687,And I think it should be interpreted according to its terms.
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.687,171.445,"--But, you know, if this were a general thing that were to extend throughout the Federal communications statutes, why would you find it tucked away here at the very end of section 201(b)?"
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,171.445,173.696,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, two responses."
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.534,193.688,"Well, but doesn't that suggest that each of those grants is limited to the sections in which they're found?"
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,193.688,223.087,"I don't think it does, and moreover, with respect to 201(b), it's clear that Congress in 1996 had this section specifically in mind because section 251(i) of the 1996 amendments, which is entitled Savings Provision, specifically says that nothing in this act shall be deemed to limit... nothing in section 251 shall be deemed to limit or impair the applicability of the provisions of section 201."
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.901,236.527,"But... but if shall not be deemed to impair 201, 201 contains (a) as well as (b)."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,236.527,236.875,--That's true.
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.875,238.928,And it could be read as a limitation on (b).
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,238.928,252.636,"I do think, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, first of all, that that would require you to read the sentence, the rulemaking provision in 201(b), not in accordance with its plain meaning."
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,306.852,328.806,"Staying with 201(a) for just a minute, if the suggestion by the Chief Justice were one we thought correct, and the first sentence in (a) was a limitation on the rule... the last sentence in the rulemaking authority in (b), do you have a fall back position with, oh, we're really talking about interstate commerce anyway?"
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,328.806,329.637,--Well--
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.637,336.072,Or... or is... is... would... would your case necessarily founder if we accepted the Chief Justice's--
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,336.072,337.374,--It... my case would--
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.374,339.285,--suggestion?
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,339.285,341.538,--My case wouldn't founder at all for three reasons.
1998.97-826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.472,421.93,"Well, if you applied that argument, then 2(b) wouldn't have kept... wouldn't have kept the FCC out of intrastate phone rates, even... even before the 1996 act."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,422.839,443.162,"No, it doesn't prove too much because before the 1996 act... well, first of all, before the 1996 act, the FCC did regulate how local incumbents charge other carriers for use of their network, for example, in the cases involving exchange access or private lines or customer provided equipment."
1998.97-826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.162,445.293,But only with regard to interstate calls.
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,445.293,446.836,"No, with respect to both."
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,510.785,513.187,"Well, you mean they're parts of the act that don't have to be construed?"
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,513.187,515.821,"--Well, I don't think--"
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.821,517.811,Is that the gravamen of your argument?
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,517.811,536.034,"--I... no, I think the import of section 2(b), as this Court announced in Louisiana Public Service Commission, is that an... a provision of the Communications Act won't be understood to apply to a purely interstate matter unless it clearly does."
1998.97-826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.348,551.654,"Don't you think 2(b) has been repealed by the... it is impossible, is it not, after the 1960... 1996 act, to give effect to 2(b)?"
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,551.654,552.664,"Oh, I don't think so at all."
1998.97-826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.664,552.894,Why?
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,560.12,577.35,"Well, I think it is not possible to apply any provisions of the... or certainly the provisions that we're dealing with here, 251, 252, 253, 254, 271, as dealing inextricably with interstate and intrastate matters."
1998.97-826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.213,621.619,"But 2(b) has its exceptions written in, except as provided in sections 223 through 227, inclusive, and section 332, and subject to 301 in title 6."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,632.217,650.42,"Well, we think that it is, in fact, impossible to apply it to the local competition provisions in this case, first, because those provisions plainly do apply to interstate matters, and the FCC has statutory authority to implement them."
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,675.374,682.29,"As to your first argument, are you saying that the act has changed the boundaries between what's local and what's interstate?"
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,682.29,684.031,No.
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,684.031,684.852,The 1996--
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,684.852,685.032,No.
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.032,686.902,--I thought that you could say that--
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,686.902,687.813,"Well, what it--"
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,687.813,691.457,--that it... that it has made what was previously thought to be local now interstate.
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,694.529,708.18,"--I think, Justice Kennedy, rather than say change the definition, the definitions were already becoming quite blurred, as I've indicated, by the decisions involving private lines and private branch exchanges and exchange access."
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,708.18,709.181,Are those decisions of this Court?
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,709.181,716.687,They're all decisions of the FCC that were... that were approved on appeal without... without exception by the courts of appeals.
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.687,717.427,By courts of appeals?
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,717.427,725.902,"And some of those decisions, Mr. Chief Justice, are referred to or referenced in footnote 4 of this Court's opinion in Louisiana Public Service Commission."
1998.97-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,745.696,751.84,"So, then Justice Scalia is right, that 2(b) is just not really applicable anymore."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,751.84,766.01,"--We think that it is not applicable with respect to these provisions, and to the extent that it did apply, the exception for inseverability would nonetheless give the FCC the authority to promulgate rules about this methodology."
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.01,787.892,"But what about using 2(b) in what I think is a rather difficult statutory problem, which is to reconcile... assuming there is rulemaking authority, reconcile the word rates, you know, in 251 where it talks about unbundled access."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,811.977,812.578,Right.
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,812.758,814.81,--reconciling them by saying--
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,814.81,815.821,--There's nothing--
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,815.821,834.594,"--look at history and look at the extent to which a rate is traditionally up to the carrier for State regulation, look at it traditionally Federal regulation, and say that's what we look to, and that's what the difference between the rates in the two sections means."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,836.106,850.816,"--Because there is nothing irreconcilable about... about section 252(b), (c), and (d) and the requirement you pointed out in section 251(c)(3) that rates be just, reasonable, and in accordance with section 252."
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.217,900.477,Yes.
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,900.477,932.03,"--Now, if you were to... a reading that says that the references to what State commissions do in arbitration ousts the Federal... Federal Communications Commission with respect to any matter... any reference to or any responsibility with respect to carrier to carrier rates, you are required to... you... you encounter a half dozen or more irreconcilable interpretive anomalies elsewhere in the statute."
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.084,1015.385,Yes.
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1015.385,1016.076,--and 252.
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1016.076,1017.388,"General, methodological rules, yes."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1017.388,1017.746,Okay.
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1017.746,1022.902,But not rules that take 75 years of ratemaking and turn them on their heads--
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1022.902,1023.402,Well--
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1023.402,1032.896,"--preventing commissions, State commissions, in effect, should they so wish, to permit a local monopolist to recover his fixed costs."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1059.614,1059.914,--Justice--
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.914,1063.707,"Now, I'm trying to summarize their argument in like one sentence, but that's what I've tried to do."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1063.908,1070.183,"--Justice Breyer, what... this act does not take away the State commissions' historical ratemaking role."
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1076.285,1084.38,"That part was what I didn't get because I read through these over the summer, and I don't see how the State maintains a significant rate setting role."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1087.913,1097.02,"--The role that the State commissions have always had is to determine the maximum rates that the telephone company can charge retail and wholesale customers, and they still have that."
1998.97-826,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1123.416,1131.691,"General Waxman, may I... do I have it right, that the validity of TELRIC would be... if you prevail on the jurisdictional question, that's open."
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1131.691,1131.941,That's--
1998.97-826,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1131.941,1132.883,That hasn't been considered yet.
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1132.883,1133.173,--That's right.
1998.97-826,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1147.384,1147.564,You're right.
1998.97-826,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1151.325,1155.678,"But there are explanations of this carrier wanted this, this commenter wanted that."
1998.97-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1160.501,1161.963,"Yes, you may, General Waxman."
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1163.426,1184.919,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-826,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1268.252,1274.367,"Mr. Ennis, one of the briefs said that most of the Sate commissions on their own have adopted TELRIC."
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1274.887,1288.188,"The great majority of the State commissions on their own have adopted TELRIC or some other forward looking cost scheme rather than historical embedded costs, but not all have."
1998.97-826,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1298.632,1299.663,But how do I vote?
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1342.272,1356.512,"Justice Breyer, let me respond to that by saying, first, Congress has itself expressly in the statute taken away from the States their historic function of deciding rates based on rate of return proceedings."
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.798,1411.352,"TELRIC does, but... but if... if your interpretation of the statute is correct, you would say the FCC could prescribe those things as well."
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1411.352,1417.477,"--Justice Scalia, as far as FCC's jurisdiction is concerned, that's correct."
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.389,1438.82,"Well, why... why suddenly be worried about that at that point?"
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1441.572,1442.213,"Well, in fact--"
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.213,1445.415,That's a point of whether the FCC can adopt TELRIC at all.
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1445.415,1450.941,"--In fact, Justice Scalia, I think your point about earlier and later is a very important point, but I see it a little differently."
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.699,1501.073,"That makes good sense, but artificially limiting it the way you were a moment ago doesn't make good sense it seems to me--"
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1501.073,1501.752,Well--
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.752,1513.081,"--by saying that, well, you know, if and when the FCC goes further and doesn't even let the States make these determinations as to proper allocations and so forth, then we can worry about those."
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1520.727,1524.491,"--Well, I wouldn't want to prejudge how the Court would come out on the merits, Your Honor, but let me--"
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.491,1527.323,--Give me a good reason for... from separating the one from the other.
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1527.323,1529.527,--I think the reason is the reason I just gave.
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1529.527,1529.987,Which was?
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1532.799,1536.249,"Well, perhaps I didn't understand your question, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.374,1582.932,"I can't imagine, but why... but why... the argument you were making was that, look it, TELRIC doesn't go all the way."
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1597.169,1599.1,"Well, not as a matter of jurisdiction."
1998.97-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1599.1,1599.32,Right.
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1599.32,1607.276,"But then under Chevron deference, whether on the merits that was appropriate or not is exactly the question that this Court is going to decide in the second hour of the argument."
1998.97-826,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1608.988,1616.613,But I take it it's your position that the FCC has no... has no discretion about reserving the adjudicatory jurisdiction to the States.
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1627.611,1640.698,"--Justice Souter, I think the FCC, as a jurisdictional matter, would have the authority to set particular rates if he thought... if it thought that was necessary in order to ensure local competition, just as it has the authority under--"
1998.97-826,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1640.698,1643.81,Would it do... would it have that authority at the front end as well as at the back end?
1998.97-826,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1643.81,1644.871,"--Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1998.97-826,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.861,1763.011,"Thank you, Mr. Ennis."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1764.323,1772.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.497,1818.138,May I ask you a question about 252?
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1827.895,1829.805,That is correct.
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1829.805,1833.057,"And in doing so, it is to apply a Federal standard, is it not?"
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1835.599,1835.849,It is.
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.552,1843.096,And their... whether they've applied it correctly or incorrectly is subject to review by the Federal district court.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1843.096,1844.084,And that's correct.
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.084,1850.75,"Now, is this... does that... and this is in a procedural section, 252, whereas the requirements are in 251."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1864.31,1868.891,It's our position that the standards are in section 252.
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1878.158,1880.669,But that's not quite responsive to my question.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1893.398,1896.949,Not the FCC.
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.533,1905.995,"So, the only learning about the meaning of the Federal standard is in the statute itself without further guidance."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1905.995,1907.667,"Yes, I think the State--"
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.667,1913.01,Could the States issue regulations setting forth their interpretation of what this says?
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1913.47,1915.281,"--Yes, I believe that the States could do that."
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.281,1918.313,--But they would have to be litigated in... in Federal district court?
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1918.313,1926.851,"Now, that's an interesting question because those would be under the State's Administrative Procedures Act."
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.851,1931.323,"Well, but they'd relate to the standards set forth in the Federal statute I assume."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1931.323,1931.744,"Yes, that's correct."
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.744,1934.235,I assume those would be Federal questions.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1934.235,1934.695,Yes.
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.695,1939.347,And you could have 50 different States having 50 different sets of regulations.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1939.347,1940.789,"Yes, you could, Your Honor."
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.789,1944.021,"Until they were all litigated out eventually, you know."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1944.021,1949.755,And many different decisions under the Federal standards that are in section 252.
1998.97-826,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1958.501,1969.658,"So, the State regulatory authorities would be given, in effect, Chevron deference, a standard similar to Chevron in the Federal system?"
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,1969.658,1982.556,"I don't think with respect... you know, what the Federal courts are to look at when they look at those arbitration decisions is to see whether or not they're in compliance with the statute, and with respect to questions of law, there would be no deference."
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.556,1988.3,"Well, but we usually give the agency committed with initial interpretation of the statute deference."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2017.161,2023.953,"I think that's a question that's being litigated in the courts right now, as those arbitrations go through the Federal district courts."
1998.97-826,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2023.953,2029.848,But then that would seem to make illusory the congressional scheme to have Federal review.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2038.325,2041.918,"Well, I don't... I don't think that... that that's necessarily right."
1998.97-826,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2051.795,2059.447,"Ms. Munns, if it's a Federal statute, then who is taking care to see that the Federal law is faithfully executed?"
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2098.796,2102.137,"--And I'm not aware of any scheme like this, but--"
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2102.137,2106.97,There might be a scheme if you didn't take the position that the States could issue regulations.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2122.702,2124.703,--Yes.
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.883,2128.687,"You could do that, but you couldn't have any regulations coming out of the States then."
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.687,2136.203,"But here, as I understand it, the 252 gives the State agencies jurisdiction just in an adjudicatory way."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2143.857,2147.509,"--They are adjudicators, but the standards are also in section 252."
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.044,2154.542,Follow the Federal standard.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2154.542,2158.716,"--for section 251, and it makes no reference to Federal standards."
1998.97-826,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2158.716,2170.343,"Well, what do you think of 252(c)(1), which General Waxman alluded to, which binds the adjudicators in those circumstances to applying the regs issued under 251?"
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2198.634,2219.817,"Section 252(c) that you're referring to says that when the State is making a decision in an arbitration, it must look to make sure that the decision is in compliance with section 251, including the FCC's regulations under 252 and the standards under section 252(d)."
1998.97-826,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2226.913,2242.264,"Well, but maybe I'm missing... I know I'm missing the point because I thought the reference back to 251 and regs issued under 251 was a reference, in effect, to the rulemaking authority under 251(d)."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2264.236,2269.972,"Well, section 251(d) is not a grant of authority to the FCC."
1998.97-826,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2305.004,2310.698,"So, basically your answer is that 251(d) refers solely to timing."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2325.108,2331.962,And... and it's our position that the FCC does have authority with respect when... 251(d) says--
1998.97-826,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2331.962,2335.223,But they include regulations dealing with rates.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2335.223,2351.885,"--I think that when... when Congress in 252 said that the State commissions shall establish for... shall set rates for the purposes of section 251, that it became clear that the State commissions were to do that."
1998.97-826,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2380.445,2384.476,But Louisiana was before the 1996 act.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2417.979,2421.681,"You know, Your Honor, these are still dual use facilities."
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2467.573,2468.224,Where does it say that?
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2468.224,2469.195,In section--
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.195,2471.145,It doesn't say any unless it's explicit.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2471.145,2472.445,--Louisiana.
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.445,2473.777,Are you quoting 2(b)?
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2473.777,2475.838,"This Court in... no, I'm quoting this Court in Louisiana."
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.838,2476.128,I see.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2476.128,2479.681,That's an interpretation of 2(b) from Louisiana.
1998.97-826,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.681,2481.111,2(b) doesn't really mean what it says.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2489.886,2502.705,"That... that was what this Court has said in Louisiana, that there has to be two parts: first, that the statute has to apply; but secondly, that Congress has to make an assignment of an intrastate duty to the FCC."
1998.97-826,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2524.5,2531.453,"Well, as I interpret the Solicitor General's argument, at least from the brief, there's... one line is between interstate and intrastate."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2549.526,2551.759,Their argument is that--
1998.97-826,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.759,2555.058,"And we... and Louisiana did not address that point, did it?"
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2555.058,2563.125,"--No, but Louisiana said that 2(b) acts as both a rule of construction and a congressional denial of power to the FCC."
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.964,2630.729,"But you do agree, Ms. Munns, do you not, that insofar as 2(b) refers to what... how far the act shall apply, that it's been repealed?"
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2630.729,2640.175,We concede that the 1996 act covers intrastate matters--
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.175,2645.489,"And therefore, that that portion of 2(b) is no longer have any meaning in this case."
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2645.489,2650.301,"--No, that the statute must both apply and the FCC must--"
1998.97-826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.301,2650.531,No.
1998.97-826,2,21298,diane_munns,,2659.006,2659.467,--No.
1998.97-826,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.488,2663.239,"Thank you, Ms. Munns."
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2665.041,2685.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-826,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.098,2722.589,Great... great precision?
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2722.589,2723.53,"--Well, it took me a while--"
1998.97-826,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.72,2728.201,You can describe this piece of legislation as great precision?
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2728.421,2732.245,"Not... not, Justice Scalia, as great elegance."
1998.97-826,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.583,2795.176,"Mr. Tribe, is it not significant that they are given that statutory duty in the context of resolving arbitrations?"
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2798.848,2801.491,"Justice Stevens, with all respect, I do not agree with that."
1998.97-826,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.491,2807.087,"Now, what in the statute... what in the statute gives them rulemaking authority with regard to pricing?"
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2807.087,2831.09,"Well, in section 261(b) and 261(c), it's quite clear that rulemaking authority is contemplated, and indeed the preemptive structure established there shows that we're talking about State regulations."
1998.97-826,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.098,2854.796,That's the key point.
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2857.611,2857.828,"--Well, with the provisions."
1998.97-826,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2924.715,2927.057,And is consistent with the requirements of this section.
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2927.057,2936.862,"--Of this section, but no reference to regulations of the FCC, and nothing in the section precludes the commissions from carrying out the duty."
1998.97-826,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2937.523,2938.604,What about (d)(1)?
1998.97-826,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2938.604,2943.326,"Let me ask... let me ask one question just to summarize it, Mr. Tribe, because I want to be sure I understand your position."
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2960.86,2973.55,--The State commissions have rulemaking authority contemplated by this act to implement it including doing what they are told they must do in 252(d)(1).
1998.97-826,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.55,2979.143,And are they then promulgating in your view Federal standards or State standards?
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2979.143,2984.668,I think they are promulgating State standards to implement a general Federal principle.
1998.97-826,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.312,3008.652,We don't need Chevron deference.
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3008.652,3009.834,"I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-826,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3035.669,3036.009,Somewhat different?
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3038.982,3047.738,"--I don't think that's yet clear, Justice Ginsburg, because so far, as you know, most of them, as you pointed out, are using TELRIC or something very close to it."
1998.97-826,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3047.738,3050.269,"Well, if there's a limit... I mean, only the word cost."
1998.97-826,3,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3050.269,3051.23,"That's right, and the limit--"
1998.97-826,4,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3556.062,3580.285,"Every question that has been raised in this oral argument can be answered with reference to section 251(c)(3) which requires... that deals with unbundled network elements and requires that they provided... be provided at rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and... and consistent with the standards of section 252."
1998.97-826,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3585.41,3585.751,Thank you.

1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,3868.397,3869.146,Well--
1998.97-826,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3869.146,3870.368,Where else could they go?
1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,3870.368,3877.273,"--That... that's the inquiry that should have been made, and in fact, in many markets there are many facilities."
1998.97-826,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4009.731,4011.571,"Mr. Barr, can I just ask for help?"
1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,4013.752,4014.193,--Yes.
1998.97-826,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4014.193,4015.875,Where in the papers is that?

1998.97-826,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4017.555,4019.255,Is it in the petitioners' appendix?
1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,4021.358,4023.87,It's in the joint appendix at page 49.

1998.97-826,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4073.234,4077.327,"Mr. Barr, what again is what you say is the error that they have not appealed?"
1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,4077.327,4093.066,"--Their premise was that the language technical feasibility, the point of technical feasibility meant not just the point at which you grant access to an element, but that you have to give access to every element that's technically feasible to give access to."
1998.97-826,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4099.12,4103.033,Point of technical feasibility where in the statute?

1998.97-826,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4109.488,4109.728,Right.
1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,4109.728,4114.693,--says you get access to unbundled elements at any technically feasible point.
1998.97-826,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4126.501,4126.912,That's what 278 says.
1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,4126.912,4127.46,"No, no."
1998.97-826,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4142.011,4142.238,Right.
1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,4142.238,4147.254,"Then seven paragraphs later, when they come across the need standard, they say, gee, that's funny."
1998.97-826,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4245.17,4255.657,"Before you go away from the need and impair, what would be a fair way of implementing that statutory provision?"
1998.97-826,5,44087,william_p_barr,,4255.657,4280.943,"--What the FCC should have done was to engage in the fundamental task here, which is to differentiate what are the advantages and the things about the incumbent's business that can be fairly competed against, that can be counteracted by an effective competitor, and what are the things in their business that even an effective competitor could not reasonably counteract in a short period of time because of the legacy of monopoly."
1998.97-826,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4283.036,4294.212,"Is it right... I'm thinking in my mind that... for example, a local loop, which means wires that go under the street to my house, spread out throughout a city, would be something that would be quite difficult for a new competitor to do."

1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5135.026,5139.43,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5335.069,5337.142,I rather missed the reason.

I understand the question to be why isn't there fear that new incumbents will use the opportunity to lease all elements to, in effect, make an end run around the resale option that the statute permits under (c)(4) which is priced as a discount to retail rates."
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5467.166,5472.388,"If you can answer that, you will go a long way towards answering the question."
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5472.388,5479.304,"--I will... okay, I will take a try, and to the extent to which there is some part of your question I haven't answered, please give me the chance."
1998.97-826,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5557.696,5558.154,Excuse me.
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5565.38,5568.702,"--Well, that... that is the problem for--"
1998.97-826,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5568.702,5571.865,Do you think that's what... do you think that's what Congress meant by... by competition?
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5575.367,5575.607,--No.
1998.97-826,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5600.475,5600.645,The producers--
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5600.645,5601.744,--are just getting a discount.
1998.97-826,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5601.744,5602.285,"--Right, exactly."
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5602.285,5616.033,"Now, with respect to the empirical findings that the Commission made... and recall, Justice Breyer, that these were findings that had to be made within 6 months by mandate in a period in which there is no competition."
1998.97-826,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5863.857,5864.928,Get a new customer.
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5864.928,5865.867,"--Well, exactly right."
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5867.119,5898.719,"It seems virtually inconceivable intuitively that somebody goes and says... the loop costs like $30 a month or something and... or $12 a month and the chance that the customer who has it attached to her house is not going to pay the $12 a month or $14 or something like that... I mean, it's conceivable I grant you, but when looking through those three paragraphs, if that's what the FCC is driving at, I think they'd have to use some example that's a little better than just announcing that there is some risk that the loop won't be paid for."
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5898.719,5900.432,"Well, let me make two points, Justice Breyer."
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5910.998,5911.879,I quite sympathize with the FCC on this.
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5912.42,5922.274,"The FCC has said at many times during this order there's no competition now and we don't have a crystal ball about the way it's going to compete, but we have to make a predictive judgment."
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5932.332,5956.217,"But the reason that it's so serious I think is because of what they say in their brief, that... that given the present structure of rates and given the fact that universal system subsidies have not yet come into effect, to follow this particular system, at least they say, runs the risk that people will, where in fact fixed costs have been shoved into business rates, go and buy this wholesale TELRIC thing which will give them rates that are well below."
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5956.217,5956.918,--Absolutely.
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5956.918,5965.323,"On the other hand, where you're talking about residential consumers, what they'll do is they there will appeal to the resale wholesale business for a totally different reason."
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5975.54,5975.84,Okay.
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5975.84,5983.717,"And because I didn't see an answer, I began to think, well, maybe they're right in saying this just goes too far, this interpretation."
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5983.717,5987.256,Let me give you an answer that looks to the two paradigms you've just addressed.
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5997.083,5997.283,No.
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,5999.274,5999.544,--Okay.
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6000.285,6009.903,"--I'm really thinking of residential customers who weren't getting subsidies in a straight sense, but in fact they were not bearing a proportionate share of the fixed costs."
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,6009.903,6010.194,--Okay.
1998.97-826,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6011.482,6012.704,Maybe that comes to the same thing.
1998.97-826,6,42213,seth_p_waxman,,6012.704,6025.013,"--Well, I... let me just say that any time, if there is a subsidized customer under the old system, that a new incumbent takes over on the basis of resale, the local incumbent isn't hurt at all."
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6295.513,6306.43,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-826,7,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,6363.467,6366.418,What about Mr. Barr's point that there are other sources?
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6366.418,6366.959,--Pardon me?
1998.97-826,7,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,6366.959,6376.865,"That Mr. Barr said... I asked, suppose someone has no facilities, how do they get into this, apart from using the incumbent's facilities?"
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6385.981,6387.704,Just let's put this in context.
1998.97-826,7,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,6442.449,6444.412,--People won't request things they don't need.
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6451.304,6462.082,--The FCC considered the consequences of the rule that Mr. Barr is urging and it found it would serve no positive purpose because people won't request things that they don't need.
1998.97-826,7,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6465.683,6465.864,But if--
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6465.864,6467.105,--impose added costs.
1998.97-826,7,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6467.105,6472.558,"--If Congress provided that need is the standard, the FCC has got to defer to that."
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6474.411,6474.659,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1998.97-826,7,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6494.884,6501.316,"What he's complaining about is the... is the transition from need to want, which is a statutory question."
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6501.316,6502.808,--It's a statutory question.
1998.97-826,7,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,6530.226,6535.509,But doesn't he have a textual basis for his claim to individualized determinations?
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6548.539,6549.12,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-826,7,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,6566.721,6567.162,So you say.
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6567.162,6567.753,--And--
1998.97-826,7,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,6567.753,6573.136,"But it sounds like an individualized determination is contemplated, and I think that's what he's asking."
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6573.136,6579.38,"--Well, if... I would submit that the FCC doesn't make anything available."
1998.97-826,7,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,6585.823,6590.166,But he wants that determination to be individualized where it is made.
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6590.166,6606.505,"That's right, and the FCC determined that... that it would defeat the objectives of the act and would impose added costs on people for no reason if that individualized determination were required to be made in each separate arbitration proceeding."
1998.97-826,7,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,6625.52,6651.376,"Just before you do that, would you... would you explain to me if Congress really meant these two to be available kind of at the entrant's option, why was there conditioning of the long distance carrier on the... getting into the resale business but not on the networks element, if Congress thought you could get everything by the networks element route?"
1998.97-826,7,20717,david_w_carpenter,,6651.376,6653.629,"--Yes, and that relates to my second point."
1998.97-826,7,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6884.68,6885.77,"Thank you, Mr. Carpenter."
1998.97-826,8,44087,william_p_barr,,6888.614,6893.887,There's a pivotal word in section 251(c)(3).
1998.97-826,8,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6979.022,6982.415,But suppose they only had 6 months in the statute.
1998.97-826,8,44087,william_p_barr,,6989.04,6989.538,We say--
1998.97-826,8,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,6989.538,6990.138,--if necessary.
1998.97-826,8,44087,william_p_barr,,6990.138,6996.133,"--if you... if you... if you have to rely on everything that the incumbent has, that's why resale is there."
1998.97-826,8,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,7065.529,7068.451,What about the right mind point that Mr. Carpenter made?
1998.97-826,8,44087,william_p_barr,,7074.054,7092.728,"I... I... I would like someone to tell that to the Chairman of AT&T because they have been standing around with their hands in their pockets for 3 years talking about a UNE platform, that their entry strategy was to buy a UNE platform, which means our network, nothing different, totally our network under the fiction that they're buying pieces."
1998.97-826,8,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7135.096,7136.138,"Thank you, Mr. Barr."
