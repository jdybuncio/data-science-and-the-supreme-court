1976.76-439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,49.309,"We will hear arguments next in 76-439, Territory of Guam against Olsen."
1976.76-439,0,20242,charles_h_troutman,,51.333,54.12,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,1901.193,1906.47,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.76-439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.921,2007.233,"Mr. Trapp, let me just modify the question a little bit, then supposing that the question is whether the Organic Act would prevent the Guam Legislature from enacting two statutes."
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,2028.934,2046.866,"Well, in the first place, I think we have at least raising -- it has had a possible constitutional question as to whether or not Congress -- well, we have the first impression whether Congress intended to do appeals to an Article III Court eventually on federal questions and --"
1976.76-439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.866,2058.005,"Well, is there anything in the language of the Organic Act that would prevent the Guam Legislature from withdrawing entirely the appellate jurisdiction of the existing District Court."
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,2058.005,2084.629,"I do not think that there is anything in the language of the Organic Act which prevents that but I think we are not -- the Government seems to take some comfort from the fact that there is no such language but I think that they are not talking about the real world, they are not talking about the world that the Congress expect it would obtain in Guam and that is the say that real world invariably appeals, and a certain number of instances are always allowed by Legislature."
1976.76-439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.629,2095.762,"As Judge Kennedy had read the word ?determine? as I understand his opinion to mean that there is at least some category of patty matters, smaller matters as to which there need be no appeal."
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,2095.762,2100.774,"Of course and the language in the Organic Act does not say, shall provide appeals in all cases."
1976.76-439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.418,2118.475,You would say that means they can determine that there will be minor matters as to which should be no appeal but they could not determine that there will be no appeals at all.
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,2118.475,2128.567,I am not saying that the language does not say that there cannot be no appeals at all; I am simply saying I cannot believe that Congress ever anticipated that situation ever happening.
1976.76-439,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.567,2136.766,"Certainly your construction does not fall in what would call the plain meaning of the language that Justice Stevens is asking about, is it?"
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,2136.766,2142.116,As to the Congress not contemplating never doing away with all appeals?
1976.76-439,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.116,2171.386,"No, I mean as to the part of Section 22 (a) on Page 2 of the petitioner?s briefs which describes the original jurisdiction and says the jurisdiction up of the District Court, and then says jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction which has been transferred by the Legislature to other courts or courts established by it, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as the Legislature may it determine."
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,2178.262,2182.937,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, are you asking me why couldn?t they simply do or not ever provide for appeals?"
1976.76-439,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.937,2192.439,Why not read the statute literally and if one does read it literally it sounds to me to give virtually unlimited authority to the Guam Legislature in this particular matter.
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,2192.439,2194.476,"Oh, I must respectfully disagree."
1976.76-439,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.15,2293.448,Even though the Guam Legislature determines that the District Court shall not have appellate jurisdiction.
1976.76-439,1,28221,howard_trapp,,2293.448,2309.333,"Yes, but I do not think, I cannot believe that the Congress ever dreamt the Guam Legislature would simply say, well we are going to create courts of original jurisdiction but we will never have appeals from any of the more important types of cases."
1976.76-439,2,44695,walter_s_ferenz,,3129.172,3134.8,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
