1991.90-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.877,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-1279, Myra Jo Collins v. the City of Harker Heights, Texas."
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,10.949,14.111,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.084,117.158,"And what is the violation of the Constitution claim, Mr. Rosen?"
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,117.158,123.352,"The taking of his life in essence, Your Honor, in disregard of his bodily security."
1991.90-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,123.352,128.175,That is protected by what provision of the Constitution?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,128.175,134.709,"The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which specifically states that life shall not be taken without due process of law."
1991.90-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.709,141.693,"If they had given him some sort of a hearing before they sent him into this place, would that have solved the due process problem?"
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,141.693,150.758,"The only hearing that would have solved the due process problem would have been training, warning, and supervision, not a hearing, shall you go down in and succumb."
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,161.938,165.388,"xxx case in this Court, in your support?"
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,165.388,174.184,In terms of his life having been lost?
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.184,175.646,The closest--
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,175.646,189.654,"The closest, excuse me, would be Harris and City of Canton, even though it involved not a public employee, of course, but it did involve the deliberate indifference of a municipality."
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.654,190.926,--And a failure to train?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,190.926,192.375,And a failure to train.
1991.90-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.241,203.775,That was where the woman was in the custody of the policy and slumped down?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,203.775,204.734,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.734,206.885,But there she was in custody.
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,224.496,247.113,"That is why, Your Honor, in all of the briefing we have taken the position that not only do you have to prove your section 1983 claim against the municipality by meeting the standard of deliberate indifference, but in order to establish the violation of the due process right itself, you have to meet a standard of deliberate indifference."
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.632,285.868,Is there a case in this Court dealing with police using undue force in making an arrest?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,285.868,288.811,There have been a number of such cases.
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.811,289.272,Yes.
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,294.444,300.058,Not to my recollection.
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.058,314.246,I suppose you would say that the deliberate indifference standard involving failure to train would apply in a situation like that?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,337.311,344.107,That raises an interesting point that goes in a way to the heart of the duality that's here.
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.196,361.126,Training case--
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,361.126,362.438,--a due process proposition.
1991.90-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.293,399.041,"--The deliberate indifference you are talking about here basically comes from Monell's requirement that it be a policy of the municipality rather than an act of the individual, doesn't it?"
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,399.041,416.164,"That is correct, and that gets to... past the section 1983 initial pleading obligation, which as this Court has repeatedly said, involves only two elements: that a Federal right has been invaded under the color of State law."
1991.90-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,464.023,474.2,"Then you are really borrowing from the Monell line of cases a concept that had nothing to do with the Constitution and importing it into constitutional law, aren't you?"
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,474.2,480.405,"I think not, Your Honor, because I can borrow that from the Estelle line of cases under the Eighth Amendment."
1991.90-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.405,482.926,But you are not claiming an Eighth Amendment violation.
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,482.926,483.747,"No, we are not."
1991.90-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.662,510.665,How does your case differ from DeShaney v. Winnebago County?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,510.665,518.049,The way that differs is we analyzed DeShaney as essentially a State action causation case.
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.232,547.219,"Well, the Fifth Circuit seemed to say that there be... there could have been liability if there had been an abuse of governmental power."
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,547.219,552.01,And I know not where they get that as an element of a section 1983 claim.
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.01,561.557,Has it ever... has that... has that concept been given some content in the Fifth Circuit?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,561.557,564.198,"Yes, the content is--"
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.198,569.824,What would have been... what would have been an abuse of governmental power in a case like this?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,571.435,588.176,"--As I read the Fifth Circuit law, which involves four... five cases in which they have used that phrase, I don't think it is possible to make that assertion within the context of an employment relationship for an injury that occurs on the job."
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.176,592.098,"Well, having employees is an exercise of governmental power I suppose, isn't it?"
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,592.098,593.697,"We believe so, Your Honor."
1991.90-1279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.697,604.596,And... did you argue to them that it is an abuse of governmental power if you don't train your employees properly?
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,604.596,634.954,"We argued, by the time we got to the Fifth Circuit, as its opinion reflects, that the analysis presented by the Eighth Circuit in the Ruge decision is the correct analysis, which tracks just what Your Honor said, that it's not the employment and the injury in employment, but by putting somebody untrained in a position of high risk known to the municipality and so far as these pleadings are concerned, we may infer, not known to decedent, that is the violation of constitutional right."
1991.90-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.927,664.176,"Counsel, do you know... section 1983 aside, do you know of any case involving the due process clause and involving substantive due process, deprivation of life, liberty, or property, where the deprivation was not intentional, where the State through negligence or gross negligence or whatever you like has caused somebody's death and it's been held to be a violation of the due process clause?"
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,664.176,676.251,"I would think, if you are speaking of the State as opposed to an individual flesh-and-blood State actor, I know of no such case, so far as--"
1991.90-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.251,686.54,"You think the test for a constitutional violation under 1983 is different from the test under the due process clause, simpliciter, as we say?"
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,686.54,688.65,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.728,723.503,"Yes, but as the Chief Justice pointed out, that's the standard for attributing... for attributing the violation to the municipality, but in all of the cases I am aware of anyway, the violation, at least when you are talking about a due process, substantive due process violation, is an intentional violation on the part of somebody, not that the person died or was deprived of something accidentally or even with gross negligence."
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,732.469,740.756,"What we... our position is that the city's failure to train is the intentional action, just as in LaFleur the--"
1991.90-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.756,744.146,"I don't mean any intentional action, I mean, the deprivation has to be intentional."
1991.90-1279,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,750.612,752.992,--But intent has two components.
1991.90-1279,1,34972,lucas_a_powe_jr,,1633.662,1638.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1279,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,3353.014,3353.916,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.075,3405.819,Are those cases in conflict with the Fifth Circuit?
1991.90-1279,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,3405.819,3406.921,I believe so.
1991.90-1279,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3408.501,3413.385,So the Fifth Circuit's put itself in conflict with almost... with every other court of appeals?
1991.90-1279,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,3413.385,3415.986,--I believe so on this abuse of power concept.
1991.90-1279,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3452.991,3455.223,"Thank you, Mr. Rosen."
