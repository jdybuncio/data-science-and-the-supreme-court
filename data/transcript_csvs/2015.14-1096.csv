2015.14-1096,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.669,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 14-1096, Torres v. Lynch. Mr. Guadagno."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,7.669,11.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress made a choice."
2015.14-1096,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.0,123.92,But your reading leaves out some very serious arson offenses.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,139.115,165.72,"But -- but -- but on -- on our reading, while -- while it wouldn't fall under the -- the -- the (e) provision in the aggravated felony statute, these more serious arson offenses, the -- the State and foreign offenses, they -- they would fall under the -- the (f), crime of violence, provision where -- where there is a sentence to a year or more. And -- and under -- under that -- that approach, these less-serious arsons would -- would not be aggravated felons."
2015.14-1096,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,173.74,177.485,Do you think that's still clear after our decision in Johnson?
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,177.485,184.35,"Johnson, if I -- if I remember correctly, dealt -- dealt with -- with -- with 16 -- 16(b)."
2015.14-1096,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,191.54,207.83,"But what you're relying is -- you're relying on language that is similar to, maybe, and -- and maybe different in an -- in an important respect; but nevertheless bears some similarity to the residual clause in the -- in the armed criminal -- Armed Career Criminal Act, does it not?"
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,207.83,208.84,Yes.
2015.14-1096,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,240.765,248.48,May I ask you about the statutory language that seems to me to present the greatest problem for your position.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,290.755,296.37,The -- the language you're -- you're referring to is -- is referred to normally as the penultimate sentence.
2015.14-1096,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,325.8,326.15,Right.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,352.139,359.79,"This -- this -- this language, it -- it -- it doesn't -- it doesn't directly address jurisdiction."
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,368.01,375.19,"There -- this -- this provision applies to an entire list of multiple crimes, right?"
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,375.19,376.245,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,376.245,380.72,And so for most of those crimes there is no jurisdictional element at all.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,380.72,382.08,"That -- that is also correct, yes."
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,382.08,391.67,"So if you're looking at this as superfluous to not this individual subprovision, one subprovision of many --"
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,391.67,392.345,Yes.
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,392.345,394.56,-- it's doing a lot of work.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,394.56,395.345,Yeah.
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,395.345,401.29,"It's doing a lot of work because there are a lot of other crimes that qualify under State law, correct?"
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,401.29,402.18,"That's correct, yeah."
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,402.18,408.925,"I mean, your brief and the Solicitor General's sort of tunnel in on this one provision of many."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,419.57,420.0,Yes.
2015.14-1096,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,440.49,441.87,But suppose --
2015.14-1096,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,441.87,443.27,What your --
2015.14-1096,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,443.27,443.69,Go ahead.
2015.14-1096,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,443.69,452.96,What your theory does is at least create a world in which some things are included and some things are excluded in a way that appears not to make much sense.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,506.61,526.085,"Well, the -- the -- the same way that -- that -- that there's -- there's an aggravated felony provision for arson in the generics for all those things that Your Honor mentioned, that there are other categories of aggravated felony which would cover State offenses for those things: Sexual abuse of a minor, crime of violence."
2015.14-1096,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,540.31,553.2,"Take two -- two defendants. One is convicted of the Federal offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, where you have to prove a connection between the firearm and interstate commerce."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,565.61,573.6,The person -- the State individual would still be removable under the firearm's removability ground.
2015.14-1096,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,573.6,576.59,"Well, but that may be discretionary as mandatory."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,592.265,601.83,"Well, you know, the interstate-commerce provision, it's -- it's an element of -- of the statute that -- that's required for a conviction."
2015.14-1096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.83,621.115,"But does it have to be expressed in the statute? Is it not always a required element of a Federal crime? There has to be Federal jurisdiction, so as -- as a matter of fact, every Federal crime has some jurisdictional element in it. Right?"
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,621.115,622.33,"Yes, but --"
2015.14-1096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.33,629.545,"Whether it's expressed in the -- in the text of the statute or not, the statute's invalid if there's no Federal hook."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,629.545,633.94,But at the same time in -- in Federal criminal law --
2015.14-1096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.94,643.495,"But -- but you're -- you're not -- you're just limiting it to the jurisdictional element recited in the statute, right? That seems to me a little illogical."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,643.495,651.5,But in this -- this Court always requires the jurisdictional element for -- for the conviction.
2015.14-1096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.99,670.48,"No, but -- but it doesn't have to be recited in the statute."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,695.84,696.98,Yes.
2015.14-1096,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.345,706.7,But -- but -- but you're not arguing that.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,712.01,717.075,I'm -- I'm not following the distinction that you're making.
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,717.075,729.2,"On those other -- the ones that are not stated in the statute, it's presumed. It doesn't have to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, correct?"
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,729.2,729.78,Okay.
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,730.7,733.79,"Can I have -- I'm going to sound like my colleague, Justice Breyer."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,733.79,734.345,Okay.
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,734.345,739.63,I became interested in the argument of the National Association of Criminal Lawyers.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,772.455,796.29,"We're -- we're not disavowing it, and I think that that does show -- support our -- our position in -- in that it shows how easy it is when -- when you have broad language that says eliminate -- eliminate elements as -- as the government says, that it could be any -- it could be any element that gets eliminated."
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,800.38,802.045,I'm not -- I'm not even on your point.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,802.045,802.645,Okay.
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,802.645,803.22,All right.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,805.26,807.63,I -- I am -- I am familiar with --
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,807.63,808.065,All right.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,809.99,810.38,Okay.
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,810.38,826.545,"They're just saying that this -- this is not covered by -- the fire, the arson is not covered by the statute at all by the enhancement -- by the statute at all, except under the arson provision that requires a sentence for a year."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,828.11,828.32,That is.
2015.14-1096,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.32,833.825,Forget about interstate or anything else. So tell me why you didn't make that argument.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,833.825,837.85,We -- we didn't make that argument because we didn't think about it.
2015.14-1096,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,891.44,900.57,The sole purpose -- the sole purpose of it is to enable Federal authority to be brought to bear on the problem.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,928.14,943.35,"On Page 24 of our brief, we cite three provisions from Title 18, two from 18 U.S.C. Section 3142, and the third one is 18 U.S.C. Section 5032."
2015.14-1096,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,963.07,966.04,"And I agree -- yes, I agree with you, that's clearer."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,976.775,1006.705,"But the important point about -- about those three Federal statutes is -- is that Congress is saying that if they want jurisdictional elements to be ignored, they're going to say so, and they're going to say so with clear language, much clearer language than -- than -- than the penultimate sentence or described in, and Congress didn't -- didn't do that here. I mean, basically we're -- we're asking to apply the full language of -- of -- of the statute, and the government is saying omit things."
2015.14-1096,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1010.66,1021.34,"No, but your assumption is that there -- an element is an element is an element, whether it's substantive or jurisdictional. And that's not the way our -- our cases have treated them, or -- or the general."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1037.0,1044.74,"But -- but still, the jurisdictional element is required for the conviction. You -- you cannot have the -- the conviction."
2015.14-1096,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1044.74,1045.14,"Oh, I know."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1078.655,1079.835,Okay.
2015.14-1096,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.43,1115.335,"No, but they wanted to make arsons offenses, whether in violation of Federal or State law."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1115.335,1120.35,But -- but it's -- it's -- it's described in this paragraph.
2015.14-1096,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1172.125,1178.23,"Well, we've -- we've not addressed this question in the context of the categorical -- application of the categorical approach."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1178.23,1205.14,"I -- I -- I don't dispute it. It -- it's never come up and -- and sort of my point. But -- but -- but still, in light of the fact that -- that Congress is -- is aware that -- that this Court utilizes the -- the -- the categorical approach, Congress would have used strong language or clearer language if -- if -- if there was going to be a modification of the categorical -- I mean, this would be a -- a major deviation from the way that the categorical approach is applied."
2015.14-1096,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1205.34,1209.16,"Mr. Guadagno, this is along the same lines as the Chief Justice's question."
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1242.07,1244.98,This is the -- what Congress showed.
2015.14-1096,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1254.85,1262.495,But -- but that -- the mens rea example is also an example where we're basically stating what we think Congress meant.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1277.675,1286.12,"Well, even -- even if it's different, okay, even if you're going to say jurisdiction is different, it -- it doesn't stop it from being a requirement."
2015.14-1096,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.099,1334.02,"You could, perhaps, treat it as we treated the $10,000 -- million in the --"
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1334.02,1335.82,-- in the Nijhawan case.
2015.14-1096,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.82,1336.37,Right.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1363.43,1364.05,Yes.
2015.14-1096,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.05,1366.27,The reason really is pretty similar here.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1394.67,1397.5,"I think -- the Nijhawan, I think, is -- is a very different situation."
2015.14-1096,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1424.675,1426.335,The penultimate sentence of what?
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1426.335,1430.16,The penultimate sentence of -- of -- of 1101(a)(43)
2015.14-1096,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.255,1445.6,I just need to read it.
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1445.6,1445.82,Okay.
2015.14-1096,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1445.82,1448.95,It's 1101(43) --
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1448.95,1450.425,-- (a) -- (a)(43)
2015.14-1096,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.145,1457.585,Thanks.
2015.14-1096,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1457.585,1466.985,What about the -- the respect that we owe to the BIA for their interpretation?
2015.14-1096,0,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,1466.985,1478.06,The -- the Board should not be owed any -- any -- any deference under -- under two different theories. One is that the criminal lenity rule should apply.
2015.14-1096,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.855,1544.975,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Goldenberg."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1544.975,1556.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1101(a)(43) indicates that violations of State and foreign law should be considered aggravated felonies along with violations of Federal law."
2015.14-1096,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1566.95,1596.82,"All these examples you gave me in your brief, either it's clear explicitly that jurisdiction was excluded by the statute or the nature of the offense gives jurisdiction or the Assimilated Crimes Act, it makes sense, because the whole purpose is that it's -- that Federal -- that a State law is going to apply when there isn't a Federal law."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1600.965,1601.97,Our point --
2015.14-1096,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1601.97,1608.685,"But -- so I don't take much from your arguments, which is the fact that it drops away in other sections."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1610.89,1615.02,"Well, our point isn't that each one of those is exactly analogous."
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1624.48,1627.285,But I -- I thought -- I agreed with that when I came in.
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1751.59,1754.32,I didn't think of it until I heard his first argument.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1754.32,1770.12,"I disagree with, I think, both halves of that. And let me start by talking about why I think it remains true, despite the crime of violence provision and other parts of the aggravated felony provision, that Petitioner's approach is radically underinclusive. First of all, it's important that we're not just talking about arson here."
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1781.28,1785.24,"I have the list in front of me, thanks to my law clerk."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1793.61,1795.0,"Well, there are a couple of different examples."
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.79,1879.03,I don't -- I don't understand.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1884.39,1885.12,No.
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.22,1895.88,"I mean, you know, if Congress wanted to cover all those things, it could have used the language it used elsewhere, which says, you know, except -- except for the jurisdictional element. But it -- it didn't say that."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1895.88,1895.94,It --
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.94,1903.22,What -- what do you do about the Federal statute that -- that -- that makes arson of a Federal building a crime?
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1903.22,1904.32,"Well, in that case --"
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.32,1912.65,"Does -- does that mean that all state arson statutes are picked up, whether it's of a Federal building or of -- of the corner grocery store?"
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1912.65,1912.97,No.
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.66,1924.095,That's -- that's the key you -- you --
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1924.095,1942.02,"Well, I think the key is if -- if the Board were going to undertake that analysis, which it hasn't done with respect to anything besides interstate-commerce jurisdictional elements, which are classic jurisdictional elements. But if the Board were going to undertake that analysis, I think it would look to the model penal code definition that the Chief Justice pointed to earlier."
2015.14-1096,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1972.54,1973.0,Why -- why is that?
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1973.0,1974.845,-- is a term of art.
2015.14-1096,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1974.845,1978.05,Isn't -- go ahead.
2015.14-1096,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1978.05,1979.585,Justice Alito.
2015.14-1096,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1979.585,1981.19,Thank you. Following up on that.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1985.735,1986.36,The Court's --
2015.14-1096,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1986.36,2007.065,"Didn't the Court's -- didn't the Court's decision in Jones interpret the reference to interstate commerce to be something more than just a jurisdictional hook, but rather a substantive requirement that limited the scope of this particular statute to more severe instances of -- of examples of the crime?"
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2007.065,2013.32,"I don't think so, because the analysis in Jones was against the backdrop of constitutional-avoidance principle."
2015.14-1096,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2028.14,2036.26,"Well, I -- I don't know why you say that, if it has to have substantive work, otherwise it wouldn't be in the statute."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2036.26,2036.7,Well --
2015.14-1096,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2036.7,2048.025,"It -- it is picking a crime that only Congress would prosecute, which is following up on Justice Alito's point, substantive because it's more serious."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2063.615,2064.5,I don't think so.
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.04,2106.19,"Why -- why have to subject the Federal courts to -- to this -- this new distinction between a jurisdictional element that's substantive and one that isn't substantive, just jurisdictional? Why -- why should I do that? I mean, if it's an element, it's an element."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2118.045,2118.43,I think --
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.43,2122.57,"And if it doesn't say that, you know, don't bother me."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2126.045,2127.22,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2015.14-1096,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2165.73,2195.135,"Is that really, Ms. Goldenberg, the only textual basis for your position? You know, your brief says a good deal about the difference between ""described"" and ""defined,"" which the Petitioner has suggested is -- is -- is not a very good distinction, because the ""defined"" only refers to actual statutory definitions. So are you still relying on that? Are you relying on anything else in the statutory text beyond the penultimate sentence, or is the penultimate sentence really the statutory basis for your argument?"
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2195.135,2195.48,No.
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.77,2392.015,I don't understand what you -- say it again.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2392.015,2392.845,Okay.
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.53,2396.0,Got it.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2396.0,2402.21,And it is an offense described in -- and I'm just referring to the first Federal statute that's listed there.
2015.14-1096,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2402.21,2402.62,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2403.54,2406.405,It's page 2A of the appendix to the government's brief.
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.445,2452.7,I see.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2452.7,2457.98,That's there clearly because Congress wanted to pick up State and foreign versions --
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.98,2458.35,"Right, right, right."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2458.35,2468.46,"-- of the crime, and to then drop away, as Congress does sometimes, the sort of more minor versions of those crimes where there are different sentencing and penalty schemes in place."
2015.14-1096,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2468.46,2478.97,Of course he's -- he's not arguing that -- that all -- all Federal jurisdictional requirements have to be one of the elements.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2488.415,2488.78,Yes.
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2491.76,2496.47,The basic point is I counted -- made an effort to count these.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2521.35,2521.57,Yeah.
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.57,2525.05,And it isn't really going to be the anomaly I thought it was.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2526.03,2527.86,"Yes, that's one of my points, certainly."
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.18,2562.655,It wouldn't be strange if those were things that covered offenses that it makes sense not to want to put in --
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2562.655,2562.85,Right.
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2562.85,2564.14,-- to the definition.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2564.14,2565.04,And I don't think you --
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.04,2567.775,"I thought that some of them did, but --"
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2567.775,2568.38,"Well, no."
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2568.38,2571.955,"The tax one, for example, the fraud -- tax fraud, but he uses different language."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2571.955,2572.39,Yes.
2015.14-1096,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.88,2624.16,"How do you deal with his lack of uniformity argument? That is, some crimes will -- under State law, the same conduct will be labeled by some States a felony, other States a misdemeanor, and you get a lot of these lesser-type offenses swept up into the provision that doesn't allow for cancellation of removal?"
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2624.16,2627.52,That's not a feature of the Board's interpretation in this case.
2015.14-1096,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2658.73,2669.455,"But I believe that Mr. Guadagno's point was that this is -- it's a reason why Congress may have used the language that it did, rather than, say, just arson."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2683.935,2692.215,"I think that would be, again, a sort of strange roundabout way to exclude them, and to move it back through the crime of violence provision, it would be a lot of work."
2015.14-1096,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2733.46,2741.815,"But this one -- this one wasn't -- I mean, his -- his crime, he got one-day jail time and five years of probation."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2761.39,2762.535,No.
2015.14-1096,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2762.535,2777.73,"So he's just stuck -- this is absolute? Even when it's a one-day jail time, a lesser crime, there's no -- you're really locked into no means to obtain cancellation of removal."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2777.73,2802.04,"That's right that he can't obtain cancellation of removal, and that's consistent with Congress's intent in putting the aggravated felony provision into place, which was to constrain the Attorney General's discretion and to make it so that the Attorney General was locked into certain conclusions. And that was because Congress thought that the way that the whole cancellation of removal process was working before the aggravated felony provision went into place was it wasn't working well."
2015.14-1096,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2812.845,2820.72,"I was just going to say, of course, the Attorney General may decide not to subject the alien to removal in the first place, right?"
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2820.72,2836.68,"That's true, yes. Although, aggravated felony is a ground for removal. But also, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that just because this Petitioner's sentence was one day and five years of probation does not mean that he committed a minor crime of some kind."
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.38,2861.18,"But the only thing you've been able to think of, my guess is, that gets around his argument that arson and explosives will be covered by the crime of violence is that: What if a person sets fire to his own property? Now, when would a person set fire to his own property? When he wants to commit fraud."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2898.035,2918.71,"I'm not sure that necessarily works under the categorical approach because it would depend what the person was actually prosecuted for in State court, and if they were prosecuted not for fraud, but simply for arson, and it was a provision that said -- that included arson against your own property, then I think you wouldn't fall into either one. But there's actually another reason that I didn't get to before why I think some arsons might not be crimes of violence."
2015.14-1096,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2943.395,2957.875,"So what do you think about this? I mean, I -- I think I dread the suggestion, but when I got into that, I thought, God, there is no way to avoid just doing this section by section and saying, what did Congress want, section by section."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2976.965,2985.44,"Although I hesitate to object to a helpful suggestion, I actually think that the answer here is to drop out the jurisdictional provision entirely and not to do that for a couple different reasons."
2015.14-1096,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2985.44,2985.81,"Well, we --"
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2985.81,2989.37,"First of all, I don't think it works for foreign crimes."
2015.14-1096,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3044.58,3047.605,Can I -- can I go back to your -- to your argument about Subsection (j)?
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3047.605,3048.515,Yes.
2015.14-1096,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3048.515,3056.11,Are there State RICO offenses for which a maximum -- the maximum term of imprisonment is less than a year?
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3056.11,3063.32,"I don't know the answer to that, but I think there might be -- there might be such offenses and there might be foreign offenses like that as well."
2015.14-1096,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3072.16,3075.2,Are there State or foreign RICO offenses at all?
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3075.2,3080.02,"I -- I -- I -- honestly, I don't know the answer to that, but I think there might well be."
2015.14-1096,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3080.02,3085.63,"There are State -- there are State RICO statutes, but RICO is a -- is a -- is regarded as a very serious crime."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3089.605,3100.21,"I mean, I seized on the RICO statute, but actually the very next provision in J, which is Section 1084, the same analysis would apply. Section 1084 is a statute that has an interstate commerce element in it."
2015.14-1096,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3185.18,3188.79,I can't square this with the categorical approach.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3208.58,3214.54,"Well, I think the thrust of the categorical approach is that you don't look at the particular conduct that the person engaged in."
2015.14-1096,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3290.92,3313.16,"But the Board's original decision was the other way, and it wasn't till the Circuit came -- came out, and then the Board went in line with the circuit so that the Board read it -- doesn't that dilute the strength of the Board's current position, that it was not its original position?"
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3313.16,3314.02,I don't think so.
2015.14-1096,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3350.995,3355.515,Am I not remembering this right? But wasn't there a change in position in Chevron --
2015.14-1096,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3355.515,3356.28,Yes.
2015.14-1096,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3356.28,3358.965,"-- itself? Well, there you go."
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3358.965,3359.805,There you go.
2015.14-1096,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3359.805,3360.945,I wasn't misremembering.
2015.14-1096,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3360.945,3361.84,Thank you.
2015.14-1096,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.84,3365.33,"Mr. Guadagno, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-1096,2,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,3365.33,3366.965,Okay.
2015.14-1096,2,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,3366.965,3370.735,Congress could -- could have utilized generic arson.
2015.14-1096,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3488.57,3502.59,"What do you do with -- if we rule your way, that it won't address the child pornography possession laws or that it won't address some of the explosion laws?"
2015.14-1096,2,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,3502.59,3507.91,"As I said before, there -- there is overlap and -- and that they're very likely --"
2015.14-1096,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3507.91,3511.025,"No, I want to know where the overlap is for the child pornography."
2015.14-1096,2,62608,matthew_l_guadagno,,3511.025,3530.805,"There -- there is -- on that one, I don't think there is -- there is any question about that because there is a Second Circuit case -- I believe it's called Ouch v. Holder, where -- where the government did not pursue the child pornography under -- under the provision my friend is referring to."
2015.14-1096,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3547.21,0.0,"Thank you, Mr. Guadagno, counsel. The case is submitted."
