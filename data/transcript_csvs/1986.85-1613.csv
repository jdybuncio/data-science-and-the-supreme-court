1986.85-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0,0,"You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Cohen."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Thank you.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,What is your idea of what 6(e) means?
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,--We think that 6(e) provides that those persons who properly have access to grand jury materials may not disclose them to other people without a court order.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Would the court order be routine?
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,No.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,There would be a hearing on it?
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Yes.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Mr. Cohen, I find the phrase"
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"No, and that is not what I meant."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Well, what if the government subpoenaed a whole bunch of documents from a particular witness before the grand jury."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""go out and say""."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Well, tell it to someone to whom disclosure is not authorized."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,I don't think that the fact that a particular contract was subpoenaed by the grand jury makes that contract privileged from future disclosure in circumstances where the disclosure would not reveal what the grand jury's activities were.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Well, what if a witness is subpoenaed before the grand jury and the witness says: On February 5th I met with Joe Jones."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,No.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Mr. Cohen, may I just follow up with the Chief Justice's question."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Yes.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Even though at least some people within the government, knowing the full scope of the government's civil investigation, some people would know that the only place that information could have come from was the grand jury?"
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Well, that's of course not the case here."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"No, that was no question."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Yes.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Let me just follow up.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"--Again, I think the answer is usually yes, they could, because it ought to be possible to frame an answer to that question that does not identify the grand jury proceedings as the source of that information."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Just identifies the name of the person who happened to be a witness and the government had never talked to except in that--
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,But it doesn't identify him as a witness.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,--I assume that the civil division lawyer or the criminal division lawyer assigned to the civil division who's working with someone else in that division.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,We don't--
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"He says witness X will say thus and such, right."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"--It's our position that if we need to bring in another lawyer with litigating responsibility and that lawyer has to learn matters occurring before the grand jury, we need a 6(e) order to do that."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Well now, that happened in this case, as I understand it, according to a letter to the Clerk of this Court, without a court order."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Something a little different from that happened in this case.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Do you defend that position here in the face of Sells Engineering?
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,I think that it raises a special question that the Court need not reach in this case.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,But did they formally respond by identifying the documents in response to the CID?
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Well, all three said, we have previously supplied all of the documents covered by the CID."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Do you think that's an adequate response to the statutory demand?
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,We accepted it under the circumstances.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Formally, on the record?"
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Well--
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"Does the record disclose there's been full compliance with the CID's, in other words, full responses to them?"
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,--We issued CID's that we considered were valid.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,I understand.
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"We issued them saying to the Respondents, you may respond by indicating that you have previously supplied documents that are covered by this CID."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,What I have in mind--
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"--argumentation, but then said, you have all the documents."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,"--I don't remember the terms of the statute well enough, but say you serve an interrogatory, you're entitled to a sworn answer that so and so is the case."
1986.85-1613,0,43522,,,0,0,Not a phone call.
1986.85-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0,0,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
1986.85-1613,0,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1613,1,43522,,,0,0,"Mr. Grand, I have not yet seen that letter."
1986.85-1613,2,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"I can't, Your Honor."
1986.85-1613,3,43522,,,0,0,What materials was it that you say were disclosed?
1986.85-1613,4,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,I can't answer that.
1986.85-1613,5,43522,,,0,0,Thank you.
1986.85-1613,6,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"And if you don't have a copy, Your Honor, I'll be happy to hand you."
1986.85-1613,7,43522,,,0,0,"Well it might increase the risk, but certainly studying it by itself does not amount to to disclosure, does it?"
1986.85-1613,8,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,I agree with Your Honor that the mere abstract study in the office does not increase the risk of disclosure.
1986.85-1613,9,43522,,,0,0,"Well, okay, let's stop."
1986.85-1613,10,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"I think, Your Honor, you've just hit on the key point."
1986.85-1613,11,43522,,,0,0,"Well, supposing the complaint alleges that some time during the year 1985 the defendants met and conspired to fix prices, and actually there was testimony before the grand jury that on particular dates particular defendants met at a particular place."
1986.85-1613,12,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,I think it is unquestionably disclosure of grand jury materials.
1986.85-1613,13,43522,,,0,0,What does that phrase mean?
1986.85-1613,14,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,Let me address that.
1986.85-1613,15,43522,,,0,0,Yes.
1986.85-1613,16,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,It forbids disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury.
1986.85-1613,17,43522,,,0,0,"Yes, but the fact--"
1986.85-1613,18,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,--for the simple reason of protecting the function of the grand jury.
1986.85-1613,19,43522,,,0,0,--The fact that a conspiracy took place on a certain date is not a matter occurring before the grand jury.
1986.85-1613,20,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,That is correct.
1986.85-1613,21,43522,,,0,0,"Well, if that's correct then your answer to the Chief Justice was wrong."
1986.85-1613,22,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,I don't think so.
1986.85-1613,23,43522,,,0,0,"I understand, but you're going to answer my question?"
1986.85-1613,24,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"What is a matter occurring before the grand jury is the fact of the investigation of that, the determination that that took place."
1986.85-1613,25,43522,,,0,0,"The fact that that was brought to the attention of the grand jury, right?"
1986.85-1613,26,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,Yes.
1986.85-1613,27,43522,,,0,0,"So you can use those facts as much as you like, so long as you don't disclose that those facts were presented to the grand jury, isn't that correct?"
1986.85-1613,28,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,I think it's that last jump--
1986.85-1613,29,43522,,,0,0,I didn't think it was a jump.
1986.85-1613,30,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"--Well, if it is not disclosing matters occurring before the grand jury to paint with a broad brush, to summarize the facts learned by the grand jury, then it will be equally permissible for the government midway through a grand jury investigation to issue a press release that simply says there was a conspiracy going on, to use your words, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1613,31,43522,,,0,0,"The only reason that would not be permissible is that, given that manner of disclosure, it is evident that... it is evident that what is being disclosed is not merely the fact of the conspiracy, but that the grand jury was told about the fact of that conspiracy."
1986.85-1613,32,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"I suggest to Your Honor that when the prosecutor is the person who is disclosing the matter in a civil complaint, you have exactly the same inference that flows, particularly when all of the witnesses and all of those subpoenaed to produce documents know that they've only been subpoenaed by the people who were running the grand jury."
1986.85-1613,33,43522,,,0,0,"But your trouble is he's no longer ""prosecutor"" in the civil case."
1986.85-1613,34,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1613,35,43522,,,0,0,I hope not.
1986.85-1613,36,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"I think that the question... I think that, first let me say that the question of disqualification I don't think is before the Court in this matter."
1986.85-1613,37,43522,,,0,0,"Well, how can he forget that the conspiracy happened on such a date?"
1986.85-1613,38,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"--If I may, I believe, Your Honor, that the question of whether a particular prosecutor in a particular case should be disqualified will be a function of how much that prosecutor learned in the grand jury, what his participation was, the relatedness of the civil case to the criminal case, the remoteness in time, all of which are questions more properly addressed to a district court, but none of which exist in this case, where the issue presented is can the prosecutor use, not simply remember in his head, but can the prosecutor use grand jury materials, testimony from several dozens of witnesses, I think is the phrase, and documents to prepare and litigate this case."
1986.85-1613,39,43522,,,0,0,That the conspiracy occurred in May of '84?
1986.85-1613,40,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,I believe he cannot use the fact that the conspiracy occurred--
1986.85-1613,41,43522,,,0,0,"Well, he must forget that?"
1986.85-1613,42,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,--in May of '84--
1986.85-1613,43,43522,,,0,0,He must forget that?
1986.85-1613,44,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"--I mean, if you're asking me am I arguing about whether he can use his own memory, I'm not arguing that."
1986.85-1613,45,43522,,,0,0,I don't see how you can get behind it.
1986.85-1613,46,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"In this case, this case that's before the Court, I don't think the question of the prosecutor's memory has arisen."
1986.85-1613,47,43522,,,0,0,You are in trouble with another point.
1986.85-1613,48,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,That is true.
1986.85-1613,49,43522,,,0,0,That's your real problem.
1986.85-1613,50,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"Well, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1613,51,43522,,,0,0,"Because he is not... as an antitrust lawyer, he is not automatically a prosecutor."
1986.85-1613,52,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"--The matter, this case, was referred by the AID agency to the Antitrust Division in 1981."
1986.85-1613,53,43522,,,0,0,"Mr. Grand, can I interrupt with, maybe it's a stupid question."
1986.85-1613,54,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,--I believe that there's no question that an indictment surely is a disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury.
1986.85-1613,55,43522,,,0,0,"Well, if they return the two pleadings simultaneously, they file an indictment and a civil complaint simultaneously, are both permitted disclosures or are both... or is it true that neither of them is a disclosure within the meaning of the rule?"
1986.85-1613,56,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"--To me they would both be disclosures, there's no question about it."
1986.85-1613,57,43522,,,0,0,And one is permitted and one is not.
1986.85-1613,58,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,One is permitted and one is not.
1986.85-1613,59,43522,,,0,0,"I suppose under your view of the situation it might be an unauthorized disclosure if the government attorneys tried to duplicate getting the information in the civil case, because they would have to rely on information disclosed before the grand jury to show who to subpoena and what evidence to request."
1986.85-1613,60,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,We have not... we do not feel that the issues in this case require us to go that far.
1986.85-1613,61,43522,,,0,0,"Well, it certainly sounds like your argument would lead you to that result."
1986.85-1613,62,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"Certainly other attorneys could do that, and in this case, as long ago as 1981, the Justice Department could have made the choice based on the reference from the AID agency, to look into the matter on a civil basis."
1986.85-1613,63,43522,,,0,0,Your argument just leads to the inevitable conclusion that the Justice Department has no choice.
1986.85-1613,64,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"I don't think so, Your Honor, for the following reasons."
1986.85-1613,65,43522,,,0,0,"Well, if your argument is right, then the Court of Appeals was clearly wrong when it said there is no particularized need here for the government, because they can go out and duplicate the discovery on their own, because under your view they couldn't."
1986.85-1613,66,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1986.85-1613,67,43522,,,0,0,I don't see how you can have it both ways.
1986.85-1613,68,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"Well, there was no attempt in November of 1984, when the government sought a 6(e) order ex parte, there was no attempt by the government to make any showing of particularized need to reveal grand jury materials."
1986.85-1613,69,43522,,,0,0,"It would not make any difference to your analysis, Mr. Grand, I take it, that the prosecutor may have known completely about what a witness was to testify to and having gone over the testimony word for word before the witness ever testified before the grand jury?"
1986.85-1613,70,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"Not in this case, in light of the way the issues have been framed and the concessions made."
1986.85-1613,71,43522,,,0,0,So what you're really--
1986.85-1613,72,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,--Excuse me.
1986.85-1613,73,43522,,,0,0,--What you're really arguing for is not just non-disclosure.
1986.85-1613,74,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"--No, I'm not."
1986.85-1613,75,43522,,,0,0,"Well, I don't see how."
1986.85-1613,76,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"Most respectfully, I'm not."
1986.85-1613,77,43522,,,0,0,I don't see how you can escape that if the prosecutor knew about it without recourse to the grand jury and before the grand jury ever sat.
1986.85-1613,78,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,Then I agree with you.
1986.85-1613,79,43522,,,0,0,"You agree then that if the prosecutor knew of a particular piece of testimony or of a document without recourse to grand jury subpoena, then it would not be disclosure for him to talk about it?"
1986.85-1613,80,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,--My understanding is that that accurately states the broad status of the law on that subject.
1986.85-1613,81,43522,,,0,0,"Mr. Grand, about your proposition that it doesn't really inhibit the government very much to have to conduct a separate civil proceeding."
1986.85-1613,82,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,I'm smiling only because I wish it was still the case.
1986.85-1613,83,43522,,,0,0,It's not still the case?
1986.85-1613,84,37946,paul_r_grand,,0,0,"It's not still the case, and we have a number of clients who are suffering because of it."
1986.85-1613,84,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0,0,"Thank you, Mr. Grand."
1986.85-1613,85,43522,,,0,0,"Yes, a couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1613,85,43522,,,0,0,"Mr. Cohen, what about disclosure to secretaries and such?"
1986.85-1613,85,43522,,,0,0,I don't think it should be.
1986.85-1613,85,43522,,,0,0,"I'm sorry, I know you want to go on."
1986.85-1613,85,43522,,,0,0,"It doesn't embrace disclosure by attorneys to other people who are assisting them, such as economists and accountants."
1986.85-1613,85,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0,0,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
