2000.99-1132,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.487,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1132, Illinois v. Charles McArthur."
2000.99-1132,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,9.392,10.883,Thank you.
2000.99-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,40.88,58.885,"May I stop you there, please, counsel? As it turns out, and you mentioned, at the end of the day the respondent would have entered the home and destroyed the evidence if he'd had the chance, but the police didn't know that at the time, did they?"
2000.99-1132,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,58.885,61.139,"I don't think they knew it, certainly, Your Honor."
2000.99-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,61.139,67.091,And I think that we have to take the case on the assumption that they didn't know.
2000.99-1132,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,67.091,67.873,Correct.
2000.99-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.873,69.059,Isn't that right?
2000.99-1132,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,69.059,69.557,I agree.
2000.99-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,69.557,75.452,So I don't think we should look at the fact that he said that later in resolving the case.
2000.99-1132,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,75.452,78.218,"Your Honor, by mentioning that I didn't mean to suggest that the Court should."
2000.99-1132,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,84.753,85.235,Yes.
2000.99-1132,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,85.235,87.355,But I agree that the officers certainly didn't know it.
2000.99-1132,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,970.983,977.184,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1132,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.279,1026.859,"Mr. Roberts, do you think all evidence is fungible?"
2000.99-1132,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1026.859,1038.013,"No, all evidence is not fungible, Your Honor, but almost all evidence is capable of alteration or destruction, or damage in some way."
2000.99-1132,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.013,1041.053,Is all evidence that's capable of alteration or destruction fungible?
2000.99-1132,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1041.053,1042.361,No.
2000.99-1132,2,21035,deanne_f_jones,,1513.717,1519.499,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1132,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.213,1573.635,"Well, it was suggested in Segura, I guess, as a possible rule."
2000.99-1132,2,21035,deanne_f_jones,,1573.635,1599.885,"Your Honor, in the dicta in Segura there is some suggestion that external seizure of the home would have been justified in Segura's case, and perhaps that is because everyone with a possessory interest in the apartment in Segura was in custody and therefore the police really weren't interfering with anyone's possessory right."
2000.99-1132,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1619.841,1619.841,"Well, what should the police have done to preserve evidence that they know is at risk?"
2000.99-1132,2,21035,deanne_f_jones,,1619.841,1628.448,"Your Honor, there were two alternatives for the police in this case."
2000.99-1132,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1647.159,1651.311,"Well, but they knew of the risk of destruction of the evidence."
2000.99-1132,2,21035,deanne_f_jones,,1660.465,1673.019,"--No, Your Honor, there is nothing they could do, and the reason I'm suggesting that is, in Welsh v. Wisconsin the officers on that scene were faced with a similar dilemma."
2000.99-1132,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.721,1695.916,"Well, the offense in Welsh was quite different than the one here."
2000.99-1132,2,21035,deanne_f_jones,,1692.721,1709.677,"--Your Honor, there is a distinction between the offense here and the one in Welsh."
2000.99-1132,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.505,1719.619,"Well, is that important, Ms. Jones, to your argument?"
2000.99-1132,2,21035,deanne_f_jones,,1725.303,1728.439,"Yes, Your Honor, it would make this case different, for two reasons."
2000.99-1132,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1759.242,1764.327,But the police had no way of knowing the quantity at that point.
2000.99-1132,2,21035,deanne_f_jones,,1790.987,1793.231,"Two responses to that, Your Honor."
2000.99-1132,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1809.831,1815.152,"Well, is it exigent circumstances if it's a felony but not if it's a misdemeanor?"
2000.99-1132,2,21035,deanne_f_jones,,1825.58,1838.562,"I am, Your Honor, that's true, and the reason I make the distinction is again, it's part of that analysis of whether or not the exigent circumstance of destruction of evidence is present."
2000.99-1132,3,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,3401.055,3393.015,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-1132,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.701,3393.015,"Mr. Bertocchi, I would not normally intrude upon your time, but you know, I've just criticized or discussed with Ms. Jones whether she wasn't altering the question presented."
2000.99-1132,3,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,3456.849,3473.533,"Your Honor, I believe when I was addressing the question of exigent circumstances that I was doing so in response to specific questions about the facts of this case, and it is our position that if the Court were to determine that particularized exigent circumstances were necessary, then they were present if the Court wanted to ask that."
