1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.673,We’ll hear arguments next in Tate against Short.
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,29.207,30.111,Thank you.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,76.315,80.549,How many different times was he arrested for driving a car without an operator’s license?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,80.549,82.402,There were nine offenses.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,82.402,83.6,Operator’s license?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,83.6,87.645,I think there were three of those.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,87.645,90.045,Any indication why he didn’t go down and get a license?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,90.045,92.89,"No, there’s nothing in the record on that."
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,92.89,94.994,How much do they cost?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,94.994,96.421,I don’t know that.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,101.088,103.33,$2.00.
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,103.33,109.486,"Neither alone, as I said, or taken together were these offenses punishable by a jail sentence."
1970.324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,244.208,247.24,That same friend didn’t help him out with the fines?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,247.24,250.899,No he did not Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,318.942,321.764,Did he own a car?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,321.764,324.818,That does not appear in the record.
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,340.063,341.591,"Well, he could’ve sold it?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,341.591,343.08,"Well, he might have done that."
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,343.08,360.234,"Well, what happens if a man has 64 charges of driving without a license, reckless driving and doing bodily harm with an automobile and he’s broke?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,360.234,374.487,"Well, the first thing that has to happen is -- if he has no money, the court as this -- the lower court, the criminal court as this Court said in the Williams case last year has several alternatives."
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,394.211,395.886,Well you know the prison farm isn’t --
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,395.886,396.32,"No, no."
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,409.593,411.443,"Well, I’m sure Texas doesn’t have one?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,411.443,412.717,"No, they do not, they do not."
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,412.717,422.956,Would that be a constitutionally any less offensive if he was only confined 12 hours a day instead of 24?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,422.956,433.922,"Well, if he were confined only for the purpose of having him work out on a job, the fine we suggest would not be constitutionally offensive."
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,452.761,472.239,"Wouldn’t that be something at least resembling involuntary servitude if the sentence of the court was that he fend 12 hours a day at the local prison farm, at least eight hours of which should be spent working at $2.00 an hour?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,472.239,482.065,"I don’t think it would be because of course there is a specific exception in the Thirteenth Amendment for persons convicted of a crime, but even more important that --"
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,482.065,482.7,But this --
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,482.7,496.499,"The state -- we are not claiming, I wish to be perfectly clear, we are not claiming that the state is powerless to get at the kind of person that Mr. Marshall’s -- that Mr. Justice Marshall’s question referred to.W"
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.233,641.699,Will that if this get a -- this $425.00 out of figure?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,641.699,642.569,Pardon me?
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,642.569,650.601,"$425.00 figure, I would assume maybe he got a $100.00 a month, he could’ve paid that two buck fine."
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,650.601,656.48,"Well, he had a wife and two children and a $104.00 a month --"
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,656.48,662.435,"Well, for example he could’ve bought a little less gasoline and paid the $2.00 fine."
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,662.435,662.983,Well --
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,662.983,667.572,"And I want to suggest the one thing, it might turn out to be it was gasoline."
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,667.572,668.147,Well --
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,668.147,672.681,What I mean is $2.00-fine is different from a $100.00?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,672.681,673.859,I think that’s right.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.009,755.483,"And that's or you say Mr. Dorsen could be met by Texas if it showed upon investigation, find that this man is to be sure not able to pay the whole $425.00 now, but that he can reasonably afford to pay $10.00 a month --"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,755.483,756.013,That’s correct.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,756.013,759.33,-- that he does get it the very least a $104.00 a month from the veterans --
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,759.33,760.04,That’s correct sir.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,760.04,761.444,-- whether or not he’s employed or --
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,761.444,762.381,That is correct sir.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,762.381,770.279,"-- and that -- so then they are in to do that, and he doesn’t pay the $10.00 a month, can they then put him in jail?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,770.279,776.453,Well we would say in a case like that that the court should then hold the kind of informal hearing --
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.453,783.97,"Well, it’s had the hearing and it’s found that he can afford to pay $10.00 a month out of a $104.00 a month, then he doesn’t pay it, then can they put him in jail?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,783.97,788.411,I would say that’s a case of willful refusal to pay and they could put him in jail.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,792.766,803.239,"And that even this Court -- even this Court which other Texas law has no power to do anything but fine people as you point out, nonetheless you concede that under the constitution, it could put him in jail if he didn’t pay the $10.00 a month?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,803.239,812.695,We would concede that the willful refusal and I think it’s pertinent in that connection because I’m glad that became clear that --
1970.324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,812.695,818.852,"Mr. Dorsen, let me interrupt you now and help me out in this respect."
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,832.274,834.378,If the fine were only $10.00?
1970.324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,834.378,842.025,"No, if there were no fine, the statute were ten days in jail for this offense, the statute ordinance?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,842.025,843.452,I assume we would not be.
1970.324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,843.452,845.216,You would not be here.
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,863.222,864.771,There might be such a tendency.
1970.324,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,989.44,1004.944,"My only suggestion is that if you prevail here, you may provide an impetus for just that thing, and of course it ties in with the thinking of some people that one of the solutions to our traffic carnage is to impose differ --"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1004.944,1005.783,That may well be.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1159.5,1164.47,"What was the maximum fine I wonder that he could’ve totaled, aggregate fine?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1168.766,1170.255,It’s not clear on the record.
1970.324,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.034,1175.773,Per offense?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1175.773,1176.223,That’s right.
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1272.605,1274.316,When was the statute passed in Texas?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1276.874,1279.78,"It’s a rather old statute, I believe."
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1294.652,1304.191,"Well, I suppose you’d agree in terms of the economic argument you’re making that at the turn of the century, $5.00 a day might not be irrational, might not have been irrational?"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1304.191,1305.286,Yes.
1970.324,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.87,1344.439,It would be the same if there was a thousand dollars to pay your argument would be the same?
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1344.439,1345.667,That’s correct.
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1353.537,1368.523,"I take it if you from your argument that he could be put on a state prison farm and required to work eight hours a day out of $2.00 an hour rate or something, perhaps something geared to the minimum --"
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1368.523,1368.888,Yes.
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1368.888,1381.381,"-- wages under the federal act that he could also be put on a road gang, on a construction job, or any other work under compelled state supervision."
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1381.381,1382.679,I think he could be.
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1393.485,1400.771,"When you say the state should follow, you’re then talking in terms of advice to the state legislatures."
1970.324,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,1405.383,1407.729,I did not mean to put it that way.
1970.324,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1472.018,1476.099,Very well Mr. Dorsen.
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1476.099,1479.625,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1553.829,1565.723,What was he -- did I understand you say that he -- Texas found him guilty of two offenses for not having a driver’s license on a single day?
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1565.723,1581.413,"No sir, the day of his trial, the day that the jury found him guilty and fined him a $50.00-fine and a $25.00-fine that same evening -- the offense had occurred I think a week or so earlier, but then on then on the day of his --"
1970.324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.413,1583.867,"Yes but -- the day of the trial, you mean he was coming homing from the trial?"
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1583.867,1595.325,"No -- I doubt it Your Honor, because it was 6:30 something p.m., and I don’t believe that he would be coming home from the trial, but nonetheless, it was the same day."
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1701.582,1707.079,What effort was made during this year of two period to collect the fines?
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1707.079,1711.589,"That Mr. Justice Marshall, I don’t know."
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1711.589,1721.914,"Well now at the hearing when he was sent away, what happened there other than that you don’t have the money so you go?"
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1721.914,1722.807,"Yes sir, that’s it."
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1722.807,1723.508,That’s all?
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1723.508,1726.288,Yes.
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1726.288,1732.974,"Well, it would’ve been possible to find out whether he could’ve paid it in installment?"
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1738.521,1746.78,There is no provision in our law for paying a misdemeanor of this type out in installments.
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1746.78,1757.98,"Well, is there anything in your law that prohibits it?"
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1758.506,1758.871,I’d --
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1758.871,1772.931,"-- at least I would assume that in this particular case, if the judge had said on the day he was fined $75.00, you have got two years to pay this $75.00."
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1777.504,1779.711,Two years?
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1781.864,1782.909,Well isn’t that what happened?
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1787.667,1797.494,"It was two years before they -- actually what happened here, they had some capiases out for him on some of these other subsequent offenses, and they finally arrested him."
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.327,1806.578,You didn’t deliberately delay that that was --
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1806.578,1808.394,"No sir, no sir."
1970.324,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1828.411,1831.847,Did he have all one of the defense for these cases?
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1831.847,1841.192,"Seven of them were nolo contendere, and two that the jury -- he pled not guilty on two, the jury found him guilty."
1970.324,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1841.192,1844.157,What was his defense?
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1844.157,1845.562,I don’t know sir.
1970.324,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1854.778,1856.787,"Well, I asked what his defense was, or has been?"
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1856.787,1863.743,"In the habeas corpus hearing, their only defense was that he was too poor to pay the fine."
1970.324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1863.743,1877.261,"To pursue Justice Marshall’s question about installment payments, I assume Texas charges interest on its outstanding fine, wasn’t it?"
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1877.261,1879.226,"No sir, we do not."
1970.324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.226,1882.964,So at least he doesn’t have $3.00 a month interest running on him --
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1882.964,1883.327,No sir.
1970.324,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1883.327,1884.167,-- on that $10.00?
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1884.167,1885.092,No sir.
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.128,1934.076,I assume you’re also make the point that it’s different from when he first was picked up and convicted and got $75.00 if the judge had said “Either this or you go to jail.”
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,1945.462,1963.356,"As far as the equity is yes, but as far as the law is concerned, we think that the -- when the man could have -- if he had just obeyed the law right there, none of this trouble would’ve happened, but he chose to disobey the law."
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.214,2008.619,"Mr. Rollins, my final point is the same judge does have right of probation, and do you not have a probation department in Houston?"
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,2008.619,2009.294,"No sir, not on this --"
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.294,2014.527,"I think that they could it -- no, but I’m -- you do have a probation department?"
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,2014.527,2029.066,"The district attorney has a probation department, and they -- but on this type of fine, there is a city ordinance which allows the judge to delay collection of the fine 30 days --"
1970.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.066,2029.564,I see.
1970.324,1,32629,joseph_g_rollins,,2029.564,2032.143,-- upon application of the defendant.
1970.324,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3027.285,3029.171,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.324,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.019,3126.586,"The P. Farm, is that capital P period for abbreviation for prison, or is it pea where they grow peas?"
1970.324,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3126.586,3131.561,"I think it’s the first, the former."
1970.324,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3209.419,3213.946,What -- Can I ask you what Mr. Tate’s occupation is?
1970.324,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3213.946,3216.253,I’m not sure what his occupation was.
1970.324,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3220.64,3222.384,What kind of car was this?
