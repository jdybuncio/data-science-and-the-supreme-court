1991.91-611,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.679,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-611, Keyton Barker and Pauline Barker v. Kansas."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,53.916,58.67,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-611,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,95.666,97.837,"The Court also construed a statute, didn't it?"
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,97.837,100.859,"That is correct, Your Honor, it construed a statute which this Court--"
1991.91-611,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,100.859,105.881,And just said that that incorporates the intergovernmental rules.
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,105.881,118.089,"--Your Honor, I believe in the Davis case the Court said that 4 U.S.C., section 111 is coextensive with, and thus fully preserves the modern doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity."
1991.91-611,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,118.089,119.809,So all you need is the statute?
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,119.809,135.19,"Your Honor, perhaps the statute is sufficient in and of itself because it plainly prohibits discrimination against Federal officers or employees because of the Federal source of their pay or compensation."
1991.91-611,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.481,337.884,"Well, did Kansas rely on some Federal cases that hold that military retirement benefits are not deferred compensation, but instead are reduced pay for current services?"
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,337.884,339.304,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.355,342.685,Are those cases wrong?
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,342.685,345.948,"--Your Honor, those cases are not wrong for what they stand for."
1991.91-611,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.809,382.944,"Well, I guess the answer to the question almost depends on the lens with which you're viewing it."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,390.489,391.351,Your Honor--
1991.91-611,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.351,395.653,When do we recognize them and when don't we?
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,395.653,403.559,"--Your Honor, there are differences between retired members of the military and other forms of government retirees."
1991.91-611,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.67,457.873,"Now if you win here, the holding presumably would be retroactive?"
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,457.873,473.484,"--Your Honor, under the general rule applicable in civil cases, I believe this Court has recognized, we would assume that it would be retroactive at least for the parties before the Court."
1991.91-611,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,479.658,480.698,"Well, it's certainly lurking there."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,487.122,503.044,"--Your Honor, in our judgment, there is no retroactivity question presented by this case for the simple reason that reversal of the decision below simply requires application of 4 U.S.C. section 111."
1991.91-611,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,503.044,510.727,"Well, but didn't the Jim Beam opinion indicate that if we don't say anything about it, then it is generally retroactive?"
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,510.727,511.839,That's correct.
1991.91-611,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,511.839,514.169,So you're saying don't say anything about it.
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,515.972,518.812,"Well, Your Honor, that would suit just fine with me."
1991.91-611,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.002,541.249,"Well, you don't think it's bad that if these retirees' money has been taken from them unconstitutionally it should be given back."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,543.88,545.362,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.668,602.807,May I ask--
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,602.807,606.461,"Now if this were an ambiguous statute, perhaps the conclusion might be different."
1991.91-611,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.273,611.433,"--Of course, it's a statute that gives consent to tax."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,624.624,625.725,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.725,634.24,"Now, what if Kansas, in its retirement system, had several categories of State employees, and didn't tax... or did tax two or three of those categories."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,636.691,638.551,"It wouldn't eliminate the discrimination, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,668.822,683.952,"Well, supposing the State gave a tax... tax-free retirement benefits to only 10 percent of its retirees, and Federal retirees, 90 percent were tax-free under the State but there were 10 percent that were taxed."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,686.854,694.187,"Your Honor, I think that it would depend upon the purpose behind the exemptions, and the classification as it's drawn."
1991.91-611,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.187,697.059,"Well, the purpose in the State exemptions is to increase... encourage people to work for the State."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,700.432,707.528,"Your Honor, the Court recognized in Davis that simply relying upon that legitimate State purpose is not a basis for discrimination."
1991.91-611,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,732.622,740.129,"What all that boils down to is that if they give a tax-free retirement benefit to any State employees, they must give them to all Federal employees."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,741.689,743.541,"--We're not suggesting that, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.58,776.782,"Because if you examine it as a whole, the Federal employees are basically treated like everybody else in Kansas."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,780.614,797.564,"Well, Your Honor, this small group of people that get a special benefit, as this Court recognized in Davis, because they are in privity with the State, the danger that a State is violating the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity is greatest in this case."
1991.91-611,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.359,972.722,"Well, don't... don't the military get some benefit?"
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,983.42,984.922,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1031.571,1040.438,"No, but it does tend to distinguish the military retirees from the Federal Government as a whole retirees that were involved in the Davis case."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,1040.438,1045.058,"Your Honor, there may be distinguishing features."
1991.91-611,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1067.145,1071.326,I must say it's hard to say what's relevant to a legitimate aspect of tax policy.
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,1082.863,1086.336,"Your Honor, perhaps I misspoke."
1991.91-611,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1120.697,1128.193,Do you really want to rest on the question of what is a legitimate justification as opposed to what is a generally applicable distinction within the tax structure?
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,1128.193,1129.014,Your Honor--
1991.91-611,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1129.014,1140.912,"If Kansas generally drew a distinction between the taxation of deferred income and reduced income for reduced services you wouldn't be here, would you?"
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,1140.912,1147.047,"--That may or may not be true, Your Honor, because Kansas has not drawn that distinction."
1991.91-611,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1179.427,1184.741,"So you're saying we can't avoid the substantive inquiry, even though we would in a first-tier equal protection case?"
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,1184.741,1185.66,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.638,1198.66,"Well, and because... because of the statute."
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,1198.66,1204.563,--Because of 4 U.S.C. section 111.
1991.91-611,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1204.563,1205.244,Yes.
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,1205.244,1210.357,"And the modern doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity, the heart of which is nondiscrimination."
1991.91-611,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.357,1211.919,"Well, why do you need more than the statute?"
1991.91-611,0,33818,kevin_m_fowler,,1211.919,1216.391,"Your Honor, perhaps we don't need more than the statute."
1991.91-611,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1231.161,1235.285,"Mr. Manning, we'll hear from you."
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1235.285,1246.551,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-611,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.51,1274.769,It really doesn't prohibit it.
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1276.431,1287.046,"It does... by negative implication, I believe... in... this Court, in Davis held that by negative implication it also prohibits it and that it's coextensive with the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity."
1991.91-611,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1330.294,1345.284,"Assuming the case in which a State made a difference between contributory and noncontributory plans for taxation or exemption of retirement benefits, and it just so happened that Federal employees were disadvantaged, would that be a legitimate tax distinction in your view?"
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1345.284,1356.974,We believe that a neutrally drawn classification that attempted to account for double taxation by reference to the manner of funding would be a legitimate classification and would survive scrutiny under section 111.
1991.91-611,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1476.801,1485.307,How many other States have a plan like Kansas that singles out retired military?
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1485.307,1487.771,"--Justice O'Connor, I'm not aware of the exact number."
1991.91-611,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.4,1520.101,But there've been amendments in some of those States since Davis?
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1520.101,1525.435,"--There have been... 19 States, I believe, have amended their statutes in the aftermath of Davis to--"
1991.91-611,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1525.435,1527.645,And three or four that have not?
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1527.645,1536.271,--At least three or four have not taken into account the military retired... have not treated military retired pay the way they have treated Federal civil servants.
1991.91-611,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.437,1576.719,Excuse me.
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1592.888,1596.541,"--I'm... no, Your Honor, I don't believe that they would."
1991.91-611,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.395,1614.463,"Say their reason for doing it was they wanted to treat all law enforcement and military people alike, figuring that they're somewhat... the most comparable State employees, and they wanted the tax."
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1620.768,1642.69,"--The assertion that military retirees are most like State and local police would not be sufficient to overcome the requirements of the quality that are imposed by section 111, which states that the State cannot discriminate against Federal employees... as extended to retirees in Davis, or as applied to retirees in Davis... because of the source of their compensation."
1991.91-611,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.692,1665.796,"So that if they grant any tax-free retirement benefits to even a tiny fraction of their retired work force, they must grant all Federal employees the tax-free--"
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1665.796,1670.719,--It would depend on whether they applied their classification in a neutral and even-handed way.
1991.91-611,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.483,1736.205,--That's your... that's your patent officer example.
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1741.238,1742.931,"That... that's right, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.031,1786.049,"Well, excuse me."
1991.91-611,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1803.871,1805.663,"--You're absolutely right, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.132,1822.725,"Thank you, Mr. Manning."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,1825.166,1834.612,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.246,1932.591,But what indication is there that that's the distinction that the State was drawing?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,1939.174,1939.945,Well--
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.945,1945.309,"And they are not in the same position that military retirees are, subject to recall."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,1945.309,1952.234,"--First, I'm not sure that we have any CIA retirees in the State of Kansas."
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1953.893,1955.035,What difference does that make?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,1955.035,1958.908,"Yes, the CIA, that's secret."
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.908,1963.941,"Yes, that's right."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,1968.495,1970.176,"I believe that's correct, yes."
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.176,1976.7,"Yes, now that has nothing to do with the distinction you're justifying the tax on the military retirees by."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,1990.208,1991.16,I wanted to get to--
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.16,1991.74,Good.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,1991.74,1992.569,--that question of uniforms in a minute.
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.739,2009.232,"But you'd have another one for them, right?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2009.232,2010.311,Perhaps we would.
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.311,2010.691,I see.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2010.691,2011.793,"Or, Your Honor, perhaps we wouldn't."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.255,2051.648,"So is it... is it your submission that under a properly drawn statute... and, of course, you would say that this is one... but under a properly drawn statute, the State of Kansas could say if any retiree has current obligations the payments received by him are taxable?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2054.65,2055.251,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2063.656,2065.279,So it's not the obligations; it's the pay?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2065.279,2076.625,"--We make the point of the continuing obligations that the military retirees owe to the Federal Government, because that is characteristic of a class of people who are receiving current compensation."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2079.657,2086.272,And so we know whether or not there's current versus... pay versus some other kind of pay because they have current obligations to perform.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2088.053,2089.735,"I think that is one indicia, yes."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.735,2092.777,And what are those current obligations here?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2092.777,2099.68,The current obligations are that military retirees are not retired from the military service.
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2155.448,2162.944,But why do all of these factors you've just mentioned... how do they bear on any sort of tax policy the State might have?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2162.944,2174.161,"Well, I cite all those differences because I do believe they all go to our ultimate point: that military retirees are receiving current compensation, that they are current employees."
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.161,2175.682,"Well, I have the same problem as the Chief Justice."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2192.603,2202.159,"Well, the legislature, in drawing these distinctions... and, of course, our legislature is keenly aware of the military retirees and the fact that their retirement pay is taxable."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.351,2212.766,"But what is it that would motive the decision to tax, versus to exempt on this criterion?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2212.766,2214.778,On the distinction between current pay--
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2214.778,2215.188,Yes.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2215.188,2215.919,--versus deferred compensation?
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2215.919,2219.632,Yes.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2219.632,2228.197,"Well, that has traditionally been a very significant for... very significant difference for purposes of taxation on both the Federal and the State level."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2239.406,2247.4,"Well, is the... is the theory that it... in the case of the military officer it's earned for current status?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2247.4,2247.64,It is.
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2248.381,2249.593,Is that the theoretical difference?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2249.593,2258.652,"--I believe it's correct that it is earned on an ongoing basis, that it's not a vested right, not an enforceable right to receive military retired pay."
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.894,2271.839,"Well, you can say that about some of your State employees who are disabled."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2276.671,2279.904,I think there are very narrow restrictions.
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.904,2285.286,"Well, whatever they are, if they violate those restrictions they can be deprived of their retirement income."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2287.99,2292.404,"That point, Your Honor, I don't believe I could agree with."
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.311,2348.862,Here's one of the examples I was thinking of.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2376.23,2383.955,--The retired State employees have a vested right to receive their retirement.
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.883,2412.334,"Well, I must say... in fairness to you... the Government puts it in a footnote with a lot of other things where... the kind of things that you mention, if a State employee goes back to work for the State he would forfeit it."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2424.843,2427.215,"--Again, Your Honor, I'm not aware that that is the case."
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.215,2428.017,You may be right.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2428.017,2431.038,"I would like to focus, for a moment, on the Davis case."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2539.922,2544.086,What fiscal period does that cover?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2545.526,2553.543,"That covers the tax year 1988 and all years forward, together with interest calculated at the statutory rate on the tax refunds."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2553.543,2554.502,And why do you cut it off at 1988?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2557.446,2560.355,"Your Honor, did I say 1988?"
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2560.355,2560.816,--Yes.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2560.816,2565.361,"Well, what I meant to say was from tax year 1984 and all years forward."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2565.361,2566.56,'84.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2567.942,2576.197,That is the... earliest year under our statute of limitations that the taxpayers could claim income tax refunds.
1991.91-611,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2576.197,2585.504,You mean anyone can come forward now... not merely the parties to this case... but anyone can come forward now and still file a timely claim as to 1984?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2585.504,2588.355,"Your Honor, this matter has been certified as a class action."
1991.91-611,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2589.955,2590.375,I see.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2590.375,2591.407,--all military retirees in the State.
1991.91-611,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2593.959,2594.37,I see.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2594.37,2595.949,--as covered by the outcome of this litigation.
1991.91-611,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2595.949,2605.676,"I take it Kansas does not have a requirement to pay under protest, or to raise a protest in payment in order to go after a refund later?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2605.676,2606.697,That is not a requirement.
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.697,2614.271,I don't... most of the times when we have objections to retroactivity we're talking about a change in the law.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2634.625,2639.099,"I think the point, Your Honor, this case is, of course, derived from the Davis case."
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.129,2658.991,"Davis wasn't a constitutional case, really."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2662.243,2662.724,"--It was, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.751,2676.655,"Well, it... I'm not sure whether that's in your favor or not."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2676.655,2680.475,"Well, I'm just trying to say what I believe is the case."
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.475,2685.871,And 111 has been on the books quite awhile.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2685.871,2687.423,"It has, Your Honor, over 50 years."
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.298,2728.103,"The special class as viewed by the States was really their own retirees, wasn't it?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2729.833,2739.13,--I think the States operated on the assumption that there was nothing impermissible about them according some favorable tax treatment to its own employees and retirees.
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.13,2749.367,"Well, of course, you aren't arguing here... you aren't arguing to sustain that broad notion that the States had."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2755.118,2755.689,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.652,2765.346,"And you're saying that... awhile ago you said well, maybe we're in trouble with respect to other types of Government employees who might be taxed."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2765.346,2769.911,I'm afraid I don't understand Your Honor's question.
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.911,2772.191,"Well, I'm going back to the CIA example."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2786.51,2787.422,"I believe that's true, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.459,2808.708,"And yet you say the States, up until the time of Davis, thought that they could tax all Government retirees... United States retirees... including Kansas."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2808.708,2810.649,--While exempting... while exempting their own retirees?
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2810.649,2811.059,Yes.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2811.059,2820.024,"Your Honor, Kansas was not directly affected by the Davis decision because Kansas does not tax Federal Civil Service retirees, and it hasn't taxed them for more than 30 years."
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.024,2820.685,I know.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2822.056,2823.518,"Correct, correct."
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.846,2839.678,Why did they do that?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2840.299,2842.81,"I can't tell you precisely, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2852.628,2866.465,"Well, Mr. Bartle, there are, though, some other classifications of Federal retired people who are subject to the Kansas tax, in addition to the military retirees."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2866.465,2867.386,Correct.
1991.91-611,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2867.386,2882.186,"And as to those other classifications, Kansas does not have and does not purport to rely on the differences that it's trying to articulate with regard to military."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2882.186,2883.709,Precisely.
1991.91-611,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2891.874,2906.903,"Well, the problem is, we have to look at all of the classes of Federal employees, I suppose, that Kansas says we can tax, and try to figure out if there's some legitimate State policy being implemented."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2919.62,2922.204,It certainly would make the Court's task much easier.
1991.91-611,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.204,2937.312,"Well, at least the fact that you tax some other classes of Federal employees for which you don't have the military argument sort of impugns the State's submission that you are not taxing military just because of the source."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2937.312,2941.404,I can see Your Honor's point.
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.151,2984.565,"What is the explanation for that, if it's not too indelicate to inquire?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,2996.35,2999.672,--I can see Your Honor's point.
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3055.31,3057.743,"Now, would you refresh my recollection?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3063.127,3069.321,Virtually all State and local government retirees are all exempt.
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.321,3069.972,They're all exempt.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3073.075,3081.31,"I think that comparing the facts in Davis to the facts of this case... as I said, Davis involved Federal Civil Service retirees and retired State employees."
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3109.46,3119.196,"Mr. Bartle, as a practical matter, you know, how often are military retirees called up, do you think?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3119.196,3124.94,I mentioned earlier that there was quite a few retirees recalled to serve in the Persian Gulf.
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.683,3134.625,"Now, was that a call-up of retirees who put in 20 years, rather than National Guard or Reserves?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3134.625,3137.018,--There were Reserves called up; there were National Guard called up.
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.489,3143.232,Do you have any idea how many?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3143.232,3146.084,"I believe the number runs into the thousands, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.084,3147.344,Throughout the country?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3147.344,3152.166,"Yes, they were assigned to both foreign posts and posts here in the United States."
1991.91-611,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3163.555,3169.809,"But of course, when they were called up, I suppose they got their regular pay, and not just their retirement, for retired service."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3169.809,3170.889,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-611,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.9,3265.765,"Is there any indication of that rationale in the history of this statute... I mean, in the legislative debates or anything else?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3300.42,3305.222,"Your Honor, out statutes do not state that a tax shall be imposed on military retirees."
1991.91-611,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3316.6,3322.195,It is not given the same exemption that other retirement pay is.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3322.195,3323.244,"That is correct, yes."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3323.244,3324.826,"That's singled out, I think."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3324.826,3333.212,It's not singled out in the same manner that there is a specific provision that says we are setting aside this discrete group of taxpayers.
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3358.838,3360.778,"Well, I don't think he conceded that."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3373.788,3386.677,"Well, I took his comments to mean that if the statute set out, in specific terms, a neutral classification, a neutral basis for different tax treatment, that that would be permissible."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3459.804,3468.432,"Well, do you think the statute, section 111, requires some sort of interference with the Federal operations before it can be applied?"
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3468.432,3475.816,I think the statute prohibits a tax that discriminates because the Federal Government is the source of the pay of compensation.
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3494.119,3498.683,"Well, the statute certainly doesn't contain that additional language."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3501.865,3507.388,That's what I believe arises out of the principle that they are prohibiting a tax that discriminates based on the source.
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3531.986,3535.656,Would that be under its power to enforce sovereign immunity?
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3535.656,3537.749,"--Yes, Congress may, by statute--"
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3537.749,3549.106,"Well, but that... but I thought you agreed that the Constitution and the statute here are coterminous, so far as... so far as the doctrine of governmental Immunity is concerned."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3549.106,3550.876,"--Yes, I did say that... the current statute."
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3552.709,3557.101,"But if... but if it fails under the current statute, the Congress would have no constitutional power to do that."
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3557.101,3558.493,--Correct.
1991.91-611,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3558.493,3559.432,Unless it's under some other clause.
1991.91-611,2,28916,james_a_d_bartle,,3559.432,3560.143,Correct.
1991.91-611,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3573.122,3574.902,"Thank you, Mr. Bartle."
