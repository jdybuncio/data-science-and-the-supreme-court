2010.09-350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.761,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-350, Los Angeles County v. Humphries."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,9.246,12.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.015,83.574,"What was the -- what was the basis for that exception, that declaratory judgment does not affect the fisc of the--"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,83.574,86.339,"Yes, essentially in the--"
2010.09-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,86.339,89.541,"--It does -- it does, though, if you have attorneys' fees."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,92.882,97.769,"--As to the county, it's $58,000."
2010.09-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,103.236,104.301,What is far above?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,106.657,108.079,600-and-some-odd thousand dollars.
2010.09-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,108.079,110.407,--the case is mostly about attorneys' fees.
2010.09-350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,110.407,114.544,But there was no objection on the part of the State.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,119.731,120.433,Correct.
2010.09-350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.853,123.338,And the State is not contesting it.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,123.338,125.117,"The State has not contested that, correct."
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,125.117,129.07,Does the State make that payment under an Ex Parte Young theory?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,129.07,131.254,"Yes, yes."
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,134.864,149.281,"If you sue the municipality, if they deny a marriage license, do you have to sue under 1983, or you can just sue alleging a Federal cause of action under -- because of a denial of a constitutional right?"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,149.281,150.467,"Well, it would have to be--"
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.467,152.03,"It would be like a Bivens action, I guess."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,152.03,157.26,"--It would have to be -- the Court has recognized, against local municipalities, liability under section 1983."
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.26,161.151,The only way to sue a municipality for a constitutional violation is under 1983?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,161.151,164.15,"In a direct civil cause of action, I believe that is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.15,172.694,"Well, you could get the individual officer who is denying the marriage license or whatever the offensive act is."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,179.362,180.157,That is correct.
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,181.296,183.92,But could you sue outside of 1983?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,183.92,187.266,"The individual, for a Federal constitutional remedy?"
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.266,194.528,Just to get -- the marriage license example -- just to get an order demanding issuance of the license.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,194.528,198.151,"No, I believe you would still have to have an operative statute."
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.493,203.711,And that has to be a statute -- it has to be 1983?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,203.711,208.005,"--I believe for a constitutional claim of this type, it would be section 1983."
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,213.375,227.757,"--ignore the injunction, can you go to the State and force the State to -- in that circumstance, to get someone to issue the license on your behalf?"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,227.757,231.148,"Are we talking about the State, or are you referring to the municipality?"
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,231.148,231.554,Or the municipality.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,232.287,237.239,"You would not, unless you showed that there was a policy, custom, or practice."
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,238.222,251.984,"So what you are saying is that a State agent or a municipality can continue to ignore a constitutional violation until, what -- you are denied the license five times?"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,251.984,252.608,"--Well, no."
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,252.608,256.449,How many times do you have to show that you are not getting that license that you are entitled to?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,256.449,264.182,"Well, say, for example, that once brought to the attention of a policymaking official that this is what was going on, then you have the deliberate indifference by a policymaking official."
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.852,268.398,All right.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,298.525,309.21,"Well, the difficulty in this case is with respect to that there are no State standards in terms of evaluating the accuracy or when someone is removed, when someone wants to be removed from the database."
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,324.968,326.0,But that's what it is charged with doing.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,346.429,353.612,Because it's not so much that they are inaccurate; it's the standards used to remove someone from the list or not.
2010.09-350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,370.494,373.041,"Well, the Respondents here argue that, don't they?"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,377.197,377.743,Correct.
2010.09-350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,377.743,392.346,"Now, if the -- presumably, that could be brought to the -- that could be brought before someone who is a county policymaker, couldn't it, when you are talking about something that's going -- that's ongoing in the future?"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,392.346,393.329,That's true.
2010.09-350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,395.782,397.314,And then that would fall within Monell.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,397.314,398.016,Correct.
2010.09-350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,398.016,402.045,So that's why I'm somewhat puzzled about what this case is about.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,414.699,417.994,"No, I agree with Your Honor."
2010.09-350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,437.234,450.605,"You concede, I take it, or acknowledge that one episode can be the basis -- I mean, going forward -- for a determination that the defendant has a policy, custom, or practice."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,450.605,450.979,You can.
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,457.304,465.361,"Well, that's your adversary's argument, which is by this lawsuit, you have been told that there's something wrong."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,492.006,501.676,"The one thing I said that it wasn't doing is figuring out whether this met the policy, custom, or practice requirement of Monell, because under its case law it doesn't have to do so."
2010.09-350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,523.401,527.429,"Now, if that's the case, why wouldn't one of the following be possible?"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,551.868,563.629,"The way the lower courts have, in the context of liability, viewed this requirement where State law requires a local entity to do something is they have virtually said that they are standing in the shoes of the State."
2010.09-350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,574.859,576.107,An Ex Parte Young situation.
2010.09-350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,576.107,578.42,"And they have sued the State here, right?"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,578.42,579.344,"They have, yes."
2010.09-350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,579.344,580.248,Or under Ex Parte Young?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,580.248,588.138,"They have indeed sued the State here and we submit that they can get full relief with respect to the database from the State, should they choose to pursue that."
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,588.138,589.666,Who would they sue to do that?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,597.134,598.289,They may--
2010.09-350,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,598.289,602.223,So who -- who do they sue in the State to--
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,602.223,606.145,"--They have sued the Attorney General, though the Department of Justice maintains the database."
2010.09-350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,654.714,674.406,"What would happen under California law if you said, we agree with the Respondents that additional procedures are constitutionally required, so even though California law doesn't allow this, we are going to create these procedures because we have to comply with the Constitution."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,680.295,683.403,There would be a possible preemption argument.
2010.09-350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,688.621,690.149,I'm sorry?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,690.149,696.634,"They could say it is preempted and move for an injunction from doing it, because they are interested in maintaining the database."
2010.09-350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.634,698.272,"Who is the ""they"" who would do this?"
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,698.272,704.113,The State of California would come in and argue that the county was preempted from using these regulations.
2010.09-350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,709.019,725.744,"This is getting further removed from the situation that we're dealing with, because the State has already admitted liability and not contested that it owes fees."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,742.566,752.406,I believe the appropriate remedy for the plaintiffs would be to apply in a district court if they believe they have a valid injunction on valid declaratory relief vis-a-vis the State and move forward from there.
2010.09-350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,768.101,770.273,But the State has already conceded.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,781.098,782.221,They should.
2010.09-350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.825,884.868,It's true that all cases that at least come to us under Monell have involved damages.
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,884.868,886.478,--That is correct.
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,949.994,954.665,Can Bivens actions be brought against municipalities?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,954.665,956.275,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,959.009,971.316,"And you cite the authority for -- would -- do you think that the rationale for that is that since Congress has created an express cause of action, this impliedly preempts a Bivens-type action."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,971.316,973.11,"--Yes, that's my recollection."
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,973.874,977.891,And have -- have we said that in a case?
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,977.891,979.466,Off the top of my head--
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,979.466,988.229,"Because it seems to me it would help you in this case, because you would say, well, if there's a real problem, the city -- the injured party can sue for an injunction."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1007.239,1010.705,"--Well, I mean, it is independent of what remedies might occur under State law."
2010.09-350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1016.843,1018.122,"No, I'm talking about under Federal law."
2010.09-350,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1018.122,1023.106,--My understanding with respect to a general constitutional claim is it is section 1983.
2010.09-350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1042.567,1043.831,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1046.985,1050.608,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1119.64,1126.905,"It's the same statutory language that you are relying on, right, that was held to require causation in the one case?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1129.639,1137.244,"Your Honor, we believe it does require causation, but the question is what kind of facts have to be shown to prove causation."
2010.09-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1158.078,1165.639,"But then you are not really hurt, or the system isn't really hurt by the rule that the city asks for."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1182.1,1185.726,"--Your Honor, we think that it should be easy."
2010.09-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1210.074,1213.431,I'm not sure I understand your submission.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1227.552,1230.316,I guess I need to clarify.
2010.09-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1230.316,1232.484,"And your answer is it's so easy to do, it doesn't make any difference."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1235.452,1254.946,"Because I think what the city has said, Your Honor, is what Monell requires is for the plaintiff to show something in addition to what the plaintiff has to -- to what the plaintiff has to show to, A, prove a constitutional violation, and B, prove an entitlement to prospective relief."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1281.731,1283.073,So that's what you think.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1301.491,1305.472,"Your Honor, we agree that causation is required."
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1322.196,1325.492,"Counsel, could you stop talking in the abstract--"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1325.492,1325.913,--Sure.
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1325.913,1327.586,--and give me an example.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1347.387,1352.137,"I'm sorry, Your Honor -- where the Monell couldn't be satisfied?"
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.137,1352.543,Exactly.
2010.09-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.543,1354.462,Well--
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1354.462,1361.726,"I think this case, to the extent that what the city is saying is that Monell was not satisfied here, is a perfect example, because here--"
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1361.726,1363.349,"Monell doesn't apply to State officials, right?"
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1363.349,1364.054,No.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1373.424,1380.388,"--Well, if I may, Your Honor, just to respond to the Chief Justice's statement--"
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1380.388,1380.622,Thank you.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1380.622,1389.12,--The Petitioner's position is that this standard would apply also in Ex Parte Young actions against state officials.
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1391.214,1392.571,"That, of course, isn't before us."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1392.571,1393.554,--It's not before you.
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1419.809,1427.464,"Well, that would require -- that would require us to get into the question of whether Ex Parte Young is a fiction or substance, which I certainly wouldn't like to get into."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1427.464,1436.289,"--Well, but it might not, Your Honor, because it might turn just on whether -- I mean, Ex Parte Young suits against State officials are under 1983."
2010.09-350,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1452.908,1454.812,I have a question similar to Justice Sotomayor's.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1485.021,1492.126,"I think, Your Honor, we gave some examples in our -- in our brief."
2010.09-350,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1501.9,1501.915,All right.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1528.666,1536.305,"--It may be, but I don't think the Court has required that there be some exhaustion of administrative remedies."
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1617.836,1621.349,What is the answer to Justice Alito's question?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1653.508,1653.898,Right.
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1653.898,1655.395,What's the harm in that?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1676.713,1685.979,"Your Honor, it's the -- I think in your hypothetical -- I may have misunderstood it, but this was a sort of a one-off decision by the -- by the clerk."
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1685.979,1688.382,There are two possibilities -- three possibilities.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1711.982,1713.295,"Well, I guess my--"
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.295,1714.855,"So -- so -- so, why--"
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.855,1716.699,Or there is no city policy.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1716.699,1721.305,"--Well, I was just going to add that -- I was just going to add that example, where the city just is agnostic."
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1722.447,1727.602,"--If there is no city policy, then the city hasn't done anything wrong under Monell."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1738.705,1740.066,"--My argument is this, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1763.178,1764.332,If you are right about that--
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1764.332,1764.706,--that there is no relief.
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1764.706,1765.33,--All right.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1776.651,1780.168,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.679,1797.38,"Justice Breyer's question said you need a city policy, and you said that's exactly right."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1805.561,1808.985,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that--"
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1808.985,1810.093,But the Ninth Circuit didn't.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1810.093,1812.561,"--Well, first of all, the Ninth Circuit didn't."
2010.09-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1813.747,1814.777,--Did not?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1815.526,1815.682,--Did not.
2010.09-350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1815.682,1816.711,"You agree with that statement, yes?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1816.711,1853.46,"And I go back to our position, which is: If causation is required, which it is, the question on which I think guidance for the lower courts would be very helpful is not to simply say Monell is -- Monell applies; adopt our jurisprudence that was focused on retrospective conduct or prospective conduct, but rather, yes, Monell's causation requirement applies, but we recognize in this context it is likely to be satisfied by the other things that the plaintiff is required to prove."
2010.09-350,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1853.46,1861.895,"That is not what the Ninth Circuit -- the Ninth Circuit said, we are not deciding the Monell question; we are leaving that -- we are leaving that open."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1904.891,1911.014,"And, Your Honor, my response to that is that Monell was not wrong."
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1956.95,1964.881,I -- I -- I'm still -- I am sort of asking for a hypothetical and to take it from the abstract.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1977.238,1977.769,Uh-huh.
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1977.769,1983.626,That's the ongoing failure that you are alleging entitles you to injunctive relief?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1983.626,1985.123,I think that--
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1985.123,1989.015,Or was it that you thought the city could remove the name?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1993.777,2012.611,"--The continuing violation here is that every day for the past 9 years, our Respondents have suffered a violation of their due process rights, because they have not been given any sufficient process to show that they are wrongfully included in the index."
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2012.611,2022.516,"So to prove a future violation, you have to show that the municipality can do that; correct?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2022.516,2024.216,And the court of appeals held that twice in this case.
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2025.355,2025.542,Right.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2032.273,2033.369,"--We think it is, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2033.369,2035.553,--their failure or omission could be anything but.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2035.553,2038.283,"We think it is, Your Honor, and that's why we--"
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2038.283,2039.004,But you don't think that--
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2039.004,2039.737,--think it is in this case.
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2039.737,2042.518,--I think your friend agrees.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2068.207,2071.787,"And there is that inaction here, because the court of appeals--"
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2071.787,2081.626,"Now you are arguing whether Monell was satisfied or not, and you are get ago chance to do that on remand because the Ninth Circuit has said we are giving -- we are making the city pay and now we are finding out if they violating anything."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2081.626,2099.79,"--I agree, Your Honor, but -- but by -- by issuing a declaratory judgment and by finding that there was no standing for it here, the lower court necessarily concluded that the city -- that there that was the readressability element was satisfied and that the continuing harm element was satisfied."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2099.79,2101.618,So the Ninth Circuit was wrong to send it back for a hearing?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2101.618,2103.256,The Ninth Circuit--
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2103.256,2105.85,Because you have already shown Monell was satisfied.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2105.85,2109.488,"--The Ninth Circuit, I think devised -- recognized that there were two different claims in this case."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.066,2120.906,"--but, yes, damages, but turning on whether Monell was satisfied."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2122.251,2123.219,--But--
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2123.219,2124.764,Go ahead.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2124.764,2125.419,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2178.523,2185.896,How can you get relief -- how can you get relief going forward under Monell unless there has been a city violation before?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2195.469,2222.66,"--But it is not necessarily true in this particular case that the policy -- that the policy was in effect from day one as opposed to something that -- that came into -- that -- the municipal responsibility might not have come to pass until later when a policymaker -- the city might say when -- when these decisions were additionally -- initially made, no policymaker knew what our process was for determining the accuracy fees."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2222.66,2223.69,If you were sued--
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2223.69,2232.983,The lawsuit got filed and in 2006 somebody decided because the city took the position in the lawsuit and has -- has determined that it is not going to implement a policy--
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.983,2236.809,"But the test would be the same going forward, right?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2237.685,2238.434,--But the facts--
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.434,2246.307,"--The same test would apply to both damages, going forward after the date of the filing of the suit, and injunction according to your reasoning, right?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2246.307,2254.068,"--If -- if -- if the damages -- if the injunctive test is satisfied, yes."
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.88,2260.739,From the time the lawsuit is filed both -- the injunctive test will also be the damages test.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2260.739,2280.058,"--But the difference, I think, Your Honor, is to recover damages, the plaintiff doesn't have to show that the other elements of the damages claim don't encompass the kind of requirements of municipal -- of municipal involvement that is encompassed within the other elements of the prospective relief claim."
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.57,2294.396,Let me follow this.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2303.953,2314.217,I think it means you would have to show all the requisites but you could decide that you just want to collect damages from the day you filed the suit.
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.217,2333.067,"Well, in -- if that's the complaint that you filed, then -- then in that kind of a suit the test for damages and the test for injunction would be precisely the same; and you would be able to get damages on the basis of the mere fact that the suit exists, right?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2340.409,2344.889,"Well, there might be a question about the precise timing on which a--"
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2344.889,2348.185,"--I'm sorry, answer."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2348.185,2352.747,--On which -- it might not be the actual day of the filing of the complaint.
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2357.462,2362.882,"Well, but it's not -- defending the suit doesn't give rise to a municipal custom, policy or practice?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2378.047,2379.517,And is continuing to do.
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.517,2388.513,"Well -- or continuing to do, I mean, the suit doesn't satisfy the requirement of showing a policy or practice, because they may defend on the ground that it is not unconstitutional."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2396.574,2403.319,"And I think that is -- that is an example, to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question, of a case that would be problematic."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2439.727,2441.32,And so the city--
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2441.32,2441.928,Under--
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.928,2443.676,--The city is in a Catch-22 position.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2474.385,2494.751,"--But the alternative is to say, even if it turns out that there is unconstitutional action going on, that the city has become aware of, that the plaintiff who shows that does not get any relief and has to continue to suffer the unconstitutional violation for some indefinite period of time."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2494.751,2497.438,"Well, you've got to get relief against the city."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2512.853,2520.317,"But at the time of the lawsuit the plaintiff can't get prospective relief against anyone, because he can't get prospective relief against the city."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2526.833,2533.36,"He is not -- he is not entitled to prospective relief against the city, because the city has not caused the alleged harm."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2536.313,2537.124,But that--
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2537.124,2545.262,"If you establish what the employee is doing in a suit against the employee, which the city is defending because he's one of their employees, then the city is put to a choice."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2552.944,2566.534,"--But, Your Honor, I think the consequence of that structure is, that the city can leave the employee -- there is no remedy against an employee who is engaging in unconstitutional conduct."
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2566.534,2567.517,--against State.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2600.456,2602.126,"Well, two answers, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.126,2602.956,What is wrong with that?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2602.956,2605.483,The Court of Appeals held that they do have the power to do it.
2010.09-350,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2609.687,2612.031,Why did the State -- why did they send it back?
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2615.638,2630.88,"Look, they sent it -- one of the reasons they sent it back was to -- for -- so that the procedures could be provided or an injunction could be entered, directing the county to do what the statute requires, which is exercise its responsibility under the statute to make sure that the submissions are accurate."
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.88,2653.198,"Mr. Pincus, why -- why do you accept, as I think you did under the Chief Justice's question, that if the city has a policy which it believes is constitutional, but in fact is unconstitutional, that is not a city policy for purposes of Monell?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2653.198,2655.601,"If I accepted that, I was wrong, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2655.601,2656.165,"Well, I think you did."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2656.165,2657.164,I think -- I think it is a policy.
2010.09-350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2657.959,2662.07,"Even if they think it is a policy, it's still a policy, isn't it?"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2662.07,2662.46,--Yes.
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2665.91,2675.187,"What I'd like the answer to is whether or not merely defending the employee in court is sufficient to establish that the city has that policy, custom or practice."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2675.187,2678.482,"--I'm not sure that it's the act of defending it in court, Your Honor."
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2687.26,2687.572,"Oh, sure."
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2699.739,2705.312,"No, I'm not -- I don't think that courts have said that filing a lawsuit is an impermissible way to do that."
2010.09-350,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2753.748,2763.523,"You realize that -- the Ninth Circuit to have said, there is a policy whatever, because the city's notice and they have done nothing about it, therefore--"
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2763.523,2764.1,Right.
2010.09-350,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2764.1,2767.835,--But the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't say that.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2801.899,2815.113,"That's the only thing that the county petitioned from, Your Honor, but I think more is at stake here because if this rule applied then it would not only preclude attorneys fees, it would also preclude the awarding of any relief."
2010.09-350,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2840.68,2843.21,I'm still waiting to hear what cases it will screen out.
2010.09-350,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2847.366,2851.005,We think properly applied it shouldn't screen out any case because--
2010.09-350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2851.005,2853.379,"--Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-350,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2856.296,2872.834,I think it's telling that we don't have an example of circumstances where applying the Monell standards someone couldn't get prospective relief where it was appropriate where the injury was actually inflicted by the municipality.
2010.09-350,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2881.285,2883.161,"Well, they gave you an example."
2010.09-350,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2919.41,2926.406,Assuming that the city's acceptance of that policy wasn't what led the clerk to make that decision.
2010.09-350,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2932.057,2940.351,"How is that different from what the Chief Justice proposed, which is, no, we didn't have a policy, but we are going to defend you anyway because we think it's okay."
2010.09-350,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2941.712,2942.087,No.
2010.09-350,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2951.035,2956.238,"They are not going to say that, they are going to say, policy, no policy, we don't even think that way."
2010.09-350,3,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2978.602,2988.505,"In those circumstances where the public is not a party, you can only hold the public party liability when its policy actually inflicted that injury."
2010.09-350,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2996.188,3017.007,"So we are now going to have a situation where what you are proposing is that you have to sue the individual actor, get a ruling on the constitutionality of whatever is being done, and then let that suit finish and ask the municipality to perform or not perform, and if it doesn't then you relitigate all these issues?"
2010.09-350,4,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3017.007,3023.364,In the second lawsuit the municipality is being held liable for its unconstitutional conduct.
2010.09-350,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3068.22,3082.824,"But whether you were free to do it or not under California law, how can there not -- how can it not be your policy that you have refused to provide these procedures which they say are constitutionally required?"
2010.09-350,4,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3120.477,3122.899,For a couple of reasons.
2010.09-350,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3146.343,3150.952,"Yes, but all that is involved is money between -- between California and a creature of California."
2010.09-350,4,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3170.223,3176.689,"--Well, the constitutional concern is that it injects a Federal court in a very direct into the way municipalities operate under California law."
2010.09-350,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3220.453,3231.337,"But do you think that the Federal court has to decide the issue of California law, namely, whether you have freedom under this particular statute to add an additional procedures to the California statute?"
2010.09-350,4,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3231.337,3235.804,"They will have to -- whether we -- yes, I believe they will, to determine whether, in fact, it's a county policy or custom."
2010.09-350,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3235.804,3238.113,"Well, isn't that something that should be decided in State court?"
2010.09-350,4,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3243.253,3253.719,"It's very much like the McMillian -- the McMillian case, Your Honor, with the -- the -- the State sheriff in Alabama, who's a county sheriff, and the question was, for Monell purposes, does he act on behalf of the State or does he act on behalf of the county?"
2010.09-350,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3266.791,3292.141,"And California itself or the Ninth Circuit had a case in which the county sheriff was directed by a judge to garnish certain wages or certain accounts, the sheriff had no choice, apparently, other than to follow the judge, and the Ninth Circuit held that Monell is not required when you seek declaratory relief against future actions, and so attorneys fees are given."
2010.09-350,4,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3292.141,3292.796,--Correct.
2010.09-350,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3299.792,3300.483,It doesn't make any difference?
2010.09-350,4,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3300.483,3302.324,--It doesn't make any difference to the Ninth Circuit.
2010.09-350,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3328.202,3329.653,"Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted."
