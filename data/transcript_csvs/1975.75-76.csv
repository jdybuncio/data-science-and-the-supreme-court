1975.75-76,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.031,We will hear arguments next in South Dakota against Opperman.
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,36.194,39.288,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1975.75-76,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,164.404,170.021,"Mr. Janklow you drawn the distinction, what is the difference between the inventory and the search?"
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,170.021,176.487,"I think in our brief, we attempted to draw the distinction between an inventory and search, and frankly we no longer do that."
1975.75-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,195.715,205.454,"Mr. Janklow, does the record show, what the Police standard procedure is with respect to ascertaining the ownership of the vehicle and where the owner might be?"
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,205.454,209.696,"It does not Your Honor, and I am -- since our office did not handle it I do not know."
1975.75-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,212.429,217.786,"It is a sign, for example and whether there was a license on the car or anything like that?"
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,217.786,219.343,As far I can -- that is correct.
1975.75-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.343,222.876,I have this; I just wanted you to confirm that.
1975.75-76,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,222.876,226.954,Practice varied depending on whether or not the car door is a locked?
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,226.954,234.102,"It does not, Your Honor, because of the fact that after this -- they have had several instances where cars had been vandalized."
1975.75-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,313.446,321.025,"What is the practice, Mr. Janklow, do they take it out of the car then, these items or do they leave them in?"
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,321.025,346.166,"No Sir, they were taken out of the car and they were in this case, all of these items to the Vermillion Police Department pursuant -- after they filled out an inventory sheet and approximately 5 a.m., or I should say 5 p.m. of the same afternoon, Mr. Opperman, respondent Opperman came to the Vermillion Police Department, picked up his belongings and his valuables, received them back with the exception of the Marijuana where warrant was served at him."
1975.75-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.724,358.002,Also does the records tell us what the standard procedure would have been if there had not been a valuable article such as a watch in plain view?
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,358.002,367.981,To my understanding Mr. Justice Stevens that all of the cars that are impounded by the Vermillion Police Department involved having the contents inventoried for the protection of --
1975.75-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,367.981,371.913,You do not rely particularly on the fact that they saw the watch in the back seat or whatever it was?
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,371.913,372.497,No.
1975.75-76,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.497,373.002,I see.
1975.75-76,0,45112,william_j_janklow,,373.002,374.653,I do not.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1044.644,1048.824,Very well Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1104.785,1108.601,"What duties the Policeman have been looking up, he left the car."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1108.601,1111.575,"Well, I think the argument to that Mr. Justice Marshall would be that --"
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1111.575,1116.611,Do you have any place where did do anymore and check to see if it is a stolen car?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1116.611,1116.89,It can all but there is --
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1116.89,1120.547,"You called up all the cars that were seized in New York, you will be busy all day?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1120.547,1146.899,"No, but I think perhaps the scope of this decision would be in the areas where perhaps the owner would be present at the time the initial seizure occurred and the argument that I wish to make, and I feel that this particular fact should be brought on, if Mr. Opperman were present when they have towed his car, he should have been given the opportunity or preference at least some choice to whatever you want his automobile is search."
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1146.899,1149.41,"Well, you should not have left it on the street?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1149.41,1150.045,"Well, the automobile was —"
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.045,1151.502,Illegally.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1151.502,1157.76,The automobile was left there due to a malfunction in the automobile; it was not there by choice.
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1160.38,1162.128,It is not Police’s problem.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1162.128,1164.326,"No, I understand that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.75,1168.192,That was very well be an abandoned car?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1168.192,1174.378,"We are not, Mr. Justice Marshall, we are not arguing the position that the initial seizure in this case was improper."
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1178.297,1184.1,I am trying to find where you get that they should have notified him or gone to look for him?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1184.1,1184.812,"Well, I think perhaps --"
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1184.812,1188.52,Do you insist that that is in this case?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1188.52,1190.849,"No, I do not want to insist that it be done."
1975.75-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.496,1218.57,"If you come on to an abandon car, may the police go in a glove compartment to see to whom it belongs?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1218.57,1220.133,I do not believe so.
1975.75-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.975,1230.064,They have to go into my glove compartment to find out to whom my car belongs.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1230.064,1230.748,Our state law --
1975.75-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.748,1233.633,That is where I keep my registration.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1233.633,1237.787,Our state law does not require that you keep your registration in your vehicle.
1975.75-76,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.312,1243.755,"So, you can keep it in your wallet then."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1243.755,1245.099,"Yes, that is correct."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1246.415,1251.499,I suppose that the car with a Pennsylvania license tagged on it.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1256.395,1279.789,"No, I only brought that fact to light again Mr. Chief Justice is for the Court’s attention that if the situation would arise as a result of this holding a rule or law which would be the establishment by holding of this case that if the owner is present, perhaps the best way to handle is protection of his privacy and the protection of his property Argument, would be the give him the preference."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1279.789,1301.107,"But going back to the situation as here, an apparently abandoned car or at least the car left alone overtime and do you say that they had no power to search the car for whatever records or papers might indicate the identity of the owner?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1301.107,1303.904,"Yes, that is my position Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1320.854,1322.309,By doing what?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1322.309,1322.729,Pardon?
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1322.729,1323.66,By calling --
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1323.66,1334.197,"They radio the State Bureau of Motor Vehicles, and it takes about three minutes to determine who the registered owner of that vehicle would be."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1334.197,1345.305,"Well, what if they find the ticket of the card, the ownership card or the driver’s license in the car, you said they have no right to take that easier step?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1345.305,1352.214,I am saying they have no right to take that step because they would have no expectation of finding this particular document in the automobile.
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1355.555,1362.755,That does not mean that there would be no expectation; it is not required in many places but in many places that is where you would find it.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1362.755,1363.041,Well.
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1363.041,1367.924,"As Justice White suggested that is where you would find it in his car, that where you would find in my car."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1367.924,1389.91,"Well, I think the better argument be rather than do breaking into the automobile with the use of a tool, and perhaps going one more step further in this argument if the glove compartment was locked also breaking into that, particular closed area that it would be much easier to pick up the radio on a police unit and radio into the Department of Motor Vehicles and have your answer back in three minutes."
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1389.91,1394.502,Why did you do that before they tow the car away?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1404.022,1410.471,I did not argue the point Mr. Justice Marshall that there is a duty to notify.
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.471,1412.302,"If it is not a duty, what is it?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1414.362,1416.558,"Yes, that would be --"
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.558,1419.475,We discuss the constitutional statutory rights here.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1422.291,1425.343,"Well, I think this is what the State’s argument goes to either."
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1433.68,1437.896,"It was not locked, it was unlocked."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1437.896,1439.754,The close compartment --
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1439.754,1441.386,The compartment was unlocked.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1441.386,1444.383,"Well, this is an area that the record is unclear."
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1452.773,1454.938,"So, that is just (Inaudible)"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1458.222,1461.438,"Well, I do not see any distinction between --"
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1461.438,1469.933,I do not see any reason why you keep emphasizing that they had some kind of a duty to notify him that they had towed his car away.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1481.054,1481.226,Well --
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.226,1483.056,Is that the usual procedure in Vermillion?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1483.056,1483.911,"Well, rather --"
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1483.911,1485.676,Is that the usual procedure there?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1485.676,1487.175,I think it would be yes.
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1487.175,1489.379,"Well, that was they were doing?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1489.379,1490.575,I agree.
1975.75-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.994,1522.384,"But Mr. Ulrich you keep referring to the desirability giving him a choice, if he had been present."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1527.625,1529.327,"Yes, I agree that it is."
1975.75-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.327,1541.821,"Now, assuming he is not present, what exactly is the obligation of the police and under your theory of the case, before they may make a thorough search of the car, including the glove compartment?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1541.821,1554.238,"My position is the only way that they could make a thorough search of the car after the initial seizure would be to follow one of the prescribed exceptions, automobile exceptions for the warrant requirement on a consent search."
1975.75-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.073,1578.669,Assume that they are unable by looking at the license plate or seeing any other indicia of ownership in plain view.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1586.044,1588.62,"I think in this particular case, it would be unreasonable."
1975.75-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.62,1595.562,"So that if they get an abandoned car and they cannot identify the owner, you would say that police may never go into the private areas of the car?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1595.562,1598.672,"No, I think it would depend on time element."
1975.75-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.686,1631.914,"Would you say the same thing if it was apparent that the vehicle had been stolen, and then abandoned on the street?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1633.46,1646.997,"I think in the stolen vehicle type argument, perhaps it still not be search, in those arguments, the police are going and notify the owner of the recovery of this automobile."
1975.75-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.957,1666.563,"But basically you are saying, I think that no search, if you know the owner, without first notifying the owner?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1666.563,1668.758,"Yes, I guess that is basically what my argument."
1975.75-76,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1668.758,1670.921,It is an affirmative duty to contact the owner.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1670.921,1672.01,Yes.
1975.75-76,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.83,1781.481,Mr. Ulrich does not the notion of probable cause almost not land itself when you depart from the idea of a search with the object of taking incriminating evidence?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1800.82,1804.159,I do not believe you would have to.
1975.75-76,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.619,1825.585,"Well, I am suggesting is that perhaps the line of analysis should be reasonableness which is the language of the Amendment rather than probable cause when you get out the side of the area you have searching for criminal evidence."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1825.585,1827.822,"Yes, I agree with your position."
1975.75-76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1855.554,1857.86,"Population of Vermillion is about 10,000?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1857.86,1866.783,"The standing population is 5,000, and when the University is in session, the population will be in the neighborhood of 10,000."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.204,1891.307,It might have been there for three days of three weeks?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1892.576,1892.956,Pardon?
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1892.956,1895.389,It might have been there for three days or three weeks?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1895.389,1908.71,"Yes, there is a possibility that it is happening, but I think in those particular cases, a search or entry into the automobile maybe justified under some time element reasoning which exist in Cooper."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1908.71,1912.101,Let me ask you another one hypothetical question.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1915.524,1917.399,"No, they did not."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.399,1929.428,"Suppose they did enter the trunk and found inside the trunk some incriminating evidence, you say that would similarly be subject to suppression and exclusion?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1929.428,1930.088,That would be my --
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1930.088,1939.764,"Suppose when they open the trunk, they found small child, bound in the gagged, victim of kidnapping."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1946.193,1959.206,"That would be my position that that evidence would not be admissible, the entry into a closed part of the vehicle without any justification or without any basis of reasonableness would offend Fourth Amendment standards."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.206,1969.214,Suppose this hypothetical kidnapped victim were 10-12 years old and vigorous enough to kick on the trunk of the car and make a little noise.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1971.807,1976.467,"Yes, it would definitely alter situation; it would give the Officer --"
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1976.467,1980.998,"How would it alter, because it gave some probable cause to --"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,1980.998,1994.141,It would give a reasonable foundation for the Officer to believe that the vehicle did contain something which should be removed immediately and he would be justified.
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.141,2000.056,"Then they have the right to go in, in your view, then to see whether it was just a hunting dog or kidnapped?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2000.056,2006.719,"Yes, in my view, that would constitute reasonableness in light of Fourth Amendment standards."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.719,2015.147,"Well, if he they just stumbled down and by accidents, then they could not prove or use that evidence against him."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2015.147,2018.608,"Well, my answer to that question would be yes."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.89,2031.653,What record do you suggest supports all that?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2031.653,2039.238,From the mere fact that the entry was gained into an area of privacy would -- no foundation of reasonableness.
1975.75-76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.238,2045.418,"There is no claim in this case that it is, like the Harris case and that this was a plain view case."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2046.863,2050.255,"Well, the State seems to make that argument."
1975.75-76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.931,2056.942,"They cited harris is a relevant decision, that is one thing."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2064.225,2067.444,"No, this case is completely different than Harris."
1975.75-76,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2080.751,2090.878,"Do you think the watch on the dash board, being in plain view, supplied the element of reasonableness that you mentioned?"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2090.878,2099.599,"I would like to answer that question, and Mr. Janklow’s position was that Opperman did concede the initial entry onto this automobile."
1975.75-76,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2143.774,2152.584,Suppose instead of a wrist watch on the dashboard there had been a beautiful diamond broche.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2159.307,2172.412,"I think perhaps the better argument between the initial entry and the alternative argument of no entry what at all, that will make the better argument is that that would justify an entry into the automobile."
1975.75-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.753,2188.681,A fortiori if it were a gun in plain view.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2188.681,2189.939,"Excuse me, Mr. Justice?"
1975.75-76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.939,2191.784,A fortiori if it were gun in plain view.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2191.784,2194.93,"Yes, yes."
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2290.162,2297.981,(Inaudible) that in a decision on precisely that point or did they just announce it incidentally in this case?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2297.981,2300.596,This was announced incidentally in this case.
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2336.471,2343.798,An Officer or Municipality might have to go all the way to the Supreme Court as this case now demonstrates to get that decided.
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2353.363,2363.943,"This is a matter of statute also. Certainly, there are maybe some questions as the statutory interpretation, but I think the statute in this case is quite clear."
1975.75-76,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.096,2403.112,"Mr. Ulrich, what if you win here and the South Dakota legislature decides it does not like the result very much, and so if passes a statute saying that policeman impounding car shall be subject to the highest degree of care."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2406.528,2414.206,"No, I do not believe it should but it if may go to an analysis of motive, what the Officer’s motive was when he entered the automobile."
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2435.028,2437.899,What else is there in the record to give you a motive?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2437.899,2438.845,Excuse me Mr. Justice?
1975.75-76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2438.845,2443.471,What else is there in the record to give you a contrary motive on behalf of the police?
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2443.471,2447.272,There is nothing in the record to give me a contrary motive.
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2447.272,2460.68,"The only thing that will be deterred, the only conduct that will be deterred if the case were decided your way, would be inventorying contents of cars."
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2460.68,2462.326,That would be correct.
1975.75-76,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2463.695,2471.337,"Be deterring constitutional violations, but simply here --"
1975.75-76,1,40658,robert_c_ulrich,,2471.337,2481.302,"It would be deterring constitutional violations because in my argument, and entry under the closed confines of the automobile and the console would be a breach of --"
1975.75-76,2,45112,william_j_janklow,,2719.899,2723.591,Couple of things Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.75-76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.9,2845.466,Should you be able to -- should you be able to look under the floor mat Mr. Attorney General?
1975.75-76,2,45112,william_j_janklow,,2845.466,2850.736,"I would say yes, because I think anybody frankly -- people put their keys under the floor mat a lot of times."
1975.75-76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.437,2859.498,Under the floor mat on the back seat?
1975.75-76,2,45112,william_j_janklow,,2859.498,2862.034,"No, not under the floor mat in the back seat."
1975.75-76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2867.501,2869.097,How about in the trunk?
1975.75-76,2,45112,william_j_janklow,,2870.435,2872.393,"No, you do not parked the keys there but --"
1975.75-76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.393,2874.19,How about a lot of search on locked trunk?
1975.75-76,2,45112,william_j_janklow,,2874.19,2879.549,We think that that would be proper just because trunks are broken into just like glove boxes are broken into.
1975.75-76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.023,2922.544,Under the seats?
1975.75-76,2,45112,william_j_janklow,,2922.544,2924.654,"Looking under the seat, yes sir."
