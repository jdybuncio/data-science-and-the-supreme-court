1976.75-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.05,"Mr. Moore, I think you may proceed when you're ready."
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,6.05,9.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.032,319.554,Do you think Virginia and United States have the same view as to whether these vessels are foreign vessels or domestic vessels?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,319.554,323.533,For purposes of the documentation laws --
1976.75-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.533,325.85,"Well, for purposes of the Bartlett Act."
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,325.85,333.329,"For purposes of the Bartlett Act that the United States' position would perhaps be that they are U.S. vessels, the ones operated by Seacoast in this case."
1976.75-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.329,333.791,Yes.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,333.791,340.327,For purposes of Virginia's fishery's regulation which we contend is not reached by the documentation laws.
1976.75-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,347.545,355.534,"The United States looked at these ships as foreign vessels same as Virginia does, then the Bartlett Act would apply."
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,355.534,356.45,That's correct.
1976.75-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,356.45,359.809,And the -- the -- the Virginia law might be in some trouble then?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,359.809,361.265,That would be correct.
1976.75-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.265,368.593,So the United States and the Virginia have diametrically opposing views as to whether these ships are foreign vessels or not.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,368.593,369.002,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.031,373.098,"Well, you say they are foreign vessels."
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,373.098,377.975,We say they are U.S. flag vessels operated by foreign controlled corporations.
1976.75-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.975,378.541,Yes.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,378.541,408.123,"And that there are reasons to believe, very strong reasons that foreign controlled corporation can operate a United States flag vessel and deplete fisheries in the same manner that the foreign flag vessels have in fact depleted our fisheries and that is a rationale which underlies Virginia's view of the foreign control being the decisive factor in whether or not they should be allowed entry to state fisheries."
1976.75-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,408.123,411.585,You're -- you're pitching then on -- on ultimate control rather than --
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,411.585,412.685,That's right.
1976.75-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,412.685,414.598,-- than documentation.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,414.598,415.607,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.325,500.547,Does the -- you mean the statute place any limitation on the disposal of the -- of the catch?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,500.547,501.357,"No, it does not."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.357,503.253,You can sell them anywhere they want.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,503.253,503.808,That's correct.
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.87,552.406,Suppose -- well then -- as -- as suppose -- as suppose that -- that the United States have -- would have power to -- to control this matter and what do you say the -- the licensing -- the federal license entitled these vessels to do if anything?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,552.406,574.883,"The federal license was considered in Huron Portland Cement versus Detroit, and in that case, it was said that the federal vessel license is not preemptive of state fishery -- state abatement of air pollution laws, the Manchester and --"
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.883,576.151,"Yes, but I'm just asking you, what did this --"
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,576.151,576.921,-- as a practical matter.
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.921,582.62,What did this particular license -- this particular license was issued under statute which said what?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,582.62,587.638,Which said that a certain vessel shall be licensed for the fisheries.
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.638,606.355,"And -- and if it's a licensed -- is -- is this a correct statement or the correct quote, appellees' vessels have been enrolled and licensed and are therefore, “Deemed vessels of the United States, entitled to the privileges of vessels employed in the coasting trade or fisheries.”"
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,606.355,607.145,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.762,613.921,And you say that -- that isn't the federal license for fish?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,613.921,623.511,That's -- that's the license I assert gives the right to take fish in state waters and we contend of course that it does not give the right to take fish in state waters.
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,630.186,635.088,I know but let's assume we disagree with you on that.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,635.088,636.043,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.043,643.306,Well this is -- would you -- would you say that -- would you sat that this statute on its phase purports to give a license to fish?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,643.306,644.168,"No, sir."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.034,667.141,"Now, you're talking the Commerce Clause so now, I'm talking about what does statute on this phase purports to do?"
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,675.408,688.892,It could in the coastal zone in which the Federal Government has exclusive authority over fisheries between the area -- between three miles and 200 miles effective March 1 or three to 12 miles under present law.
1976.75-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,706.549,708.92,"You -- you then state, what do you mean, the three-mile inward?"
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,708.92,710.827,"Three miles inward, yes, sir."
1976.75-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.827,726.597,"Do you suppose that after the Tidelands Act, the Submerged Lands Act, Congress could come along and say, “We're -- we're exercising our exclusive jurisdiction to license people to drill for oil within the three-mile limit?”"
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,726.597,727.776,"I don't think they could, Your Honor."
1976.75-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,741.152,746.506,Do you think oil stands on any different footing than shellfish within those three-mile limits?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,746.506,747.7,We don't believe it does.
1976.75-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.486,755.059,And the shellfish matter doesn't cover all fisheries?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,759.254,759.71,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.836,826.715,Yes.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,826.715,828.311,And they treat those resources equally.
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.311,833.402,Well natural resources in the -- in the seabed?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,833.402,838.69,"And the waters, Your Honor, I believe it says as well."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.69,841.833,Do you think they granted ownership with the waters?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,841.833,842.532,I believe they did.
1976.75-1255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.219,885.831,"Mr. Moore, I want to be sure of one thing."
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,889.803,892.705,They have never fished Chesapeake Bay in the past.
1976.75-1255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.828,903.082,"In your -- to your knowledge, have they ever complained about this?"
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,903.082,905.209,Not until --
1976.75-1255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.209,909.111,Not until the new legislations come along and now -- and now they (Voice Overlap) --
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,909.111,910.0,That's correct.
1976.75-1255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,910.0,913.025,All right.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,913.025,931.163,We submit then that Submerged Lands Act confirms that the documentation laws do not confer a right to fish and reach only the vessel that states have a free and clear right to license their fisheries and determine who shall take the resources within their boundaries.
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.231,1442.439,Mr. Moore --
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,1442.439,1443.309,It is --
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.309,1449.428,-- is there anything on the record to indicate that Virginia does reserve the Menhaden for Virginia residence?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,1449.428,1451.022,(Inaudible)
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.022,1456.147,If it does that a -- a Canada resident after he gets a catch ship to Menhaden to New York or some place?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,1456.147,1457.416,"Yes, he may."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.636,1478.504,"Would it be any different if it were reserving the privilege of being an architect, say, to residence or privilege to the mining coal or anything else?"
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,1478.504,1479.803,"I -- I think it is, Your Honor."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.803,1480.856,What's the difference?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,1480.856,1486.206,There is a very unique situation with regard to fisheries as a natural resource.
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.47,1540.494,The purpose then is not to preserve the Menhaden but to pre -- preserve the laborer and the employment opportunities.
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,1541.255,1544.706,"Your Honor, this statute, we feel has a conservation purpose as well."
1976.75-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.259,1621.075,Could a state provide that nobody but resident show -- pick certain agricultural products?
1976.75-1255,0,32004,james_e_moore,,1629.734,1646.169,"I think -- I think in --in some sense, the same argument would apply if in fact the predominant practice of nonresident pickers was to come in, pick and leave without in fact any connection or economic benefit to the community."
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1857.189,1862.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1945.741,1950.791,Your case Mr. Loflin is there were no American stockholders?
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,1950.791,1953.148,"I think not -- I think not one bit, Your Honor."
1976.75-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1987.154,2000.247,"Then for the purposes of this case, if Saudi Arabia and all of the stock of the parent corporation, all the issues would be the same in your view?"
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2000.247,2023.663,"They would be if, Your Honor will bear in mind that to get where we are, we had to undergo the scrutiny of the Federal Government and that scrutiny has input from various interested bodies of the government including state, fisheries, maritime, NOAA, and as Mr. Moore pointed out, there are defense concepts that are built into these licensing and enrollment provision."
1976.75-1255,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.778,2150.418,"Mr. Loflin, record show how long Seacoast has been fishing in Chesapeake Bay."
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2150.418,2167.033,"The record shows that Seacoast through the years goes back to 1911 fishing on the East Coast and in Virginia waters, at one time, it had a Virginia sub -- subsidiary which qualified as a resident so that it could fish in the Chesapeake Bay."
1976.75-1255,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.044,2170.222,It was way back.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2170.222,2174.373,"It was back some time, but I believe within the last 15 years."
1976.75-1255,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2174.705,2182.815,But I thought you said a minute ago that you've been fishing all along and all of a sudden they decided to go against -- that's not true.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2182.815,2184.862,There are two fisheries we're talking about.
1976.75-1255,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2197.606,2198.8,I misunderstood you.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2211.325,2211.683,If --
1976.75-1255,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.683,2212.829,So that's not so.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2212.829,2213.979,Perhaps I was misunderstood.
1976.75-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.988,2322.871,"They never get very big, do they?"
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2322.871,2324.461,Up to about 14 to 15 inches.
1976.75-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.461,2325.658,Really?
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2325.658,2331.416,And some of them will live as long as 7 to 10 years although that's a bit unusual.
1976.75-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2331.416,2336.147,"Not if your class can help it, they will."
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2336.147,2347.093,"We've added no real limit to the fact -- to the contrary, we hope they thrive to prosper, multiply and we'd continue to have a fishery to work on, but we make out living capturing Menhaden, yes."
1976.75-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2361.23,2362.823,Near about this kind of size --
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2362.823,2364.804,That would be about right.
1976.75-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.358,2412.431,"Did your lawyer call on New Jersey Attorney General the same way your clients or your opponents, lawyers called under Virginia legislature?"
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2412.431,2413.325,Not to my knowledge.
1976.75-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.548,2424.264,Is the name used Seacoast in New Jersey.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2424.264,2427.504,The Smith Mill Company was one of the names used in New Jersey.
1976.75-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.504,2429.971,"That's the name, I knew it was."
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2429.971,2433.787,"Well, I think it was known by that name in Virginia one time also."
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.019,2523.597,"Mr. Loflin, can I interrupt to get one historical matter straight in my mind?"
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2528.056,2529.059,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.059,2537.976,That is one of the two statutes that prevents you from fishing both in Chesapeake Bay and on the inland -- on the -- in the within three-mile -- on the -- on the ocean.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2537.976,2541.382,The resident statute strictly speaking just applies to the Chesapeake Bay.
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.382,2545.084,"Well, the resident statute has no application to waters -- to the ocean waters?"
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2545.084,2545.987,That's correct.
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.987,2546.351,Alright.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2547.211,2552.787,"The other statute, the alienage or citizenship statute applies to Virginia waters wherever."
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2568.183,2578.198,"Well, the language of the statute is, the waters of the Commonwealth or the waters under its joint jurisdiction and I thought that perhaps included the ocean waters which you said does not."
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2578.198,2578.534,I know.
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.66,2586.81,I see.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2586.81,2598.677,"-- further delineates the area in question, but it is -- the residency statute is a Chesapeake Bay statute, the other statute will bar us entirely from any waters in Virginia."
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2598.677,2613.219,The -- the thing that is puzzling me is why this litigation got started if they just passed a new citizenship requirement applied only that wouldn't have affected you if you're -- but you're already barred because you did -- you couldn't go under the -- in to the Chesapeake even before the new statute.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2613.219,2616.697,"As a nonresident corporation, we could not go into the Chesapeake."
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.697,2617.145,Right.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2617.145,2620.773,But we were fishing along the marginal waters of the coast.
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.773,2629.574,"Right, and the fact that the non-citizen -- the citizenship requirement affects the marginal waters that's why you were suddenly -- your -- your business situation --"
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2629.574,2634.149,It's fair to say that that triggered this because that meant we were out of Virginia entirely.
1976.75-1255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.748,2645.645,And you wouldn't have been out of the entire Virginia area if that statute applied to the ocean waters but it doesn't.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2647.084,2647.442,That's right.
1976.75-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2850.07,2871.917,We will resume there at one o'clock then.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2879.833,2895.846,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, the part where we adjourned for lunch, I was just going to remark briefly on the subject of enrollment and licensing, these are two quite different concepts and I wanted to highlight them briefly."
1976.75-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.841,2923.905,"Mr. Loflin, do both enrollment and licensing come up under the same statute?"
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2923.905,2924.464,"Yes, basically the same thing."
1976.75-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.464,2927.444,That's the 1793 Act?
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2927.444,2929.632,I am not sure that they're both under that same section.
1976.75-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.632,2932.756,The old one --
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,2932.756,2934.847,"Yes, that's right."
1976.75-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3015.901,3020.63,"Well, no one is contending you didn't comply with the federal statute, are they?"
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,3020.63,3029.699,"I -- I go into it only to try and lay a foundation for claims, I will later make as to the consequences that flow from complying with the statute."
1976.75-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3039.551,3041.373,It's your half hour.
1976.75-1255,1,31427,john_j_loflin_jr,,3041.373,3046.611,We're into the enrollment phrase and let's say it's been determined that we are permitted to fly the American flag.
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3742.133,3746.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1255,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3806.148,3807.73,Of Virginia fishery?
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3807.73,3809.265,Of Virginia fishery.
1976.75-1255,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3809.265,3813.364,"Yes, but was it prompted by the Men -- Menhaden situation?"
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3813.364,3813.94,"No, sir."
1976.75-1255,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3849.128,3856.27,"In other words, the Seacoast and its competitors had nothing to do whatsoever with the new statute?"
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3856.27,3868.427,"The new statute is not directed to Seacoast, it's directed at this national problem which the federal level protection does not afford complete protection for the states nor has it been intended to."
1976.75-1255,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3868.741,3875.165,And Congress could take care of that by saying that no foreign corporations could operate.
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3875.165,3877.386,"It could, Your Honor, but it has not."
1976.75-1255,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3877.386,3881.823,So I mean your dire results don't have to happen.
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3881.823,3887.341,"If the Federal Government would act in the same way that Virginia has acted to protect its own fisheries, that's -- that's correct."
1976.75-1255,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3887.341,3889.263,"Well not same way, but some way."
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3889.263,3890.311,"Yes, that's correct."
1976.75-1255,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3890.311,3902.287,"Well, that's the way Congress acted with the 1916 amendments with the Shipping Act when the Germans were trying to buy a control of a great many American Bottoms, isn't it?Couldn't they do the same here?"
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3902.287,3903.419,They did in that case.
1976.75-1255,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3911.957,3919.839,"Mr. Moore, do you agree with your opponent's construction over the residency statute Section 60 applying only to -- to in -- inland waters and not to coastal waters?"
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3919.839,3922.239,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, that's correct."
1976.75-1255,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3930.276,3930.351,I see.
1976.75-1255,2,32004,james_e_moore,,3930.351,3931.181,and Virginia.
1976.75-1255,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3942.15,3942.849,Thank you gentlemen.
