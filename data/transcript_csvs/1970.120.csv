1970.120,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,39.963,43.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,56.001,56.961,Would you keep your voice slightly higher?
1970.120,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,56.961,59.263,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,134.362,139.787,You mean has changed in attitude or something over which he had no control?
1970.120,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,139.787,146.058,Yes Your Honor but the Second Circuit and other Circuits following the jury decision have called it crystallization of conscience.
1970.120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,161.695,173.179,"Well, is it – do they say in those cases that the circumstance was one over they hadn't approached or he had no control or the time or both?"
1970.120,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,173.179,179.402,"Well, it comes at a time which is after the order report for induction."
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.831,1458.088,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1685.721,1692.768,How has the selective service system as to regulations bring the ambiguity?
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.768,1695.728,I can’t answer that Your Honor.
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1704.501,1708.294,I say there’s no question as to its ambiguity?
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.294,1709.536,I can’t --
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1709.536,1715.467,Splits the circuit intramurally split between circuits
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1717.212,1746.903,"I do know that the selective service system is presently in the process of a complete overhaul of its regulations and hopefully this type of thing will be ultimately eliminated and I think also that you know, not just in this situation but in others, something that when you write it appears perfectly clear, you get a particular fact situation to apply it to and all of a sudden there’s an ambiguity you didn’t notice there when you were writing."
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1746.903,1749.866,"What was it made, the sentences are --"
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1749.866,1758.354,"Gearey was, the first Gearey case was 364 F.2d which would place it I suppose four or five years ago."
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1758.354,1762.081,(Inaudible)
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.081,1766.402,(Inaudible) was back in the 50s I think.
1970.120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1773.938,1776.697,"Mr. Rehnquist, may I ask you a question?"
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.104,1790.274,"Well, we think it’s an important factor in this case, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1970.120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1811.77,1816.545,"You know, perhaps you can straighten me out as to the DOD directive."
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.684,1858.838,"If read literally, I suppose it is."
1970.120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1872.065,1873.258,"Certainly, it doesn’t say that, does it?"
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.258,1879.753,"It doesn’t say it in so many words, no."
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1919.228,1920.518,"Well, it depends really."
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1960.171,1960.796,"Yes, and certainly if we --"
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1960.796,1962.066,Is that it?
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.066,1989.352,"If we treat him contrary to the way the regulation says we should treat him, you don’t need any further argument, I suppose, to conclude that we’re doing wrong by it but we say the regulation construed perfectly consistently with its language does cut off not just conscientious claims but any claim that maybe result from volition and of course before notice to report for induction, there are any number of things that one may do volitionally to obtain exemption."
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.882,2174.201,"Mr. Rehnquist, you don’t necessary do it now at all but I hope that you will before you finish your argument, state as clearly as you can if you can the Government’s position with respect to assuming the bonafides on this conscientious objector status just where and when can he assert the claim and how would it be processed?"
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.887,2181.498,"Yes, well, let me address it right now if I may."
1970.120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.472,2213.363,That would be before any combatant training or service?
1970.120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.363,2234.389,"My understanding is that as soon as that kind of a claim is made in the army, the man gets what is in effect a desk job in a situation where he is not further processed into the military system until there has been a disposition one way or the other of his claim."
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,2970.73,2971.922,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.665,2986.005,"By the way Mr. Halvonik, you’ll have an opportunity to submit any response in the way of commentary on the material that Mr. Rehnquist presented."
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,2986.005,3022.144,"Very good, let me -- if I can also just comment on some initial thoughts which is that these figures referred to post notice claims, again, the Government hasn’t made the distinction between dilatory claims and late maturing claims and the Government has continued throughout this litigation to ignore that distinction and apparently it has in gathering its statistics too, so they’re not very helpful, but the most remarkable thing I found about them was that California is a place where they have the largest number of these claims, California where Ehlert’s the law not New York where Gearey is the Law."
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3042.354,3054.893,Oh I gather the Government isn’t now claiming that a gentleman who doesn’t present his claim because it matured late isn’t going to get his claim heard.
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3054.893,3061.548,"Well, he’s not going to get it heard if he can’t submit to induction, the Government does admit to that."
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3061.548,3062.59,"Oh yes, oh yes."
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3062.59,3085.038,"And let me quote from footnote six in Malloy where this Court said, quoting approvingly from the Seventh Circuit decision, “A sincere claimant for conscientious objector status cannot turn to the habeas corpus remedy to challenge the legality of his classification because this religious belief prevents him from accepting induction under any circumstances.”"
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3087.972,3094.044,"While we’re talking about footnotes, I have a question about footnote 53 in your brief."
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3124.782,3125.922,That’s true.
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3141.604,3142.219,Which memorandum?
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3147.401,3148.574,That’s true.
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3148.574,3151.651,Any explanation for that?
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3151.651,3152.8,I can’t (Voice Overlap)
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3152.8,3154.731,Puzzled me very much and I just wondered --
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3154.731,3158.093,It puzzles me too and we just found it and included it but I don’t know.
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.093,3171.132,The California Selective Service apparently state wise is doing exactly what you say a selective service ought to do and it's doing it despite the decision of this case in the Ninth Circuit?
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3171.132,3171.712,That’s true.
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3171.712,3173.812,This California law that I knew about it.
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3173.812,3182.415,That’s the way we understand it but I have no explanation for it and I assume the local boards are following the directive but I can’t be absolutely sure.
1970.120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3299.701,3318.0,"I suppose if you prevailed in this case, the remaining issues and let’s go back on remand as to the validity of this claim both with respect to late maturation, sincerity, and etcetera."
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3318.0,3319.134,"Well, we have to go back to the board."
1970.120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.838,3327.291,"We wouldn’t decide any of those questions, I’m very sure."
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3327.291,3331.618,"ell, I should think that with the conviction ought to be reversed because he has made a prima facie claim, --"
1970.120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.618,3332.142,Yes.
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3332.142,3334.665,They ought to go back to the board right for determination but the --
1970.120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3334.665,3348.757,"The Government not in oral argument that I’ve heard but in its brief urges this of course that the conviction can be and should be affirmed even if we accept your procedural theory, your procedural and constitutional theory on the basis --"
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3348.757,3355.92,I agree with the Government that he has to make a prima facie claim where we disagree with the Government is that we think he has made the prima facie showing.
1970.120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.405,3392.209,Because of the atomic bomb?
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3392.209,3393.288,Because of the atomic bomb.
1970.120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.313,3404.698,"Thank you, Mr. Halvonik."
1970.120,2,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3404.698,3405.415,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3405.415,3407.04,Thank you Mr. Rehnquist.
