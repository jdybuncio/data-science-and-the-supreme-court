1995.94-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.487,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-1239, Fulton Corporation v. Janice Faulkner."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,9.872,13.891,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1995.94-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,89.689,100.014,"May I just ask you, it's really not discrimination against commerce as it's discrimination against those who own stock that... the company of which does business elsewhere."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,110.452,138.122,"--That's correct, Your Honor, just as in the very early case of I. M. Darnell Company, which in fact was the same corporation involved in the Darnell case, the company that receives logs shipped from another State and was taxed in that case differently from logs that it had received from the taxing State, while it might not have been the outside shipper of the logs, it suffered the first impact of discrimination."
1995.94-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,138.122,143.007,Was the tax on the ownership interest in the company the tax on the stock there?
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,143.007,144.625,The tax at issue here is the tax--
1995.94-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,144.625,145.075,"Here it is, yes."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,145.075,145.625,"--on stock, yes, sir."
1995.94-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,145.625,147.391,"It wasn't in that case though, was it?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,147.391,162.151,"Well, there it was a tax on logs which were owned by the in-State company, but we've had many cases before this Court where the party who was objecting before this Court was not the party dealing in interstate commerce but was just a local party who had dealt with someone who was in interstate commerce."
1995.94-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,162.151,175.394,"But have we squarely held that it would be impermissible to tax at a different rate the ownership in stock of a company that did its business in the State, as opposed to stock in a company that only did its business out of State?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,181.631,182.131,"Yes, sir."
1995.94-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,182.131,185.333,"And what is the closest case on that point, in your view?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,185.333,198.408,"The closest case to the facts in this case, I believe, is Westinghouse v. Tully, the 1984 decision of this Court written, I believe, by Justice Blackmun."
1995.94-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.523,252.894,The Court... are you saying the Court struck down the tax in Westinghouse v. Tully?
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,252.894,257.798,"--Yes, Your Honor, the Court struck down the tax on the shareholder, which was a franchise tax in that case."
1995.94-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,349.808,361.882,"Your theory of the penalty is the theory that, in effect, the investment will be siphoned out of interstate commerce and into investment in corporations that do business solely intrastate."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,361.882,362.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.699,369.971,"Is that argument affected by the fact that, by and large, the investment market is a national investment market?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,400.907,403.793,"Your Honor, it might be somewhat invested."
1995.94-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.743,466.783,"Why do you say that none of the other compensating facts cases involve any discrimination, discriminatory effect on interstate commerce?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,492.017,499.42,I don't think that sort of interstate luring by nontaxation is the type--
1995.94-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.42,503.641,"Oh, you can call it luring, but any difference in price is a luring."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,508.276,515.881,"--Well, up to this point, this Court's opinions in that type of case have... by my reading have looked to two types of discrimination."
1995.94-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.959,531.776,Okay.
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,531.776,545.801,"Then, as this Court discussed in the decision in Jefferson Lines, there needs to be a credit applied by this State... let's say North Carolina... for any sales tax paid to the other State from which the car was imported."
1995.94-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.955,552.222,Okay.
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,567.049,575.136,"Perhaps the response to your question would be a statement that was made in Armco v. Hardesty, which is a very important case to us."
1995.94-1239,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,610.876,619.747,"Now, in order to win, Mr. Cummings, I guess you would have to persuade us to overrule Darnell."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,619.747,623.385,"Your Honor, no."
1995.94-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.634,657.42,"Well, when you say embroider, you mean take it from the Indiana--"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,657.42,661.122,"Take it from the Indiana supreme court... I certainly will not add to that... yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.067,784.769,--Was capital stock a net or gross?
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,784.769,785.305,--Gross.
1995.94-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.84,790.307,"Yes, but if they had liabilities, did they subtract it?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,790.307,791.09,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.09,792.309,They subtracted liabilities.
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,792.309,793.309,Correct.
1995.94-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.309,809.335,"So therefore in almost every case the gross... if there's goodwill in the company, and unless in an unusual circumstance except for that, then the value of the... the total value of the stock will be greater than the intangible or tangible property... the tangible property."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,809.335,811.271,That was my--
1995.94-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.271,815.072,"So almost every case, what they're really paying tax on in the corporation is the stock."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,815.072,816.09,"--Is the stock, right."
1995.94-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,829.232,855.382,"If we don't look any further than what Justice Holmes wrote, wouldn't it be simpler to say that what Holmes was, and what the Court was holding in that case was really something about equal protection in judging economic regulation, and the one thing that is clear today is that that is not the standard for dormant Commerce Clause taxation and let it go at that?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,855.382,858.584,"I'm with you all the way, Justice."
1995.94-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.984,862.219,"But I mean, it really could be--"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,862.219,863.003,It really could be--
1995.94-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,863.003,864.355,"--looked at as simply as that, couldn't it?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,864.355,865.555,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.495,905.863,"Well, what did the Court say it was deciding in Darnell?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,905.863,916.337,"--It said it was deciding, Your Honor, whether a State can tax the property of a domestic corporation, that property including the capital value of its stock, in the stock of a foreign corporation."
1995.94-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.337,918.337,"Yes, but it didn't say that in the abstract."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,928.562,948.809,"The citation follow... well, the Court said at the outset of the opinion that there had been a claim made under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the Commerce Clause, but when it got to the last paragraph, where it discussed the stock tax on in and out-of-State corporations, it cited the case of Kidd v. Alabama, which was a 1903 decision that was purely under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1995.94-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,967.603,969.722,"Well, but that's not equal protection, even Fourteenth Amendment."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,971.122,972.424,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,975.976,979.328,"Well, did it... is there any mention of equal protection in the opinion?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,979.328,982.88,"There's a mention of ""substantial equality""."
1995.94-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.812,1016.284,"Do you think we follow that approach today, that is, evaluate the tax just on the basis of how it applies to the particular petitioner before the Court and not how it applies overall?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1016.284,1017.636,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.636,1020.488,"I don't know that we've done that in the cases since I've been sitting here, anyway."
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1031.38,1041.835,"Well, I believe... yes, Your Honor, and I believe a straw has already been put into the wind on that issue in the Jefferson Lines decision earlier this year."
1995.94-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1153.925,1169.684,Is it your position that there is no tax that a State can constitutionally impose on the in-State shareholders of an out-of-State operating corporation?
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1174.088,1176.024,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.59,1185.546,What tax could a State impose on the shares that its taxpayers hold in corporations acting out of State?
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1185.546,1193.2,--We have no objection to a tax on 100 percent of the value of stock in an out-of-State corporation.
1995.94-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1193.2,1193.569,"All stock, so if they didn't--"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1193.569,1201.155,"A hundred... if the State of North Carolina wants to tax 100 percent of the value of all the stock owned by everybody, that suits us fine, because--"
1995.94-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1201.155,1203.507,--But nothing singularly.
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1225.671,1250.738,"--I would not think so, Your Honor, and that question is somewhat similar to the question that was raised recently in the Perini case from Massachusetts involving the distinction between how you were going to give a franchise tax relief for in-State and out-of-State corporations, and the Massachusetts supreme court held for the taxpayer and this Court did not issue certiorari, my closest analogy in a recent case."
1995.94-1239,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1250.738,1255.976,"--Well, has North Carolina repealed this tax--"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1255.976,1257.126,Yes--
1995.94-1239,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1257.126,1258.092,--do I understand?
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1258.092,1258.678,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1258.678,1262.88,"How many other States have a similar scheme, do you know?"
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1262.88,1264.03,At least four.
1995.94-1239,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1264.03,1266.248,And what would they be?
1995.94-1239,0,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,1266.248,1268.2,One is Kentucky.
1995.94-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1277.073,1299.153,"The same... I mean, I... just perhaps following up on Justice O'Connor's question, I suppose your reasoning here is going to be equally applicable when we're talking about related taxes on different taxpayers who are themselves related not as shareholder in corporations but as debtor and creditor."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1612.706,1615.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1239,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.294,1619.677,Yes.
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1629.335,1641.31,"My understanding, Your Honor, is that there is a list of stocks that's maintained by the State, and he can determine that simply by looking to that list to determine which percentage of the stock is taxable, so I think it's a fairly routine and easy mechanical matter."
1995.94-1239,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.32,1686.921,"Why don't you slow down a little bit, Mr. Rothfeld."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1686.921,1687.289,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.666,1758.451,Why didn't you do the same thing with the whiskey tax?
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1758.451,1759.387,"Well, I--"
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1759.387,1761.839,"I mean, people out of State don't pay the whiskey tax--"
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1761.839,1762.605,"--Well, I think--"
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1762.605,1764.155,--and foreign corporations don't pay tolls.
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1776.062,1784.085,"--Well, I think what you say is right, Your Honor, but I think that the State's view... and I'll suggest in a minute the State's view is clearly supported by the decision in Darnell."
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.88,1821.46,"I... you're saying that the ones that do business in North Carolina pay an income tax to North Carolina, and what you're trying to do is make up for the fact that the people who don't do business in North Carolina, unfortunately North Carolina will lose that income for the income tax."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1821.46,1822.343,"--Well, I think--"
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1822.343,1825.845,"And the problem that I have with that is not the technical thing, it's just the practical thing."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1849.995,1856.648,"--I think the difference, Your Honor, is that there is something in the State that's taxable, and that's the corporate shares, and the corporate shares represent something."
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.587,1866.237,Let me try once more.
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1885.584,1886.168,"--Yes, I--"
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.168,1889.786,"--if I accept your principle, wouldn't I also have to accept that?"
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1889.786,1891.954,"--I think clearly not, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1891.954,1892.404,Because.
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1925.143,1925.793,"Well, we--"
1995.94-1239,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.793,1926.828,--which you know you can't do--
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1926.828,1927.295,--We clearly--
1995.94-1239,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1927.295,1930.78,--and why does that not point to the problem in this case?
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1930.78,1933.148,"--Well, I think that leads us to the compensatory tax analysis here."
1995.94-1239,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1934.064,1941.052,You're saying compensatory tax analysis in effect can supplant the rule that requires an apportionment of income.
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1941.052,1942.42,"--Well, I--"
1995.94-1239,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1942.42,1942.987,I think that's what you're saying.
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1942.987,1943.937,--I don't think so.
1995.94-1239,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1945.789,1947.022,"Well, that's going to be the effect of it, isn't it?"
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1947.022,1948.324,--I don't--
1995.94-1239,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1948.324,1949.858,"That's the effect of your theory, isn't it?"
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1949.858,1951.61,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1995.94-1239,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1952.493,1975.975,"You're saying the intangible stock is in effect a surrogate for income, and therefore the two may be considered in relation to each other in determining what I should tax, and if, in fact, there is this surrogate relationship, and you are justified in taxing the one, you would be justified, I suppose, in taxing 100 percent of the income even though 80 percent of it was earned out of the State."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1975.975,1986.699,"--Well, we certainly recognize that the State can't tax 100 percent of the income, or any of the income which is earned outside of the State, unless the State has apportionable taxing nexus to it, and we're not trying to tax the income."
1995.94-1239,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.359,2064.283,"Mr. Rothfeld, the Kentucky supreme court recently dealt with this matter, and as I understand its decision, it rejected your argument up until the last step."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2096.17,2102.991,"Well, I'm not sure that I agree with everything in the opinion of the Kentucky supreme court in that case, although the Kentucky tax was a different tax than this tax."
1995.94-1239,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2148.472,2151.924,"I do find it cryptic, so maybe you can explain it to me."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2151.924,2188.014,"As I understand it, and perhaps I'm missing the crypticism there, but as I understand it, what was happening in Darnell was that there was a tax on real and tangible property that was imposed on corporations, and there was an intangibles tax imposed on the value of all corporate shares in the State, and insofar as the State paid intangible... insofar as the corporation paid tax on its tangible and personal property in the State, then the taxpayer was relieved, the individual shareholder was relieved of paying a shares tax, just as there is relief here for the individual shareholder if the corporation pays income tax."
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.976,2207.178,"Well, why are they any more related than whiskey is related?"
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2217.034,2224.52,"Well, I think the best I can do... perhaps I can't satisfy you completely, Your Honor, but the best I can do is that the share is a representation of something else."
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.805,2235.995,"It's a discounted value of a future income stream, and some of that income stream will be taxed when it reaches a North Carolina person, and the other is taxed in the form of an income tax."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2235.995,2236.863,And--
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.863,2239.38,"And North Carolina gets its share of that, and the others get their--"
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2239.38,2241.482,"--Well, I think--"
1995.94-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.482,2242.132,"--I mean, I agree that's what it represents."
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2242.767,2257.36,"--Well, and our analysis is that taxing both the representation of the income stream and taxing the income stream is in a sense a kind of duplicative taxation, and... because one is a representation of the value, the other is the value itself."
1995.94-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.812,2266.799,--Do you agree with Darnell that the shares represent property?
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2266.799,2269.834,"Well, in a sense... I mean, when you look at the shares of--"
1995.94-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.834,2270.884,I don't think anybody--
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2270.884,2272.453,"--No, I think--"
1995.94-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.453,2280.19,--any moderately sophisticated stock analyst would value shares on the basis of book--
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2280.19,2281.309,--I think that's right.
1995.94-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.809,2282.692,--So Darnell must be wrong.
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2282.692,2291.432,"--Well, I think this case is a stronger case for the State than Darnell, because as you say, clearly investors understand shares as representing a portion of income."
1995.94-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.52,2305.924,"Mr. Rothfeld, how many cases have we had that have approved compensating taxes?"
1995.94-1239,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2308.809,2312.411,There have been very few decisions of this Court involving compensating taxes at all.
1995.94-1239,2,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,3163.196,3182.442,"If this Court finds for Fulton Corporation, I would request that the Court in its decision give some indication of the application of its decision to the 1990 tax year issue."
1995.94-1239,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.664,3220.567,"Yes, but is it not clear that they have an alternative, either doing away with the exemption or doing away with the tax?"
1995.94-1239,2,29650,jasper_l_cummings_jr,,3225.369,3226.638,"--I agree, yes--"
