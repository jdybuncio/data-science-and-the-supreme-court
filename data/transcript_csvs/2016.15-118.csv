2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.895,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-118, Hernandez v. Mesa. Mr. Hilliard."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,6.895,49.705,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 15-year-old Sergio Hernandez was standing in Mexico, barely across the border, unthreatening and unarmed, when he was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent standing inside the United States. This tragic case is one of the most simplest extraterritorial cases this Court will ever have in front of it for five reasons. First, all of the conduct of the domestic police officer happened inside the United States. Second, it was a civilian domestic police officer. Third it was a civilian plaintiff, not an enemy combatant."
2016.15-118,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,60.685,78.385,"So is that -- I was trying to figure out from your brief what exactly your rule is. So are all five of those necessary, in your view, for there to be a Bivens claim? Is anything else necessary? Is that exactly the rule that you want us to adopt?"
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,78.385,103.83,"Justice Kagan, the rule that we're asking this Court to adopt to avoid the anomalous result, when a U.S. domestic officer on U.S. soil shoots and there's no constitutional constraints, is that when there is a cross-border shooting involving a Federal law enforcement officer on U.S. soil, and the resulting injury is in close proximity, then Fourth Amendment constraints on that officer should apply. And --"
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,103.83,108.88,"Well, that's a -- that's a test that, surprisingly, fits the exact facts of your case. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,108.88,113.76,It seems to me that the principles you're arguing for can't be so narrowly confined.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,129.88,134.94,"Chief Justice, if it was a drone strike, I'm assuming that it was -- it was probably military."
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,139.415,148.52,"So if this were, in your case, somebody from the -- the State National Guard or whatever, then it'd be a different result?"
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,148.52,154.74,"Well, if it was a State National Guard, I'm not sure that they would be shooting across the border, Your Honor."
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,154.95,164.89,"Well, you can imagine a situation that is not precisely like the facts of your case where military officials may be involved."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,164.89,182.11,"I can imagine that scenario, but that's not the purpose or the intent of this rule. The purpose of intent -- and intent of our rule is simply to involve this Court in addressing an ongoing domestic routine law enforcement issue along our southwest border."
2016.15-118,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.11,182.47,Your --
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,182.47,182.8,So the --
2016.15-118,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.8,199.26,"Your brief -- your brief excluded military personnel and intelligence personnel. Your -- your brief is limited to, as you said, civilian border patrol officers."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,207.435,209.94,"That's right, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,211.29,219.76,"Well, I understand that, but I'm trying to see what the logic is, other than yours happened to involve a nonmilitary actor and my hypothetical involves a military actor."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,236.3,247.16,Our theory is meant to -- to address the ongoing problem along the southwest border that has resulted in at least ten cross-border shootings and six Mexican national deaths.
2016.15-118,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,271.36,271.73,I mean --
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,271.73,272.72,But that isn't the question.
2016.15-118,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,272.72,273.05,I suppose the --
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,273.05,273.305,No.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,351.47,358.09,"Justice Breyer, this -- this world does not involve a drone strike, and I do not intend to suggest that it should."
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,359.53,361.375,We know that part.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,372.459,379.69,"Again, so the -- the rule that we are suggesting has a close proximity element to it."
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,388.87,390.33,"I mean, we can take --"
2016.15-118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,390.33,390.84,Perhaps --
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,390.84,400.79,-- your test point by point and -- and ask you whether it would apply in a situation where each of those factors was a little bit different. So the -- your client was 15.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,403.709,407.3,"No, Justice Alito, of course it wouldn't be different."
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,407.91,409.97,So the rule would apply there.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,409.97,415.46,"The rule would apply if he was 19, standing unarmed in Mexico, when he was shot."
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,415.46,415.84,All right.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,420.24,423.15,"Again, we're not asking for a win here."
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,431.0,437.44,"What if he wasn't in this culvert, but he was 200 yards beyond in Mexico."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,438.585,444.19,It may be under the Boumediene element of nature of the site.
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,458.015,469.88,"And what if the officer was not standing in the United States, but actually ran a short distance across the border into Mexico? That would seem to be worse, wouldn't it? But would you say the rule would be different there?"
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,469.88,478.6,"Justice Alito, it may be because the -- first, the Border Patrol agents are strictly prohibited from crossing the border, like federales are strictly prohibited from --"
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.6,478.8,Right.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,480.87,481.05,Well --
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,481.05,483.34,-- crosses into Mexico and then he shoots the --
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,483.34,483.66,Right.
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,483.66,485.055,-- the Mexican nationals.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,485.055,485.54,Right.
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,516.86,517.89,"No, I understand that."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,572.845,574.195,"Justice Alito, no."
2016.15-118,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,598.97,600.77,"Mr. Hilliard, if --"
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,600.77,608.525,"Well, your rule would be the same if this was the first time it happened, if it was one person and the other facts were the same; right?"
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,608.525,617.38,"My rule may be the same, but my response to the question wouldn't have as much meat on it because we're here after many of these shootings have occurred."
2016.15-118,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,629.905,632.72,What do -- an anterior question.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,648.895,665.32,"Well, I think that the Boumediene made clear, Justice Ginsburg, that aliens abroad have constitutional rights, depending on whether or not there is a -- after the evaluation, whether functionally, the Constitution should apply."
2016.15-118,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.0,669.045,But that was dealing with habeas.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,669.045,691.6,"That was dealing with habeas. But the Boumediene court did a full survey of the entirety of the extraterritory -- extraterritory cases, and they said there's a common thread. Now, what this Court does is it looks at, where are we sending this -- where are we sending the Constitution and what are we asking it to do? And I acknowledge and recognize and this Court has already said it's not a worldwide Constitution."
2016.15-118,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,698.745,703.31,I think you said what your rule is in a pretty clear way.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,725.305,736.475,"Justice Kagan, the reason that's our rule is because the interaction at the border, at our southwest border, has -- has resulted often in shots being fired across the border."
2016.15-118,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,739.155,743.55,"Well, I guess you keep saying that, Mr. Hilliard, that there's a problem here, and I respect that."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,771.425,808.655,"So using the -- the framework of Boumediene and the factors in Boumediene, and given that this fact pattern is unique to the case we're here about today, but not unique to the situation on the border, yeah, the Boumediene factors are -- are used to plug in the rule that we're asking for. For example, the -- the Boumediene factors are nature of the site, status of the person seeking the constitutional protection, importance of the right."
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,827.39,835.82,"Well, but the one obvious difference with Boumediene is in there, you were dealing with an area subject to an exclusive control of the United States."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,839.915,843.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would -- I would acknowledge that you're right."
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,875.2,876.85,"Well, but just to stop you there."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,888.96,890.28,"No, it does not."
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,890.28,894.23,It's because the injury occurs in a different jurisdiction; right?
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,894.23,897.4,It's because the injury occurs in close -- close proximity.
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,907.29,909.46,"Well, I assume that's true of a lot of borders."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,909.46,918.015,Well -- and the reason that that's important in regards to the truth of that statement is because the United States exercises some degree of control into the culvert.
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,923.25,926.72,Does the government of -- of Mexico agree with that?
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,926.72,934.29,The government of Mexico agree -- agrees that their sovereign is violated when the United States shoots bullets into their land and kills their citizens.
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,934.29,941.055,The question is whether the government of Mexico agrees with your statement that the jurisdiction of the United States extends beyond the Mexican border.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,941.055,954.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, at -- it was not that the jurisdiction extends beyond the border. It's that the control projects from our physical border as Michael Fisher, the head of Border Patrol said, outward."
2016.15-118,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,968.76,999.655,"May I ask about an anomaly created by your rule? I take it everybody agrees that if there were a Texas State trooper who was involved in the exact same conduct, that trooper, you -- you would not be able to sue that trooper. So why is it that Bivens, which is usually thought of as a more limited remedy than 1983, I mean, why should you have this situation where you can sue the Federal agent, but not the State agent?"
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,999.655,1006.06,"Justice Kagan, in all respects, except where the victim lie, this is a typical Bivens case."
2016.15-118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1024.41,1042.08,"Well, my -- I -- I -- I've waited while the rule was being discussed because that's important; but as Justice Kagan's question indicates, whether or not there can and should be a Bivens action is critical to your case. Since 1988, this Court has not recognized a single Bivens action."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1072.375,1076.78,"Justice Kennedy, there is no alternative remedy for the family."
2016.15-118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.61,1084.98,But that -- that means it's a critical area of foreign affairs.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1084.98,1091.55,We're not attacking the policy of the United States government in regards to Mexico.
2016.15-118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1098.62,1114.41,"Well, the policy of the United States, I suppose we can ask them if they're not going to give any compensation from a special bill for Congress or it might be picked up by an executor agreement, the policy of the United States is that this injury, a serious injury, goes unaddressed."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1143.125,1157.055,"Justice Kennedy, I would say it is an urgent matter of separation of powers, but it would be the opposite. The -- the fact pattern, if the Court may recall, is Officer Mason had actually grabbed one of Sergio's friends and had him by the scruff of the collar next to him in the United States."
2016.15-118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.76,1191.025,"So, Mr. Hilliard, you want me to put down in my notes the location of the boy is irrelevant to this case."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1193.91,1235.52,"You start with -- you start in your opinion that the -- that if all of the conduct happens inside the United States and -- and there's a close proximity cross-border shooting, then the Fourth Amendment -- Fourth Amendment constraints on deadly force apply. To -- to hold otherwise, Justice Kennedy, is -- is to prevent Bivens in the area of the border, whether it's south or north of the line, because if it -- if national security and foreign relations is affected 30 feet across the line and the -- and an officer stands in the same place and shoots Sergio's friend right next to him, then you have one kind -- one Bivens case and one non-Bivens case."
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1235.52,1246.59,"When I write the reason for that, I write the opinion just as you said it, and it says, but if it's only 30 feet away, the victim, then the Bivens action in the Fourth Amendment apply."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1272.485,1280.89,"My point is the -- the close proximity takes it away from your analogy, Justice Breyer. My -- my point is that if all the conduct --"
2016.15-118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1280.89,1284.355,That isn't a reason you normally can give in the opinion.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1301.75,1314.64,"If I understand your question -- question, Justice Breyer, the reason that Bivens should be allowed if all of the conduct happens in the United States, is -- is because the -- the anomalous --"
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1314.64,1317.885,"Well, all the conduct happens in the United States with the drones."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1317.885,1318.52,Right.
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.775,1327.235,Same with the drones.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1327.235,1336.37,"There's a Bivens claim -- if -- it's -- if -- with all due respect, it's not the same with the drones because there is no proximity and there's no cross-border shooting."
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1339.36,1339.52,Okay.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1373.25,1373.61,Hidalgo?
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1373.61,1374.46,"Hidalgo, yes."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1407.16,1417.61,"I -- I think, Justice Breyer, I -- and I -- if I get -- get your question in, in the middle of the river, according to the Treaty of Hidalgo is the -- the -- the deepest trench of the middle of the river."
2016.15-118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1421.385,1437.07,"We are responsible for maintaining it, not by ourselves, but with Mexico and the reason we are maintaining it is because at one time the whole river and now the line down the center are the boundary, and we don't want the river to jump its banks and create new boundaries."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1449.495,1460.42,So the curtilage cases were used in order to show that there is a -- a substantive reasonableness evaluation in -- in regards to the close proximity requirement of our rule.
2016.15-118,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1460.42,1480.68,"Are you -- are you relying at all -- I -- I'm not sure you did in your brief -- but there in -- in tort law, generally, when there's an act outside that causes injury inside, the regulating rule can come from the place where the conduct occurred."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1502.04,1504.35,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1550.69,1563.685,"Could I ask you to go back to Justice Kagan's question? If the -- if the officer here was a State or a local officer, would you be able to file a claim for damages in the United States in a Federal court?"
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1563.685,1582.84,"The issue in that regard is if -- what does ""jurisdiction"" mean under 1983? And if jurisdiction -- if you're not a citizen and you're not in the jurisdiction, are you precluded under 1983? The -- the point I was trying to make for Justice Breyer is there is some issue of control in the culvert, and it's -- it's never been decided what jurisdiction is in regards to --"
2016.15-118,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1582.84,1586.505,"Oh, well, put that aside. Let's assume this is in Mexico."
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1598.709,1607.895,"You would not have a claim over the State officer, but if you don't -- but a Bivens claim -- a constitutional Bivens claim could apply to the State officer."
2016.15-118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1608.85,1609.32,I'm sorry.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1648.745,1649.58,That's right.
2016.15-118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1649.58,1652.225,Personal general jurisdiction.
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1652.225,1655.42,"Justice Ginsburg -- I mean, excuse me -- Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-118,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1655.96,1661.12,That's the first time ever. (Laughter.)
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1661.12,1672.48,"I apologize. Justice Sotomayor, I agree with you, but the issue under 1983 is -- is citizenship and jurisdiction of -- of where it occurred."
2016.15-118,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1691.185,1702.94,How often do State officers act under cover of State law and outside -- with an impact outside the United States?
2016.15-118,0,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,1702.94,1705.44,"Justice Ginsburg, I've never heard of that."
2016.15-118,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1721.13,1728.055,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ortega."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1728.055,1743.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fourth Amendment does not apply in a cross-border shooting of a Mexican civilian on Mexico soil by a United States Federal agent. The Petitioners' claim for Fourth Amendment protection was answered in Verdugo."
2016.15-118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1747.32,1757.965,"In Verdugo, the U.S. officers were acting in collaboration with -- with the approval and cooperation of Mexican officers."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1760.265,1761.32,It is.
2016.15-118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1784.0,1795.12,But I thought in Verdugo the -- the question was a search that occurred wholly inside Mexico with the cooperation of the Mexican authorities.
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1795.12,1798.09,And this Court denied to extend that protection.
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.52,1859.445,"If Boumediene had control, who controlled the base? And here we know that this culvert, at least as far as paving it, keeping it up, spending many millions of dollars, seeing that trade, if it ever is filled with water, goes across and ships are free, et cetera, is a joint effort of Mexico and the United States."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1904.67,1912.24,"Your Honor, the culvert, if I may, is not an area where anybody plays."
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1914.96,1920.46,We'd have to take as a fact here that the children were playing.
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1926.8,1930.935,"The border in that area is still finite, Your Honor."
2016.15-118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1942.37,1955.24,"He was riding a bike in the culvert there, correct? The wall is on one side, he's on the Mexico side of the wall in the culvert riding his bicycle."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1956.935,1957.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1957.92,1966.064,And so the dividing line is just the overpass pillar?
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1966.064,1967.85,The dividing line --
2016.15-118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1967.85,1973.46,Was the boy at that pillar? The boy was at the pillar or behind it?
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1973.46,1976.125,The boy was at the pillar on the Mexican side --
2016.15-118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1976.125,1976.77,On the Mexican side.
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,1976.77,1978.44,"-- in Mexican territory. Yes, your Honor."
2016.15-118,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1978.44,1995.12,"The dividing line isn't even marked on the ground; isn't that right? You can't tell on the ground where Mexico ends and the United States begins. I think the point that Justice Breyer is making is this does seem like a very -- you know, it's a sui generous kind of case."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2023.135,2027.36,"It is very different, but it's the center of the culvert that's the dividing line."
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.36,2046.01,"We know from Boumediene that the word ""sovereign,"" and even the legal concept of sovereign, which in Boumediene belonged to Cuba, is not necessarily the line that distinguishes where the Fourth Amendment does or does not apply."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2046.01,2051.82,"But what was distinguishing in that case, Your Honor, is that we exercise control over Guantanamo --"
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.82,2052.05,Yes.
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2053.27,2053.45,-- at least --
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2053.45,2054.675,Absolutely right.
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2078.225,2083.88,But the United States does not exercise any de facto jurisdiction beyond the middle line --
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.88,2085.175,We do two things.
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2128.845,2153.13,"They would like it applied in this case, but they have never ceded any of their jurisdiction beyond the middle of the culvert. I understand that the maintenance of the culvert is a joint maintenance; however, the laws of the United States do not apply beyond the middle of the culvert."
2016.15-118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2153.13,2158.3,"But the law of the United States, the law is directed to an actor."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2213.14,2224.0,"And then I think it would be up to the United States to prosecute Mr. Mesa criminally if they were to choose -- choose to do so, which would provide a remedy to the Petitioners via a restitution --"
2016.15-118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2224.0,2224.35,Why?
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2224.35,2224.905,-- order.
2016.15-118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2224.905,2252.82,"They wouldn't get any damages for the death of their 15-year-old son for their emotional suffering. But I think I have, following up on what Justice Ginsburg is saying, a more fundamental question, which is I don't think you or the U.S. government is suggesting that anyone is condoning people standing at the border and taking potshots at passing Mexicans."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2252.82,2253.77,Absolutely not.
2016.15-118,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2253.77,2254.475,All right.
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2285.2,2286.365,It is shocking.
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.56,2296.64,No --
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2296.64,2296.73,-- it --
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.73,2300.84,It would be -- it would be -- and that's why we use their analogy.
2016.15-118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2357.01,2380.19,"But he has quite persuasive analogies in the law with curtilages, cannon shots, joint administration, and the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, which is to protect the people, we can say maybe American and maybe beyond, from unreasonable searches."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2397.514,2415.7,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that if -- even if the approach, if taken as framed by Your Honor were to be applied, it would still plunge the lower courts into a sea of uncertainty as to where that line actually ends."
2016.15-118,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2433.61,2435.7,"Well, Mr. Ortega, you say ""ad hoc,"" but --"
2016.15-118,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2435.7,2436.705,Justice Kennedy.
2016.15-118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2436.705,2440.44,Justice Ginsburg outlined all of the U.S. factors here.
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2459.01,2479.17,"The largest, or the most profound practical obstacle, I -- I believe, would be the application of the rule itself and not applying -- or not giving lower courts a clear certainty, a clear defined rule on which to apply --"
2016.15-118,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2479.17,2480.96,"Well, Mr. Ortega, the rule is very defined."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2499.7,2521.945,"But in areas of the United States that -- where there is a clearly defined border, as we have here, the Fourth Amendment stops unless the person seized -- in this case Hernandez -- had some voluntary contact with the United States."
2016.15-118,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2521.945,2534.105,"Could I ask you briefly, because we haven't talked about it yet, a question on the qualified immunity point. It seems very odd to me that qualified immunity would turn on a jurisdictional issue."
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2570.915,2575.45,"I don't know of any case that fits that fact pattern, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2575.45,2593.215,"Would you recognize that -- let's say it was the -- the boy that the Border Patrol grabbed and then shot him, so the -- the -- so the death would have occurred in the United States, Bivens claim?"
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2593.215,2594.57,"Well, absolutely."
2016.15-118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2599.28,2624.515,"So does it make a whole lot of sense to say if the officer shoots somebody on the U.S. side of the border, good Bivens claim? If the officer standing in the same place shoots somebody who's just across the border, no claim? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense, does it, to distinguish those two victims?"
2016.15-118,1,62813,randolph_j_ortega,,2624.515,2627.72,I think it's very distinguishable because of the very real border.
2016.15-118,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2632.645,2647.22,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2647.22,2656.87,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The antecedent question in this case is whether this Court should create a cause of action for damages under Bivens."
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2668.405,2682.695,"You're quite right, Mr. Kneedler, but there is a difference between this case and I think -- I think all -- maybe all but one -- of these other cases, which is in all of these others, the Court has been able to point to some alternative remedy."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2714.855,2722.86,"First of all, the Court has made clear in Stanley and Wilkie that the presence or absence of a remedy is not the only factor, that there is the additional --"
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2722.86,2726.61,"Well, we said that, but, you know, Stanley might be the only case on your side."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2739.87,2748.975,"Well, when you say Stanley and Chappell v. Wallace, ultimate special factors because of the political branches' control over the military."
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2787.02,2791.53,"That's the U.S. -- U.S. liability, not the officer liability."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2791.53,2813.66,"Well, but I -- but I think if the Court is considering whether to fashion a judicially created remedy, looking to what Congress has done where it has acted -- and 1983 is another very prime example -- and where Congress has chosen to create monetary compensation for persons injured abroad by the United States, it has always done it in an administrative --"
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.66,2839.605,"Well, why -- why -- why do you use words like ""create,"" ""extend,"" et cetera, ""fashion,"" if, in fact, a Federal policeman, a Federal agent violates the Fourth Amendment and seizes someone unreasonably in Alaska, does the victim have a Bivens remedy?"
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2839.605,2840.42,"Yes, but --"
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2840.42,2840.83,Of course.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2855.145,2856.79,"Yes, but there's --"
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.79,2856.92,Yes.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2857.33,2857.88,But there's something --
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2857.88,2859.56,"Now, let's see where I've gotten -- I'm trying to go somewhere with the question."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2859.56,2864.28,But -- but there's something fundamentally different about creating a Bivens remedy for --
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.28,2868.04,"Well, why creating? I would have thought if you want to say in there --"
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2868.04,2868.88,Or extend --
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2868.88,2869.31,Wait.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2934.115,2934.45,No.
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.78,2948.15,"Oh, yes."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2949.405,2955.7,"Well, no, in the -- under the Eighth Amendment, under -- in Carlson v. Green, the Court recognized a Bivens remedy against Federal employees that --"
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2955.7,2957.24,That's Eighth versus Fourth.
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.24,2958.66,I'm saying that's Fourth in Puerto Rico.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2958.66,2966.72,"No, I'm -- I'm -- what -- my point about the Eighth Amendment is that the Court declined to recognize a Bivens remedy for Eighth Amendment violations --"
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2966.72,2967.96,"Mr. Kneedler, you -- Mr Kneedler: -- for private confirmations."
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2967.96,2968.58,-- you get the point.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2984.34,2994.73,It is the heartland of Bivens' special factors analysis for the Court to create a damage remedy in a situation fraught with foreign relations issues.
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2997.01,2998.81,"Well, could you say -- let's talk about that."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3022.68,3023.04,Any -- any --
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3023.04,3024.53,The problem we would create --
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3024.53,3024.98,Any time --
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3024.98,3027.57,-- not just the fact that it has something to do with another country.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3027.57,3053.36,"Any time -- any time the officers of one country injure someone in another country, that creates the potential for a foreign relations incident and it's illustrated here by a number of factors. Mexico requested the extradition of -- of Mesa in this case, and the United States refused because it had done its own investigation of this incident and concluded that the -- that prosecution should not be brought --"
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3053.36,3055.83,I'm sure Mexico cared a lot about this.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3066.345,3082.62,"And another illustration, and I think -- I think it's tied to that is one of the reasons is that -- why there is not a remedy in Mexico is because Mexico would recognize the official immunity of Officer Mesa in this circumstance according to the amicus briefs."
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3111.945,3129.419,"But suppose -- suppose the -- the victim, the same -- the same location across the border, but were a U.S. citizen, as Justice Breyer mentioned, many -- and many transients will go -- go across from Juarez to El Paso."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3136.14,3141.66,We -- we think there would not be a Bivens remedy there either because of the extraterritorial applications.
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3141.66,3150.64,"And then if it were, if it were the young man who was grabbed by the Border Patrol guard and shot on the U.S. side, Bivens?"
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3150.64,3152.78,"Yes, there would be."
2016.15-118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3171.75,3173.0,If it -- but that's the point.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3224.21,3239.48,"Boumediene had to do with the -- the substantive application of the Fourth Amendment, which I want to get to in just a minute. But the antecedent question is whether this Court should answer those questions in a private damage remedy when it hasn't recognized a new context for one in 35 years."
2016.15-118,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3239.48,3240.7,"Well, what would the government --"
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3240.7,3241.57,If they're thinking -- think --
2016.15-118,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3241.57,3259.2,"What would the government of Mexico say if we wrote an opinion that says because the United States spent a lot of money to pave this culvert, we think that the United States' authority with respect to the culvert is basically the same as the authority that we have in Guantanamo."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3259.2,3261.95,I think the Mexican government would be very offended by it.
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3261.95,3264.13,I'm sure it wouldn't have to be written that way. (Laughter.)
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3264.13,3275.32,"This -- this case -- this -- no, but this -- this -- this case is -- this case is fundamentally different than Boumediene. In Boumediene, the Court said that the United States is not answerable to anyone else."
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3280.0,3280.13,How? How?
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3280.13,3280.42,Pardon?
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3280.42,3287.475,You did say in your brief the United States is answerable to Mexico for any cross-border use of force.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3292.675,3297.57,Mexico -- Mexico holds us accountable for doing something about it.
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3308.48,3312.975,The responsibility to Mexico is prosecution in the United States? That's --
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3312.975,3324.545,"To -- to control -- to control the conduct, yes. And -- and let me just reemphasize here. Where Congress has -- has decided the damage remedies are important, it has never provided for judicial remedies."
2016.15-118,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3328.66,3330.505,So you wanted to talk about the Fourth Amendment?
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3330.505,3331.095,Yes.
2016.15-118,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3360.52,3360.67,Can we --
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3360.67,3360.95,Does not --
2016.15-118,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3360.95,3363.285,-- go back to my hypothetical.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3385.8,3387.9,I have.
2016.15-118,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3387.9,3395.84,"I did, and I can't square the police officer's account of this incident with that film."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3395.84,3403.01,There were other videos. The -- the -- the press release -- nothing in the record and nothing in a -- in a public account --
2016.15-118,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3403.01,3403.25,That's fine.

2016.15-118,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3403.6,3404.16,I'm just curious.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3404.16,3410.09,-- there was other evidence and other video -- surveillance videos that were taken into account in the investigation.
2016.15-118,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3410.675,3431.99,Let me ask one other question. Are -- are there examples in the past ten years of the Congress of the United States passing special laws for -- to compensate victims for instances somewhat like this where the United States has either accidentally or deliberately transgressed on the rights of foreign persons?
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3431.99,3435.74,"I don't know if the -- if there have been private bills, but that would be the solution."
2016.15-118,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3439.38,3443.315,"Of course, I guess you could say that with reference to Bivens acts generally, even in the United States."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3443.315,3463.79,"Well, and this -- this Court, in deciding whether to apply Bivens, has -- has looked to the question of whether Congress is the right body to decide rather than the courts. And here we think it clearly is because of the foreign relations implications, not to mention the deeply-rooted presumption against extraterritoriality, all the more so in -- in with respect to this Court's creation --"
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3463.79,3464.03,As far --
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3464.03,3464.58,-- of a cause of action.
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3464.58,3478.32,"As foreign relations are concerned, at least a Justice of this Court has said that the behavior of our law enforcement agents abroad sends a powerful message about the rule of law to individuals everywhere."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3503.605,3509.55,"Well, Bivens has to do with a particular remedy and -- and who should create that remedy."
2016.15-118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3516.42,3517.46,"Yeah, but it doesn't happen."
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3518.09,3518.37,No.
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3537.42,3537.89,If the.
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3537.89,3538.28,And the --
2016.15-118,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3538.28,3549.89,"-- if the Border Patrol agent stood where he stood and took the shot he did, and the only difference was that the teenager in the culvert was an American citizen, is there a Bivens action?"
2016.15-118,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3549.89,3564.665,"We think there would not be, but that -- that's obviously a different question than -- than whether an alien should have a cause of action given 1983, and Congress's action in this area, which indicates a judicial remedy should not be available."
2016.15-118,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3564.665,3567.725,"Thank you, counsel. And, Mr. Hilliard, you have a minute left."
2016.15-118,3,62812,robert_c_hilliard,,3567.725,3584.43,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. To Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, both of my friends on the other side have now said there's a Bivens claim for the boy who shot next to the officer. Take that position into this hypothetical. The officer shoots the bullet -- shoots the gun."
2016.15-118,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3662.535,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
