1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.189,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-348, New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. the Council of the City of New Orleans."
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,12.141,12.974,Thank you.
1988.88-348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.903,185.186,"Mr. Lee, what if we had before us a state criminal case and the defendant raises, for example, a federal constitutional double jeopardy claim and says the state has no right to try him at all, and that issue would be completely dispositive of the state's right to try the case."
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,187.721,188.371,That is correct.
1988.88-348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.371,189.188,--in the federal court.
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,189.188,189.571,That is correct.
1988.88-348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.571,191.34,How is that different from your case?
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,191.34,206.532,"It is different in this crucial respect, Justice O'Connor, and the answer to that question is pivotal to this decision because I am well aware of the post-Younger cases that have involved that kind of constitutional challenge to a state proceeding."
1988.88-348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.58,255.198,I don't see how that fits--
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,259.317,271.125,"With a double jeopardy claim even so, there is still the possibility that the state court might be able to... depending on the circumstances of the case... that you might be able to have a narrow construction."
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.647,288.503,"Do you think a double jeopardy claim then... if there was no question of state law involved, a federal court should be able to intervene prior to trial?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,288.503,290.153,It would depend so much.
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.49,296.692,"Well, but you said just a minute ago it would come out the same way."
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,297.309,297.909,--In the event... yes.
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.679,304.096,"Well, what do you mean by--"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,304.096,304.829,--by the narrowing of the statute.
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.829,305.548,--What do you mean by mediation?
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,317.188,318.122,Well--
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.122,320.14,And I don't think any of the opinions say that.
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,320.14,332.698,"--Well, I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that that really is said in Moore v. Sims, perhaps most prominently, in Pennzoil, and in Trainor v. Hernandez."
1988.88-348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.019,442.419,Excuse me.
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,471.439,477.61,"--What we say, Justice Scalia, is almost that, but not quite."
1988.88-348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.187,525.24,"Well, Mr. Lee, there is no question, is there, that the Louisiana courts could decide that preemption issue?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,525.24,545.904,"There is absolutely no question about that, Justice O'Connor, and I think that that poses the issue very neatly because if the Fifth Circuit's judgment is upheld, then the rule for abstention cases will be that abstention is proper whenever a state court can decide the federal issue."
1988.88-348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,559.414,568.019,Do you contend that you were entitled to federal court intervention before the initial state hearing was concluded here?
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,568.019,568.536,Yes.
1988.88-348,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,630.76,641.249,"Well, under that analysis do we give any deference at all to the importance of allowing state procedural and adjudicatory mechanisms to operate?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,641.249,642.9,Of course we do.
1988.88-348,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.068,724.804,"Well, what is the preemption question were an open one?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,724.804,725.504,Then it would be harder.
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,741.731,744.216,"Well, then... but what's your position, Mr. Lee?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,758.876,770.183,"Basically the same one the Respondents are talking about and what most of the lower courts have said, which is that you make a preliminary assessment to determine... something like the quick-look doctrine in antitrust."
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,770.6,772.035,"--Well, how do you go about that?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,774.035,774.352,--Well... well--
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.352,775.154,--from the phrase.
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,775.154,776.704,--It is easy in this case.
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,794.633,796.485,"What does ""on its face"" mean?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,796.485,800.103,"--Well, whether... whether... perhaps ""on its face"" is not the right word."
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.492,811.16,"That's a very, very--"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,811.16,811.627,"--No, but--"
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.627,812.41,--nebulous test.
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,812.41,814.779,--But the courts of appeals have had no difficulty dealing with them.
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.779,817.514,"Well, we're in this Court."
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,817.514,818.114,I understand.
1988.88-348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.087,863.462,"Mr. Lee, you're saying it is not enough if the federal court satisfies itself that there is some state substantive interest involved outside of the adjudicatory interest?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,863.462,864.029,We're saying--
1988.88-348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.029,869.116,You have to weigh whatever state substantive interest there is against the federal preemption interest?
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,870.083,871.049,--That is correct.
1988.88-348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.731,898.033,"--Well, this one is easy, you say, if we adopt the test that's a hard test to apply."
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,912.46,913.026,"--Well, if you want to--"
1988.88-348,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.026,913.895,--by these balancing tests.
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,913.895,914.628,--Yes.
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,929.487,935.725,"Mr. Lee, what was the non-adjudicatory interest of the state in Younger v. Harris?"
1988.88-348,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,935.725,951.335,"Oh, it was in this narrowing... this narrowing construction that the state might be able to give to its own criminal syndicalism statutes and thereby mediate between state and federal interests."
1988.88-348,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.287,958.524,Mr. Lazarus.
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,958.524,958.824,Thank you.
1988.88-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,975.552,980.104,"Well, what is the state's non-adjudicatory interest in the double jeopardy case?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,980.104,983.806,--In the double jeopardy case you have an ongoing criminal prosecution.
1988.88-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,991.395,996.466,"So, if... but if the state proceeding had started before the federal, then this would come out differently?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,996.466,996.916,"--No, no."
1988.88-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.593,1019.747,"Well, but what is... what is the non-adjudicatory interest in the double jeopardy case?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1019.747,1023.033,In the ongoing enforcement of criminal laws in the state.
1988.88-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.033,1029.703,"Well, why doesn't the state have the same interest here in the ongoing processing of these state court actions?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1029.703,1035.457,"Because you have to look at each of the three state... the one, for instance, there is a NOPSI lawsuit against the City Council."
1988.88-348,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1152.818,1163.357,"Well, Mr. Lazarus, I thought Mr. Lee suggested in the criminal case I posed of the pure double jeopardy claim that maybe there shouldn't be abstention."
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1163.357,1167.594,--And I'm suggesting that there would be abstention because of the different nature of the proceedings.
1988.88-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.713,1179.668,I thought Younger and some of the other cases emphasized very heavily the fact that it was a criminal proceeding.
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1183.037,1183.453,--That's right.
1988.88-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.453,1185.055,--enforcing its criminal law.
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1185.055,1185.722,That's right.
1988.88-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1189.741,1195.078,"It's not true of Trainor against Hernandez, Moore against Sims, the Ohio Civil Rights case."
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1197.713,1201.732,--There are civil cases which the Court... where there are ongoing enforcement actions.
1988.88-348,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.053,1288.207,"--Now, how do you fit Pennzoil into this?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1288.207,1295.11,We Pennzoil we had an ongoing state proceeding and we had a state court that was enforcing a judgment against them.
1988.88-348,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.364,1302.647,You mean--
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1302.647,1309.37,"Here we had an ongoing state court proceeding, and the constitutionality of that was under challenge, an aspect of it."
1988.88-348,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.37,1321.528,"--You mean if the state court proceeding here had proceeded to the point where there was an order issued and then the federal court was asked to set aside that order, we'd be in the Pennzoil situation?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1321.528,1332.2,"Actually, we wouldn't be in the Pennzoil situation because still... I think it would be a very different case... but, still, there they would be basically challenging what the City Council had done."
1988.88-348,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.674,1439.838,"Does your argument assume, Mr. Lazarus, that we agree that there is no substance whatever to the... to the assertion that the utility here could have complied with the federal requirements of FERC and nonetheless done what the municipality here wanted it to do by reselling the power it was committed to take?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1439.838,1441.957,To the extent that I'm talking about Younger initially--
1988.88-348,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.957,1442.307,Yes.
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1442.307,1446.159,"--our initial argument, the necessary preceding argument is independent of that inquiry."
1988.88-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.959,1502.745,"Well, the federal issue could be decided in one or more of those cases."
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1502.745,1503.697,In the state court.
1988.88-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.78,1512.101,"Well, what if it's... what if you... what if the state court beats the federal court to the issue?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1512.101,1519.14,"--If the state court beat the federal court to the issue, then we might have a res judicata problem that we--"
1988.88-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.14,1520.273,"A rather severe one, wouldn't we?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1520.273,1521.659,--But we don't have here.
1988.88-348,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.659,1529.896,"But you're not... are you saying that the federal court should be able not only to deny abstention, but to enjoin the state proceedings?"
1988.88-348,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1529.896,1530.265,No.
1988.88-348,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.833,1537.252,"Thank you, Mr. Lazarus."
1988.88-348,2,20264,clinton_a_vince,,1546.357,1550.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-348,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1649.972,1654.375,Did they make that same finding as to the Agency?
1988.88-348,2,20264,clinton_a_vince,,1654.375,1655.375,Could you repeat the question.
1988.88-348,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1655.375,1659.696,"Did they make that same finding as to the Agency, the New Orleans Council?"
1988.88-348,2,20264,clinton_a_vince,,1662.315,1663.081,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.88-348,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1703.808,1726.572,"Well, if there is only the federal claim of preemption presented and there is no undecided issue of state law at all remaining... just make that assumption... then what is the comity based interest that says the federal court should abstain?"
1988.88-348,2,20264,clinton_a_vince,,1726.572,1733.577,"I think there would be three basic state interests, if I understand your assumption correctly."
1988.88-348,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1784.86,1787.896,"Well, you strayed from my assumptions in your response."
1988.88-348,2,20264,clinton_a_vince,,1799.437,1809.209,"Your Honor, if only the federal preemption claim remains, the state still needs to look at what the state regulator did and compare that to what the federal regulator did."
1988.88-348,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,2705.125,2706.841,"Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-348,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.579,2763.963,Excuse me.
1988.88-348,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,2767.615,2768.081,--That is correct.
1988.88-348,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.081,2769.733,--to decide whether it's clear or not?
1988.88-348,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,2769.733,2770.367,That is correct.
1988.88-348,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2770.367,2770.867,You're--
1988.88-348,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,2770.867,2771.4,That is correct.
1988.88-348,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.375,2781.975,--It was clearly wrong.
1988.88-348,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,2783.558,2783.91,That is correct.
1988.88-348,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.91,2786.426,It might still be right.
1988.88-348,3,39761,rex_e_lee,,2786.426,2788.412,That is correct.
1988.88-348,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.23,2868.947,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
