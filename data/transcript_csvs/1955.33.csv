1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,1669.915,1670.881,It does this much.

1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,1981.342,1985.987,That is the alleged primary dispute and my brother falls into this error.
1955.33,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2121.12,2124.643,Does that -- you say that doesn't come under --
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2124.643,2125.941,Section 7.
1955.33,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,2126.712,2127.974,That doesn't come under 8 (4)?

1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2381.301,2383.277,But not to -- haven't put on at all (Voice Overlap) --
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2383.277,2387.087,Not -- to limit -- to limit the number that could come into the yard.
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2387.087,2389.108,This was a way of doing it?
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2389.108,2399.145,It may have been an -- a technique but it was not the object because 8 (b) (4) requires that an object be the cessation of employment.
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2400.352,2407.962,"Maybe that's the way we construe it but 8 (b) (4) on its face and because of that construction and the Rice Milling case certainly, doesn't it?"
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2407.962,2412.276,"Your Honor, I have -- I defer to your superior analysis of the case."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2422.835,2425.969,You probably know that I'm most present during that phrase --
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2425.969,2426.188,"Yes, I know."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2426.188,2429.737,-- to cover up analysis before the job when the motion is done.
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2444.457,2451.8,"If there is every inducement of a strike, even a primary one has incidental secondary effects."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2463.569,2465.432,I'm not at this point.
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2519.752,2520.617,"That's true, Your Honor."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2572.809,2578.124,That is -- that is -- would you accept this in the phrasing of what you've said if I understand it.
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2591.223,2608.156,"Or -- or under Aircraft & Diesel versus Hirsch that an application to the Court would have been -- would have been futile and the damage irreparable because as I understand the case, Your Honors there said that one need not resort to an agency where an application would be futile and there would be irreparable harm."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2695.631,2706.009,"I -- I understood you to the answer to your brief, and that's the fighting ground and that's -- I don't -- if I may say so, I think they've got a right about substance, 8 (b) (4) doesn't apply then there's nothing to do."
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,2706.009,2706.854,Right.
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3147.095,3155.414,"That's of course, if you're right, and the only place which a railroad in this situation can go into the state court on the various case?"
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3155.414,3156.382,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3156.382,3158.073,You could go to the Railway Labor Board?
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3158.073,3165.192,"No, it can't but it will go to a federal court because there may not be a labor dispute and therefore the inhibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia won't apply."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3165.192,3167.83,"Well, if the Court, they're only -- supposedly this --"
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3167.83,3168.912,"On diversity, yes."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3169.849,3172.222,And do you think this should be out of Norris-LaGuardia?
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3172.222,3172.859,This one?
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3172.859,3173.604,Yes.
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3173.604,3174.614,This particular case?
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3174.614,3177.271,"No, no, I mean not this case."
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3177.271,3178.154,I don't follow Your Honor.
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3178.405,3181.519,It was exactly outside of the jurisdiction of Norris-LaGuardia?
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3181.519,3182.125,I think so.
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3182.925,3185.547,I won't get into that because I think that was the real test.
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3185.547,3186.606,A very interesting question.
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3218.299,3222.168,For Anheuser-Busch (Inaudible) It has a policy to --
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3222.168,3222.704,Your Honor --
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3222.704,3225.057,I'm not asking if you like it or not.
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3225.057,3238.424,"Yes, I think Anheuser-Busch doesn't mean that in every case in which there is an allegation of possible embracing of the activity within the four corners of the statute, you must send it back to the Board for determination."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3297.681,3300.543,Did Judge Wyzanski write an opinion in the original application?
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3300.543,3307.148,"This is very interesting, Judge Wyzanksi, I -- I didn't handle that complaint either because I thought it was a bad complaint."
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3332.772,3334.026,Did he write an opinion?
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3334.026,3334.954,"He did not, it was --"
1955.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3334.954,3335.552,Just oral?
1955.33,1,26529,herbert_burstein,,3335.552,3336.53,"-- oral opinion, yes."
1955.33,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3396.086,3401.589,"I think you have about three minutes, if you care to use them Mr. D'Arcy?"
1955.33,2,41247,stephen_j_darcy_jr,,3401.589,3410.163,I -- I should like to point out to the Court that enjoining and the motion as -- as my brother suggested to conform the pleadings to the proof.
1955.33,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3461.465,3474.664,Thank you.
