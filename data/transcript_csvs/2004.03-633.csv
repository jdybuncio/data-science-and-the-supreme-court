2004.03-633,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.339,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,9.166,12.239,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.983,94.903,"Well, we didn't leave it up to the States entirely."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,100.764,101.302,No.
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.871,105.1,So there's... there's some minimal level of mental retardation.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,105.366,106.481,--There is some minimal level.
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,106.481,111.766,"And isn't that necessarily over-inclusive, just as picking any single age is necessarily over-inclusive?"
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,111.766,111.932,No.
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.932,122.912,"Surely there will be some people who... who, although they have that level of mental retardation, with regard to the particular crime in question, are deserving of the death penalty."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,122.912,127.991,"I... I don't agree that it would be over-inclusive, given the Court's analysis in Atkins."
2004.03-633,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.481,151.23,But the age 18 is set even for such things as buying tobacco.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,174.886,180.459,"I think that legislators would be surprised, when they adopted those statutes, that they were affecting their criminal law."
2004.03-633,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,197.715,200.52,But with parental... they are wards of their parents.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,200.52,200.892,--Yes.
2004.03-633,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.892,202.832,So their parents... the same thing with marriage.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,207.085,219.633,"Although in most instances can marry if they go to a court and demonstrate they are sufficiently mature, again contemplating individualized determination, which the Missouri Supreme Court says does not exist as to 17-year-olds with regard to capital punishment."
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.633,221.491,Why pick... why pick on the death penalty?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,232.432,242.379,"Well, I... I must assume that if we... if the Court says they are immune from the... from capital punishment that someone will come and say they also must be immune from, for example, life without parole."
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.379,244.98,I'm sure that... I'm sure that would follow.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,247.542,247.952,No.
2004.03-633,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.035,260.954,But didn't... didn't we adopt a 16-year-old line in our earlier case?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,260.954,274.968,"In... in Thompson, the Court in a 4-1-4 decision struck a 15-year-old... a 15-year-old execution, and the States have taken, including Missouri through its General Assembly, have taken that to mean that there is a 16-year-old line."
2004.03-633,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.411,296.41,"Well, but... but there was... it's about the same consensus that existed in the retardation case."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,296.41,297.608,"--Absolutely, that's true."
2004.03-633,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.351,303.363,And... and so are we somehow required to at least look at that?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,314.592,318.695,--The... the Court has kind of three groups of cases with regard to the number of States.
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,347.302,349.326,"Well, we... we have a different kind of trend."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,390.936,392.134,"--Well, two things."
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,404.56,409.223,Has... has the... has the rate of attrition been the same?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,409.223,410.959,--It is--
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,410.959,412.035,13 to 2 is pretty spectacular.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,412.035,412.407,--It is not--
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,412.407,416.948,"I don't think we've seen that, or maybe we have seen that, for... for death imposition generally."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,417.486,428.093,"--It is certainly greater, but part of the problem is we're dealing with such small numbers for the... the juveniles, those under 18, that the difference of one or two makes a huge difference in how the numbers come out."
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,434.203,435.856,"Well, it went up once I think, didn't it?"
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,435.856,439.322,--It... it went up once within... since... since Stanford and then came back down.
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.23,455.48,So... so you're basically--
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,461.219,461.59,Right.
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.59,462.583,--to infer anything.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,462.583,465.117,"Right, and the time is too short on the legislative side as well."
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.676,498.703,"You... you were in the midst of telling us why the... there is a consensus now that it's inappropriate to execute anyone under 16, and I... I... you weren't--"
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,498.703,498.969,--No.
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.275,500.018,--You couldn't finish that answer.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,500.556,512.9,"--Since... since Stanford, we have had no executions under 16 even though it is possible to read Justice O'Connor's opinion in that case as allowing a State to adopt a statute that specifically says 15."
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.782,526.002,And... and so you say there's... there's not so much as a consensus as an understanding of what that decision means.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,526.002,527.272,I... I think that that's right.
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,543.209,544.34,Let... let me ask you this.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,562.732,567.107,I... I don't know how it could be anything but mitigating.
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.222,571.527,But that's not how the prosecution presented it to the jury.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,571.527,572.353,"--In that statement, but--"
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.353,576.523,He said... he... he almost made it aggravating.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,580.283,580.488,--No.
2004.03-633,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,617.102,618.217,It was pretty clear.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,632.706,639.848,"And if we were here because Mr. Simmons said that was improper and the Missouri Supreme Court said that was improper, well, we wouldn't be here."
2004.03-633,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,642.449,653.594,"But the question is, can... is... is age, youth inevitably mitigating, and here is a prosecutor giving the answer no, it can be aggravating."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,653.594,661.851,"The Missouri statute requires that an instruction be given that says that age is a mitigator, and the... the instruction was given here."
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.989,666.038,"Well, what's... what's the--"
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.038,666.864,"Well, that's somewhat--"
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.864,669.753,--What is the contrary of... of mitigating?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,670.846,672.127,"Aggravating, but aggravating--"
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.127,672.432,--Is it?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,674.001,676.313,"--Well, you're right, Your Honor, because--"
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.313,683.826,"Maybe the opposite of mitigating is aggravating, but it... it's perfectly good English to say, mitigating?"
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,684.448,684.752,--It is--
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.752,685.578,--It's not at all mitigating.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,685.578,686.138,--Yes.
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.51,688.012,So I don't know why you give that one away.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,688.012,693.175,"--Certainly aggravating circumstances are defined in the Missouri statute, and they were defined in the instructions."
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.608,698.309,--Let... let's focus on the word unusual.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,734.246,738.062,No more than if we were one of the very few countries that didn't do this.
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.448,752.468,Have the countries of the European Union abolished the death penalty by popular vote?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,752.468,754.697,"I don't know how they've done that, Your Honor."
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.697,758.207,I thought they did it by reason of a judgment of a court--
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,758.207,758.884,"Well, in fact--"
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.884,760.453,--which required all of them to abolish it.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,760.453,761.568,--I... I believe that--
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,761.568,767.678,And I thought that some of the public opinion polls in... in a number of the countries support the death penalty.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,767.678,772.22,--I believe that there are countries in Europe who abolish it because of their membership in the European Union--
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,772.22,774.821,I... I acknowledged that in... in my question.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,792.282,800.084,"--I... I can't concede that it does because it's unimaginable to me that we would be willing to accept the alternative, the flip side of that argument."
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,804.708,805.989,Is there... is there any on... on that?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,837.735,839.676,--Nothing that I have seen has suggested that--
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.676,839.893,So if Lincoln--
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,839.893,840.719,--one way or the other.
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,840.719,853.639,"--Abraham Lincoln used to study Blackstone and I think he thought that the Founding Fathers studied Blackstone, and all that happened in England was relevant, is there some special reason why what happens abroad would not be relevant here?"
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,854.094,854.26,There's a--
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.26,855.209,I'm not saying controlling.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,855.209,862.639,--There's a special reason why Blackstone would be relevant because that was the law from which they were operating when they put this language into the Constitution.
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.639,869.121,"Absolutely, and they, I guess, were looking at English practices, and would they have thought it was wrong to look abroad as a relevant feature?"
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,869.121,871.245,"And... and I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor."
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,871.245,877.932,Do we... do we ever take the position that what we do here should influence what people think elsewhere?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,877.932,881.381,"I... I have not seen that overtly in any of the Court's opinions, Your Honor."
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.381,881.919,You... you think--
2004.03-633,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,881.919,886.582,You... you thought that Mr. Jefferson thought that what we did here had no bearing on the rest of the world?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,886.582,888.44,"Oh, I... I think Mr. Jefferson thought that."
2004.03-633,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.696,907.759,"But did he not also say that to... to lead the world, we would have to show a decent respect for the opinions of mankind?"
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,907.759,909.411,That... that may well be.
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.411,914.696,--What did John Adams think of the French?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,915.189,923.734,I read a biography of John Adams recently.
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,990.031,1008.441,"Before you go off on this, the one statistic that interested me... and I'd like you to discuss its relevance really... is if we look back 10 years, I have only three States executing a juvenile: Texas, 11; Virginia, 3; and Oklahoma, 2."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1008.441,1008.691,Correct.
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.691,1014.757,"And those three States account for about 11 percent of the population of the country, 11.3 percent."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1021.899,1026.457,"And if you go to the convictions rather than the executions, then Alabama goes into that mix."
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1026.457,1026.729,We have a very different number.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1026.729,1026.895,Right.
2004.03-633,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1026.895,1032.839,So the reason that I thought arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is there are a lot of States.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1062.273,1071.023,"Frankly, we don't know what those numbers mean because we don't know to what extent juveniles are committing capital level murders."
2004.03-633,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1148.753,1152.429,"At what point was this inserted into the record, Mr. Layton?"
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1152.429,1160.064,"The... the kind of... well, as to Mr. Simmons specifically, it came in in the post-conviction proceeding, and then was also present in the habeas record."
2004.03-633,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1169.353,1171.582,It was never... never tested in the trial court.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1171.582,1171.954,"--Oh, no."
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1181.863,1189.498,"Well, at least to the extent that he's simply quoting public sources, you had a chance to quote public sources in... in return."
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1189.498,1190.407,Absolutely.
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1190.407,1191.356,So I think you're... you're even on that--
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1191.356,1191.978,Absolutely.
2004.03-633,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1191.978,1192.842,--or at least your opportunity is.
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1192.842,1203.328,I... and I think the reason that we did that and we cited the difficulties in our reply brief with what he cited is to highlight that the precise age is a legislative question based on legislative type facts.
2004.03-633,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.48,1238.539,Does adolescence as a scientific term... does it always occur on the same day for... for all individuals?
2004.03-633,0,31466,james_r_layton,,1238.539,1238.91,No.
2004.03-633,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.507,1265.826,"Very well, Mr. Layton."
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1267.767,1275.569,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-633,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.425,1316.602,Can the constitutional calculus ever move in the other direction?
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1342.421,1343.702,"--Well, there is a--"

2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1372.488,1377.605,"--Well, you could... you could have, I guess, what I refer to as the Dickerson v. United States phenomenon."

2004.03-633,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.085,1484.603,"Well, how does one... how does one determine what is the better view?"
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1484.603,1499.297,"--I was... I was referring to the implication that it has often been said that because the European Union thinks something, we should, therefore, presume that the world views it that way."
2004.03-633,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.373,1502.269,Are you suggesting that we adopt that principle?

2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1713.519,1713.891,Well--
2004.03-633,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.891,1716.203,Is that just because of... is that just because of this modern evidence?
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1716.203,1717.029,"--No, no, no."

2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1901.757,1916.497,"--Justice Scalia, the number of States that engage in these executions is very small, and if it were all of the States, none of this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence would ever have to come... would ever have to be developed."
2004.03-633,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.952,1922.441,But that's precisely because the jury considers youthfulness as one of the mitigating factors.

Justice Scalia, there's no doubt... and the jury was instructed... that age is a mitigating factor although, Justice Kennedy, in response to your question, our brief points out prosecutors, in the context of future dangerousness, which is relevant, argue it all the time and jurors intuitively think it all the time."

2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2125.429,2125.801,--Right.
2004.03-633,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2140.89,2146.196,Suppose... suppose that all of the things set forth in your brief were eloquently set forth by a psychiatrist to the jury.

2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2215.881,2263.601,"Well, the... the... an argument to the jury that regardless of what a psychiatrist or a psychologist would have said about Christopher Simmons, as a group, 16 and 17-year-olds have such labile personalities that it is impossible to know whether they're... the crime that they committed reflected an enduring character is an argument that could have been made to spare this particular defendant, but it need not have been credited or given dispositive weight, particularly since at sentencing... and this Court has acknowledged this in cases like Pate v. Robinson and Drope v. Illinois... the jury is evaluating somebody, determining their moral blameworthiness 2 years later."
2004.03-633,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.601,2273.345,"But... but if you're reluctant to give it dispositive weight in an individual case, then you come in and ask us to give it dispositive weight as a general rule, that seems to me inconsistent."

2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2517.734,2521.653,"--Well, it's... I think it's... it's more than that in a couple of respects."

2004.03-633,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2663.817,2669.867,Is part of your answer based on the length of time between the killing and the trial?
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2669.867,2672.096,"Only part, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.03-633,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.872,2719.529,"Well, what if... what if a State said I see the problem, so we'll bring this person to trial in 6 weeks?"

2004.03-633,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2777.115,2781.777,I have... I have one other question I'd like to ask because it's been troubling me and I want your comment.
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2802.582,2803.408,--Well--
2004.03-633,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2803.408,2805.555,I'm... I'm very concerned about that.
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2805.555,2808.815,"--I... I am also concerned about it, and I... I have thought about this."
2004.03-633,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2827.929,2832.554,I'm talking about the deterrent value of the existing rule insofar as the 16 and 17-year-old.
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2836.391,2855.15,"--Well, I think... I think, as with the mentally retarded, or in fact, even more than with the mentally retarded, adolescents... the... the role of deterrence has even less to say, precisely because they weigh risks differently and they don't see the future and they are impulsive and they're subject to peer pressure."
2004.03-633,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2877.629,2893.233,"Well, there were a number... a number of cases in the Alabama amicus brief, which is chilling reading... and I wish that all the people that sign on to the amicus briefs had at least read that before they sign on to them... indicates that often the 17-year-old is the ringleader."
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2893.233,2902.854,"Well, the 17-year-old may be the ringleader, and even if you posit that Christopher Simmons was the ringleader here, he... he wasn't under any illusions."
2004.03-633,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.09,2987.477,"But of course, the death penalty was not a deterrent for any of the crimes described in the Alabama brief because those are all... crimes all occurred in States which execute people under 18."
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2987.477,2991.935,"--Yes, and I... and I... the... the examples in the Alabama brief are horrifying."
2004.03-633,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.937,3024.878,"Whereas if it had been done by an 18-year-old, a jury could have said that."

2004.03-633,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.908,3044.984,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2004.03-633,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3044.984,3045.139,Thank you.

2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3047.706,3052.081,"Mr. Simmons, of course, was found by the jury to be the ringleader."

2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3082.962,3086.594,I... I think that they are of equal weight in the minds of the legislators in the State of Missouri.
2004.03-633,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3093.281,3094.19,May I just ask one further?
2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3094.19,3094.396,--Yes.
2004.03-633,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.396,3101.083,"Is there any evidence that the death penalty for those under 18 or even above has, in fact, had any deterrent value?"
2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3101.083,3112.228,"From all that I have read, the evidence both directions is inconclusive, Your Honor, and thus, subject to legislators' determination."
2004.03-633,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.465,3273.43,"Of course, one... one of the objections in... in Atkins was we needed a bright line test."
2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3282.922,3284.12,"--Well, if that's the bright line."
2004.03-633,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3288.744,3296.38,"But the... but the purpose of a bright line test is to avoid litigation over the borderline cases, and you just have completely avoided that in this category."
2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3296.38,3306.661,"Because the... having a bright line test means that the individual who murders at age 17, 364 days is treated differently than a more... a less mature individual who is 2 days older."
2004.03-633,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.661,3309.633,"But it's an equally arbitrary line if it's 16, 17, or 15."
2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3309.633,3319.414,"Yes, it is, and it's an arbitrary line that the legislatures have set because it's a legislative type determination based on what even Mr. Waxman called legislative facts."
2004.03-633,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3319.414,3323.501,May I ask one... have you read the brief of the former U.S. diplomats in the case?
2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3323.501,3324.039,Yes.
2004.03-633,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3324.039,3327.466,Do you think we should give any credence whatsoever to the arguments they make?
2004.03-633,2,31466,james_r_layton,,3327.466,3328.042,No.
2004.03-633,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3328.581,3333.698,The respect of other countries for our country is something we should totally ignore.
