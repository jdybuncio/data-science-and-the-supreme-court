1989.89-369,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.754,"We'll hear argument first in No. 86-369, General Motors Corporation v. United States."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,11.672,15.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.083,248.728,"Well, Mr. Garrett, the statute, does it not, makes the terms of the original plan enforceable until a revision is approved, as I understand it."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,248.728,252.43,"Are you referring to Section 110(d) of the statute, Your Honor?"
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.43,254.466,Uh-huh.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,254.466,266.356,"Your Honor, it seems to us that the government's argument with respect to that section proves a little bit too much, and it's somewhat a mechanical and artificial reading of the statute."
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.18,292.055,"Well, of course, the SG takes the position that there is no four-month deadline requirement for action on proposed revisions."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,309.683,311.135,"--We disagree on that point, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.063,331.749,Well--
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,331.749,334.667,--they should be acting before they bring lawsuits.
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.667,347.475,--But the... the language of the statute dealing with the four months says the administrator shall within four months after the date required for submission of a plan under Paragraph 1.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,354.812,366.103,"The... if you're referring to Subsection (a)(3), that section deals entirely with revisions, and we believe--"
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.103,375.911,But (a)(3) says that the administrator will approve any revision if he determines that it meets the requirements of Paragraph 2.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,385.434,392.92,"--The language of the statute, I think, Your Honor, we have to be careful not to try to parse it a little bit too fine but to look to the overall intent of it."
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.664,450.559,"Well, I... I guess my question is specifically whether you would acknowledge that the language of the statute could be read as the Solicitor General says it should be read."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,450.559,460.665,"Our view, Your Honor, is that the language is intended to be a provision of incorporation, and it's plain, to us anyway, that Congress intended to incorporate all of (a)(2) into (a)(3)."
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,460.665,462.267,But it could be read otherwise?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,462.267,463.334,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.334,464.219,No?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,464.219,465.136,I really don't.
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.955,530.328,"It says... it says the required period, what four-month period has been required."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,530.328,539.45,"--Our position, Your Honor, is that the only reference that's logical is the required period for EPA to act on the revisions under Section (a)(3)."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.45,547.206,But that's... that's a required period after the... the SIPs must be submitted.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,566.351,568.619,"That's correct, Your Honor, and the statute does--"
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.619,571.071,That is the only required four-month period.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,593.834,597.305,"--Again, Your Honor, there's some distinctions that could be made."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.511,607.244,It makes sense to me.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,609.03,616.867,--It assumes that Congress really didn't intend that there be prompt action on revisions and that revisions somehow were less important than the original plans.
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.867,617.2,No.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,629.841,630.324,Let's assume--
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.324,633.96,And the four-month provision was just to get this Act off and running really fast.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,634.676,643.065,--Let's assume for the moment that the four-month provision is not applicable and that EPA's duty is to act within a reasonable time.
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.065,643.381,Good.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,645.617,651.771,"What that leads to is this, Your Honor, and this is the point I was trying to make a moment ago."
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,750.62,762.177,"Well, in circumstances as in this case, who should have the burden of proving that the revision meets the requirements and therefore has to be approved?"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,771.966,780.139,"That was the remedy that the court of appeals suggested... or, at least one of the two remedies that the court of appeals suggested, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.2,851.902,"The problem, Mr. Garrett, is once you abandon the form... well, you haven't abandoned it."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,883.873,884.239,That--
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.239,887.675,Reasonable time will vary enormously from... from one case to another.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,893.929,894.629,"--That's quite right, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.733,900.918,"--No, I know it's not your primary position."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,922.915,925.283,"No, Your Honor, we go a step further than that."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.255,959.624,Even before the four months expires?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,959.624,960.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,968.043,968.562,I see.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,969.562,971.112,--was approvable or not.
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,981.037,995.963,"Well, Mr. Garrett, what language in the statute would you point to to support that view that that's a requirement and that the EPA may not resort to enforcement actions?"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,998.415,1005.568,"Your Honor, there is not a particular provision in the sense of language saying that EPA may not bring an enforcement action."
1989.89-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1067.576,1076.915,"Well, they... they can enforce neither the original plan, because there's a revision pending, nor the revised plan, because that hasn't yet been approved."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1089.056,1095.043,"The... to some extent, Your Honor, the revision certainly would be enforceable in state court."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.043,1096.162,"Oh, it would?"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1096.695,1097.578,"We believe so, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.178,1101.316,"You know, all... all these revisions are not going to be in your client's favor."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1120.278,1120.978,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.894,1123.963,"Wow, that's... that's high risk."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1123.963,1137.839,"--The Clean Air Act... the way it's structured, Your Honor, requires that before a state submits a plan to EPA that it be adopted as a matter of state law and they be able to show EPA at the time that it's submitted that it's been promulgated and enforced."
1989.89-369,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1190.557,1196.961,"On the other hand, Massachusetts, your Commonwealth, is opposing you here, isn't it?"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1196.961,1199.913,"--Yes, and that's very puzzling, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1225.63,1227.697,"I'd like to some elaboration on one point, Mr.--"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1232.967,1255.066,"The... Massachusetts certainly believed, and still believes that the plan revision involved was in the public interest, and I would on that point urge the Court to look at the 1987 comments by the State of Massachusetts that we've lodged with the Clerk of the Court."
1989.89-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.707,1273.611,May I ask this question about the interplay between the state and the Federal authority?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1301.195,1302.213,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1333.649,1341.755,"No, but they would then have to at least make... make the finding that they approved the revision, just as they do in an ordinary revision situation."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1341.755,1343.272,"--Well, eventually EPA would, but during the--"
1989.89-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.272,1344.04,"No, not the EPA."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1346.14,1347.359,"--Oh, yes."
1989.89-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.359,1359.384,"So why couldn't... but if they've done that, and then your basic view of the state authority prevailed, why would they need to make any other finding because that in itself would become the law until EPA acted?"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1359.384,1369.506,"We would urge the Court to not read Section 110(g) as an exclusive remedy, basically, which is our second provision."
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.009,1441.204,"Mr. Garrett, what is the... what happens when an original plan is submitted and the EPA doesn't comply with the express four-month requirement for approval or disapproval?"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1441.204,1444.823,The very first plans under the Clean Air Act?
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.54,1448.525,Does the plan then become effective--
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1448.525,1448.908,--No.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.908,1450.144,--just... just by default?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1450.144,1461.534,"I think that the... my impression is that when we're talking about the original 70 Clean Air Act, that the states were trying to get the plans into EPA in a hurry, that EPA tried to act in four months."
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.455,1472.307,But the plan doesn't automatically go into effect after four months?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1472.307,1473.925,That's correct.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.925,1500.842,"Well, I don't think your... I take it your position is that... that when the revision is submitted and it is... it is... say, it isn't approved or disapproved within four months but finally it is disapproved, then, I take it, the company has to comply with the original plan from there on."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1500.842,1501.326,That's correct.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.326,1502.109,From there on?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1502.109,1502.659,That's correct.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.659,1506.563,But you say that they... until then they may not be fined--
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1506.563,1506.963,That's right.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.963,1508.196,--for their noncompliance?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1508.196,1509.015,And the reason is--
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.015,1509.948,Meanwhile.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1509.948,1510.882,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.882,1514.3,And that's true even if they act within four months?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1526.125,1530.012,"That's right, although as a practical matter that situation would virtually never arise."
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1530.012,1531.379,"Well, that's your position anyway."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1531.379,1532.012,Yes.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.463,1535.13,Uh-huh.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1535.13,1539.634,And then they can bring an enforcement action if violations occur beyond the 30th day.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1546.605,1552.192,"Well, it is... well, it's not unlikely that they... that they'll take longer than four months, obviously."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1567.019,1567.485,That's right.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.409,1584.413,"Well, but that's not... that's not very hard, I wouldn't think, until the plan... until the revision is approved--"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1584.413,1584.78,"--Well, if it's--"
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.78,1587.182,--you've been under an obligation.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1587.182,1589.384,--It's hard in two respects.
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.31,1639.317,"Well, I know, but your position is that... let's assume there was an express four months limit for a revision and let's say that EPA had never exceeded four months, you say that... that the company should be able to assume that the revision will be approved at least within that four-month period, because you... you say you're... you just don't have... you're excused from compliance with the original plan for... for up till four months."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1639.317,1643.185,"--What we're saying... now, the Cyanamid court actually adopted a slightly different approach."
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.304,1646.337,"Well, I know, but your position is--"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1646.337,1659.813,"Our position is that the company should look to state law and be expected to follow what the state adopted after public hearings until EPA makes a decision one way or the other, because EPA is in a state of neutrality at that point and the company ought to be able to assume--"
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.813,1668.502,"--But the statute requires before... before a state plan goes into effect originally, or a revision, the statute requires approval."
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1668.502,1669.552,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.021,1704.592,So you... you say the... the court of appeals didn't... didn't go far enough?
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1704.592,1705.275,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.275,1706.075,Yeah.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1711.429,1716.483,"The Fifth Circuit approach is the approach that comes closest to our position, yes."
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.633,1726.339,"--It is... it is the consequence of your position, if I understand it, that during the period that... that a revision is pending the Federal Government cannot enforce anything?"
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1734.029,1736.58,--With... with one small qualification.
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.265,1740.698,Right.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1740.698,1743.634,"--words, if the original plan says A plus B and they've been revised--"
1989.89-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.634,1744.117,Right.
1989.89-369,0,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,1744.117,1750.99,"--and the plan says A plus C and it's intended that there is some separate element, yes, certainly the Agency can enforce under that circumstance."
1989.89-369,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.087,1774.439,"Thank you, Mr. Garrett."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1779.99,1784.461,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1905.006,1914.929,"Mr. Wallace, would you agree that the EPA is required to act within a reasonable time on proposed revisions?"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1914.929,1915.912,Absolutely.
1989.89-369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.535,1945.733,"Well, what is a company to do if the EPA does not act on a proposed revision and when the facts show that the revision clearly meets the standards of the Act and must be approved ultimately?"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1969.266,1977.77,"--I think the court of appeals reached the correct answer, which is, yes, with two qualifications."
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.727,2143.429,"xxx in that regard, suppose the EPA approves a revision and... but meanwhile, obviously, the... the... or, it so happens that the company has not been living up to the unrevised plan, to the original one, can you then fine the company for that period up till approval of the revision?"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2143.429,2145.379,--A suit could be brought.
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.535,2153.768,So your answer to the question is yes?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2153.768,2154.485,--Yes.
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.485,2155.035,Yes.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2155.035,2163.408,"Although, as a matter of enforcement policy, EPA does not ordinarily bring such suits."
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.02,2194.445,"Of course, the company here had no real reason to think that that policy would apply because fairly early on, as I recall, there was indication that EPA would oppose this... this revision anyway."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2194.445,2199.766,--EPA even testified in the state proceedings that it had doubts about it.
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.716,2259.905,"In a way, Mr. Wallace, your position would be better for purposes of this case if you didn't have that humane enforcement policy."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2298.863,2299.663,Or the scheme--
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.663,2303.251,"Now, that wouldn't be a problem if you prosecuted everybody anyway, see?"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2307.202,2317.074,"--Even if we thought it appropriate to prosecute everybody, it would be hard to devote the resources to that endeavor."
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.133,2356.551,What do you have?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2357.051,2363.788,"--Well, in this little analysis I thought I would mention these three more points."
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.771,2494.006,xxx National Governors' Association position?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2494.006,2509.266,"--Well, that brief was earlier filed, and I think the Massachusetts brief which was filed along with ours as a bottom-side brief took into account that submission and improved on it considerably."
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.503,2517.52,"Well, it doesn't agree with you."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2519.638,2522.407,"--is... well, it goes part way."
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.047,2533.564,Yeah?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2533.564,2546.122,--the entire authority that the Act places in the court of appeals in reviewing EPA's action in disapproving a proposed SIP.
1989.89-369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.208,2657.545,"Well, you say it knew how to draft it, but what was it saying when it talked about the required four-month period in that very section?"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2657.545,2658.045,--Well--
1989.89-369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.045,2659.762,How good was its draftsmanship?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2659.762,2665.449,--We... we have addressed that in our brief to the best of our ability.
1989.89-369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2666.051,2668.551,Which suggests to me that you don't think it was very good draftsmanship.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2670.419,2682.227,--We suggest that the way that provision evolved may be an explanation of why there was a reference to a required four-month period.
1989.89-369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.545,2741.763,"Well, even if they're not all adopted at the same time, they're all part of the same statute now."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2741.763,2742.615,--That is correct.
1989.89-369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2742.615,2743.415,Yes.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2743.415,2745.651,And they can shed light on one another.
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.731,2779.038,It wouldn't make any... I... it wouldn't... wouldn't your position be exactly the same if there was an express four months provision for approval of a plan?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2779.038,2780.272,--It certainly would.
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.272,2780.99,So--
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2780.99,2783.859,That there should be no enforcement bar nonetheless.
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.859,2785.276,--Exactly.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2785.276,2796.5,"And as a matter of fact, we are entirely content with the judgment of the court of appeals, even though we think the court of appeals was wrong in saying--"
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2796.5,2800.702,"Well, every court of appeals has implied a four-month period, contrary to your view."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2800.702,2803.171,"--Well, we hesitated because of that."
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2810.527,2810.994,"Well, yes, but--"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2810.994,2811.46,--think it makes--
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.46,2811.844,--your position--
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2811.844,2812.344,--much sense.
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.344,2814.211,--Your position remains the same on enforcement.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2814.211,2817.413,It... it remains the same as the First Circuit's position.
1989.89-369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.413,2836.392,"Then, if it does, I don't know why you are... you lie down for the court of appeals' view that... that your enforcement power really is limited by the discretion of a judge to keep you from fining this company if it makes certain determinations."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2836.392,2854.955,"Well, see... well, we agree with the court of appeals that the question in the penalty phase is whether there was unreasonable delay by EPA to the prejudice of... the company and how that should be taken into account."
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2901.201,2911.625,"Mr. Wallace, could you explain to me again what... what effect you do give to... to the... to the reference to the required four-month period in (g)(1)?"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2915.927,2917.279,--We... we take that--
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.279,2918.029,You say that--
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2918.029,2938.276,"--as a guide that in the situation when the state brings to our attention that it's a temporary emergency suspension-type of situation, where the governor is at least contemplating invoking that authority, that EPA is supposed to act within four months."
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.276,2941.478,--And the suspension only lasts within... for four months?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2941.478,2943.446,He can then suspend it for four months.
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.623,2960.256,"(1)(a), right."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2960.256,2964.677,On the very first page of the appendix to our brief.
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.081,2970.698,Right.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2970.698,2973.366,--after the little inset part--
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.366,2974.216,Right.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2974.216,2983.221,"--it says, which the administrator has not approved or disapproved under this section within the required four-month period."
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.465,3026.084,I see.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3026.084,3043.546,"So the court of appeals felt that in interpreting the Act as not otherwise allowing the courts to impose an enforcement bar, it was reconciling the '77 amendments with the '70 Act."
1989.89-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3063.507,3072.129,"But getting back to the statute, you simply take the words ""the required"" and say they're synonymous with the word ""a""?"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3072.129,3072.613,Well--
1989.89-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3072.613,3074.731,"""Within a four-month period""?"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3074.731,3076.1,--We think... yes.
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.654,3121.712,"Mr. Wallace, I'm... I'm a little surprised that the government is so lackadaisical about, you know, whether it's four months or who cares whether it's a four-month requirement or not."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3134.954,3145.927,"Mr. Justice, I thought we were quite clearly saying that the four-month requirement does not apply and would be impractical to try to apply--"
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.927,3153.517,But you said you're perfectly content to accept a lower court's decision on that and all the other courts of appeals which have said you're supposed to be acting within four months.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3153.517,3154.3,--If... if--
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.3,3158.569,I would think that that's... that's the part of this case you should be most upset with.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3202.581,3207.116,"--Well, we don't believe it applies to us, and that is our submission to this Court."
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3254.281,3265.653,"But... but, Mr. Wallace, you say it's not part of the statute, but it is a part of the statute as construed by several courts of appeals, which normally creates some kind of a duty to comply."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3265.653,3272.493,"--Well, we're... we're doing the best we can, but we... we--"
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.493,3272.926,"No, you're not."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3275.11,3275.61,"--Well, we--"
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.61,3277.144,You're not even trying.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3282.098,3284.133,--We're... the--
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3284.133,3285.116,"Well, maybe it's very--"
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3285.116,3301.595,"--There are other obligations under the Act, substantive obligations in the way we're to handle these proposed revisions, which have to be reconciled with whatever time limit the courts might think is the statutory guide to regulatory action."
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3339.451,3339.887,--Well--
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3339.887,3342.303,--in... in the bill as it now exists.
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3344.855,3348.576,--Is this bill drafted by the same guy that put in the required four-month period?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3351.945,3358.932,"--And there is another provision that relates to the issue of this case, and I will read that sentence to the Court."
1989.89-369,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3401.526,3404.728,By way of anticipatory subsequent legislative history?
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3404.728,3405.413,"Well, I... I'm--"
1989.89-369,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3456.262,3462.749,"Maybe, again, Mr. Wallace, we're dealing with very bad draftsmanship in Congress."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3463.516,3467.986,Not... not the first time.
1989.89-369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3565.484,3572.221,"Yeah, but they're only temporary enforcement after the state has said, we think it's perfectly safe to do it."
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3572.221,3572.721,That is--
1989.89-369,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3572.721,3576.34,So then emergency you're talking is rather unlikely to arise.
1989.89-369,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3576.34,3603.173,"--Well, still and all, we're talking about interpreting an act that applies to a variety of emissions, some of which are much more serious in their short-term effects than others, and mistakes are made in these submissions, and mistakes that can have serious consequences."
1989.89-369,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3606.208,3608.141,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Wallace."
1989.89-369,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3611.51,3613.695,"Just a few brief points, Your Honor."
1989.89-369,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3701.753,3703.12,"Thank you, Mr. Garrett."
