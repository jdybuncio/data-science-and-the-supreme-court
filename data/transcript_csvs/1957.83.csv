1957.83,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.811,"Number 83, Richard McAllister, Petitioner versus Magnolia -- Magnolia Petroleum Company."
1957.83,0,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,24.595,27.892,May it please the Court.
1957.83,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,65.999,67.446,"Where was it filed, Mr. Mandell?"
1957.83,0,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,67.446,68.679,In Houston.
1957.83,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,68.679,69.326,In Houston.
1957.83,0,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,69.326,69.626,Yes.
1957.83,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,69.626,70.532,In the state court?
1957.83,0,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,70.532,71.232,The state court --
1957.83,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,71.232,71.76,Yes.
1957.83,0,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,71.76,75.867,-- and removed to the State Court of Dallas County.
1957.83,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,370.341,377.131,"Mr. Mandell, did you alleged specifically what it was in your complaint that cause --"
1957.83,0,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,377.131,377.432,Yes.
1957.83,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,377.432,378.662,-- the vessel to be unseaworthy?
1957.83,0,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,378.662,403.106,"Yes, particularly I say the vessel was unseaworthy in that setting specifically that portholes were not watertight and water would come through, the largest are from the stairs that the deck above the galley was not watertight, that water would come through and lodge itself on the steps very specifically set out."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1398.433,1401.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1957.83,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1793.377,1797.234,But if it's based on both --
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1797.234,1797.753,Sir --
1957.83,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1797.753,1804.983,"-- gathered then I suppose, he must proceed within the two years or his -- takes his chance of losing out."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1804.983,1810.658,If these facts do not sustain his negligent count then he does have that --
1957.83,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1810.658,1819.772,"As a practical matter, we have something here that implicates only the unseaworthiness but ordinary negligence suit under the Jones Act."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1819.772,1822.903,Yes -- yes sir.
1957.83,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1823.128,1826.782,"It's a rather -- rather direct bearing upon them too, I would think."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1826.782,1830.307,"I would think so, sir."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1915.796,1920.143,"Well, that's not in dispute between you as I understood Mr. Mandell."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1922.374,1923.21,Not of the negligence.
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1923.74,1934.42,"No, it's not in dispute that the case that's now before us is as though he had laid merely unseaworthiness."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1934.42,1936.751,"I believe that -- that certainly is my position, Your Honor."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1939.386,1949.191,"Well, the fact that you joined the two and the other one as you say the defendant has exonerated, it doesn't change the nature of the legal problem now before us."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1949.191,1950.046,"No, sir."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1950.046,1952.507,All right.
1957.83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1952.507,1964.17,Mr. Bolton is there any significance in the language of Jones Act may at his election maintain an action?
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1964.17,1965.361,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.332,1990.339,I don't quite understand.
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,1998.245,1998.471,"No, sir."
1957.83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2021.902,2021.936,Well --
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2021.936,2022.868,-- such as distinct.
1957.83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2022.868,2038.419,"Well, to that extent at least, does the recognition of an action based on unseaworthiness implied in the provision that he may at his election?"
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2038.419,2043.403,"Well, that I -- I don't quite know that I understand the Court's question but if -- if I --"
1957.83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2043.403,2056.934,"Well, what I'm -- what I'm trying to get at is, is there any recognition in the statute that the election is as between an action which would be founded upon or based upon the FELA principle?"
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2056.934,2057.71,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2057.71,2067.19,And an action founded upon alleged unseaworthiness.
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2067.19,2089.637,"Justice Brennan, I believe that -- that is the question which the courts below have had some difficulty in determining and -- and the most recent way to authority I think is that the election is only as to whether he proceeds before a jury or proceeds admiralty."
1957.83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2089.637,2090.277,In admiralty.
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2090.277,2096.524,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2096.524,2102.309,"Well, I -- after all, the statute of limitations, you suggested that substantive --"
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2102.309,2111.988,I -- I suggested that it's substantive in the Jones Act I -- I would say that the Texas Act which was applied by the court below is procedure and it is so been held.
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2178.528,2191.068,"May I -- may I ask, I heard nothing about any light shed by the legislative history of the Jones Act."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2195.81,2228.118,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I originally thought that I had a very good point of law that the amendment to the FELA, the 1939 Amendment of the FELA could not be attributed to apply it to the Jones Act and just about the time that we argued or we're arguing our motions below this Court rendered its opinion in the Cox versus Roth case and my confidence in that point materially decreased and so I -- I have abandoned that."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2255.763,2263.599,"But -- but on -- on the statute of limitations, there's no light as to -- secondly, I gather not -- secondly --"
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2263.599,2265.301,"No, sir."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2265.301,2287.612,-- it is a bit surprising that there should be seemingly as little light on the substance -- on the actual determination whether the Jones Act does or doesn't apply where an action is brought merely for unseaworthiness or that's the only claim that is sustained.
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2299.115,2333.805,"Well, this Court has have before its famous cases which could not have reached here had counsels contention been correct for example in the Mahnich versus Southern Steamship Company case, that was a case which was admittedly filed after the prescriptive period in the Jones Act through it was filed in evidently and the -- the six-year, I believe it was the six-year statute which was applied in the State in which the court set and this Court in its action sent back for trial on the issues of the situation there."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2349.512,2361.246,"Of course you might have to meet the argument if the Jones Act sets the minimum but if a state wants to give more, that doesn't contradict the Jones Act."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2363.006,2364.361,"I -- I do not either, sir."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2389.819,2402.491,"Well, if -- if it -- if the mode of enforcement because the locality of the injury is local, is left to local law, that's not the difficult -- anyhow, New York had can work that out if it wants to."
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2402.491,2403.766,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2403.766,2404.026,But --
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2404.026,2405.436,I see nothing wrong with that.
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2428.881,2431.833,And even Texas lawyers have to be familiar with that.
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2431.833,2432.145,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2432.145,2436.377,I mean the independent Republic of Texas even have to take account of that National Law that --
1957.83,1,23640,frank_c_bolton_jr,,2436.377,2436.697,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2443.657,2447.971,"Mr. Mandell, you may proceed."
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2447.971,2455.726,I -- I think perhaps I maybe of aid to the Court in reference to the history of the legislation.
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2595.652,2631.547,"Mr. Mandell, you stated with great candor that prior to the Jones Act, the local law of limitation where it's decide by Congress to be applied to suits in state courts and also the federal court to suit in any court state or federal giving a maritime right for unseaworthiness, if you're in maintenance et cetera or subject to the local law of limitation, is that right?"
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2631.547,2632.666,Partially right.
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2632.666,2632.697,What's wrong about it?
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2632.697,2636.578,I don't agree with -- I don't agree with you Justice Frankfurter.
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2641.324,2642.134,"Very well, I accept your --"
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2642.134,2642.984,"Yes, yes."
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2642.984,2644.179,-- your correction.
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2644.179,2645.289,Yes.
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2645.289,2655.804,"Congress cause act and not act, if Congress doesn't act in an area in which it doesn't give a statute of limitation then that's the policy of Congress that the local law should apply would you agree to that?"
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2655.804,2660.906,I say that local law must apply in the absence of -- of congressional action or (Voice Overlap) --
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2660.906,2670.851,Because Congress has chosen not to leave the local law to be applicable to transactions that transpire local.
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2670.851,2671.313,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2671.313,2673.825,"That's the policy, isn't it from the beginning of our history?"
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2673.825,2675.626,If known action means policy.
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2675.626,2676.166,"Well, I --"
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2676.166,2678.31,"If non-action means policy, yes, sir."
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2678.31,2679.701,I do want to take your time in --
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2679.701,2680.236,Yes sir.
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2680.236,2681.136,-- talking about words.
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2688.44,2689.673,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2689.673,2693.972,"Although, the right derives from federal constitution on those law."
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2694.579,2695.363,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2695.363,2697.293,Very well.
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2703.249,2704.456,Thank you sir.
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2704.456,2748.478,"Will you indicate -- will you state, you tell me whether there -- tell the Court whether there is the slightest intimation in the course of that history that Congress was concerned with the enforceable rights for -- of maritime law regarding unseaworthiness when it passed the Jones Act or rather whether it was concerned to undo what I believe to be the undesirable cause of decisions in this Court and give recovery under the Jones Act not only different substantive rights but also the right of recovery to those who is -- who-- in cases of death."
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2761.04,2761.556,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2761.556,2762.869,That's a very big except.
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2763.273,2763.351,"Yes, sir."
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2763.351,2764.336,-- the purpose.
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2764.336,2765.468,"Except -- yes, Your Honor."
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2765.554,2774.583,Is there anything that you find in anybody's utterance that was concerned with changing the then existing law regarding unseaworthiness?
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2774.583,2777.504,"Yes, Justice Frankfurter, the very language of the statute (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.83,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2777.504,2787.469,"Well, I can read that as whether you can, but apart from that, is there anything in how the language of the statute does that I cannot see for the light of it."
1957.83,2,16569,arthur_j_mandell,,2787.469,2791.532,Thank you very much.
