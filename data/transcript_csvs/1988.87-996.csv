1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.872,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in No. 87-996, Coit Independence Joint Venture v. FSLIC."
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,13.891,17.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.007,220.859,"Mr. Goodfriend, FSLIC has retreated substantially--"
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,220.859,221.395,Yes.
1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.395,223.878,--in this Court from the doctrine of the Hudspeth case.
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,224.294,226.144,"Yes, Your Honor, and I was about to get exactly to that point."
1988.87-996,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.589,252.278,May I also inquire whether as of this time the claim of your client has ever been acted upon--
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,252.278,254.08,"No, it has not, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.08,255.147,--administratively?
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,256.349,258.599,"Exactly, retained for further review."
1988.87-996,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.256,280.214,"Now, do you take the position that the statutes do not permit FSLIC, as you call it, to adopt an administrative--"
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,280.214,280.847,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.847,281.93,--exhaustion requirement?
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,281.93,303.746,"We... we reject both the initial position of the Fifth Circuit, which was a subject matter jurisdiction position, and we also reject the revised position of the Solicitor General which concerns agency-mandated exhaustion, which we wish to clearly distinguish from court-mandated exhaustion, which was referred to somewhat in the Morrison-Knudsen case."
1988.87-996,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.761,360.13,"And if there is de novo review, there wouldn't be any Article III problems."
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,360.13,362.748,"Your Honor, I think... we think there still is."
1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.246,411.598,How has the delay hurt your client in this case?
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,411.598,416.716,"Your Honor, the delay we say has hurt our client in a number of ways."
1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,438.712,444.616,But would your be... but would your being able to get into court earlier than you have effect that at all--
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,444.616,444.949,Absolutely.
1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.949,446.235,--because it's in still a receivership.
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,446.235,446.868,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.903,455.605,But supposing the validity of your claim had been determined in a state court.
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,455.605,455.771,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.771,460.306,Would it have advanced your client's position so far as his dollars and cents are concerned?
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,460.306,478.767,"Well, what we say is we would then be in line for a potential distribution from the receiver depending upon the priority of our claims under FSLIC's regulations, and we might receive substantially more money, maybe 50 percent of the amount of our total claim, instead of two or three years down the line, maybe we might receive only 20 percent."
1988.87-996,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.767,484.088,"That's a... that would be kind of unusual for a receivership to distribute in that manner, wouldn't it?"
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,484.088,491.825,"Well, my understanding is that interim... interim distributions from a receivership estate are authorized."
1988.87-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.572,588.406,Excuse me.
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,588.406,589.239,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.239,593.108,I assume that you would have no judicial remedy for that foreclosure?
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,593.108,615.973,"Your Honor, as I understand the Board's position, in its regulations they say that when property is posted for foreclosure, a... the owner of that property has five working days to seek relief from FSLIC... excuse me... from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which is the supervisory agency over FSLIC, from the foreclosure."
1988.87-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.839,641.79,Being... being deprived of your property by foreclosure is not--
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,641.79,642.206,Absolutely.
1988.87-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.206,644.14,--is not an added threat unless you miss the five days.
1988.87-996,0,39336,robert_e_goodfriend,,644.14,645.675,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1754.236,1768.495,"Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court:"
1988.87-996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.313,1875.431,You say that there's a statute that requires exhaustion?
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1875.431,1879.717,"No, Your Honor, we do not say that there's a statute that expressly requires exhaustion."
1988.87-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.578,1927.13,The only issue is whether that includes the power to cut off a claim.
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1932.266,1935.218,There's... we're not asserting that the Bank Board has the power to cut off a claim.
1988.87-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.078,1960.934,"--Aren't you... aren't you claiming that if... if... if a claim is not presented timely to FSLIC, the claim is cut off?"
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1960.934,1967.271,But that... that really results... that result follows from failure to comply with the administrative process.
1988.87-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.271,1969.021,"Well, to be sure."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1973.889,1986.614,"But, Your Honor, I think the same thing would happen under the Social Security Act, for instance, if a party refused to comply with the Secretary's regulations governing the... the pursuit of a claim in the administrative forum."
1988.87-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.087,2004.658,"Under the Social Security Act, the claimant must establish his claim before the Social Security Administration."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2026.655,2032.309,"Your Honor, without that sort of power, it would be impossible to conduct any sort of liquidation procedure at all."
1988.87-996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.96,2068.582,"Mr. Minear, is it de novo judicial review, if you want to call it judicial review, when a person takes a claim to court after it has been passed down by the Board?"
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2068.582,2071.867,"Well, Your Honor, first this question isn't squarely presented here, and we think--"
1988.87-996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2071.867,2073.267,"Well, but I... I think it's very useful."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2098.184,2101.886,"--We submit as follows with respect to that question, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2123.566,2126.168,"Well, that's where FSLIC, in effect, denies the claim."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2126.168,2126.734,--Yes.
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.488,2133.322,Most claims are granted.
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2136.124,2137.492,"Yes, that's--"
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.492,2140.261,--And it's very important to get those out of the way.
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2140.261,2141.094,--Exactly.
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.069,2163.459,"Because in the... in the claims process that's provided for by the regulations, it doesn't contemplate any kind of a hearing, just a filing and a paper... a paper presentation."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2163.459,2166.744,"They can, in fact... FSLIC can, in fact, require an oral presentation."
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.744,2167.827,"I... I know they can, but they--"
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2167.827,2168.71,"They can require it, but they do not."
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.779,2172.429,--But the... but the claimant has no right to an oral presentation.
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2172.429,2174.231,"No, he does not have a right to oral presentation."
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.231,2178.718,"So, it just... it just contemplates a... a tentative decision about it."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2180.468,2181.368,Yes.
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.368,2183.354,"If they're not, why, you're going to litigate."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2183.354,2183.77,Yes.
1988.87-996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.206,2222.295,"Mr. Minear, after FSLIC turns down a claim, is its denial of the claim entitled to any weight in the judicial proceeding?"
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2222.295,2228.901,"The Bank Board has argued in a number of cases that it's subject to APA review, and the Solicitor General disagrees with that position."
1988.87-996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.901,2230.235,What does the Solicitor General--
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2230.235,2233.52,The Solicitor General's position is that the party begins his claim anew.
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.561,2274.395,--What about time?
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2284.035,2287.987,"Yes, generally, but there's also an APA remedy in the... in the event--"
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.987,2293.974,"Well, can't... do you... can't the party just file a suit?"
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2299.961,2304.747,"--We submit that he cannot, that simply the receivership process will not work under--"
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.747,2306.365,"Well, how does he avoid the statute of limitations?"
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2306.365,2308.532,--There's a couple of ways.
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.018,2312.935,"Well, they often aren't."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2314.135,2320.039,"--Well, in this respect, Your Honor, that there has been a claim here that this claim has lingered for 13 months, and I do have to clarify the record on that."
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.039,2320.522,"Well, let's--"
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2320.522,2321.022,When this--
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.022,2323.474,--You don't have to do that till you answer this question.
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2323.474,2323.807,--Sure.
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.807,2324.824,What about the statute of limitations?
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2324.824,2325.257,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.185,2342.151,"Well, but FSLIC you say may--"
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2342.151,2342.751,Yes.
1988.87-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.751,2343.718,--Why would it do that?
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2346.853,2351.541,"But, Your Honor, the... the... FSLIC's interest here is in a fair resolution of these claims."
1988.87-996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2373.821,2376.59,What... what if you want to go to state court and sue?
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2376.59,2382.327,"Well, there's still the APA remedy in those circumstances for, in fact, obtaining--"
1988.87-996,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2382.327,2391.932,"So, you bring a separate APA suit in federal court against FSLIC for unlawfully delaying your claim before you can go into state court and file a claim on the merit."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2391.932,2396.634,"--Yes, Your Honor, but that... first of all, these... these threats are all rather hypothetical."
1988.87-996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.406,2407.708,"Yes, but it hasn't resolved the claim that your opponent is fighting about."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2407.708,2409.394,"And there's a reason for that, Your Honor."
1988.87-996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.592,2437.211,"Yes, but of course, you probably have read the complaint, and you're a party to the litigation."
1988.87-996,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2439.496,2444.698,"--Well, yes, your... but, Your Honor, there is still... in order for... these determinations are made by separate parties."
