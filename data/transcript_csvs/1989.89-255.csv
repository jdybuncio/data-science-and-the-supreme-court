1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.189,"We'll hear first this morning in Number 89-255, United States against Energy Resources Co.--"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,12.558,15.926,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,69.41,76.75,Is there some basis in law for the IRS allocation?
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,84.32,87.522,--That's... the IRS has a policy of permitting the taxpayers to designate--
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,87.522,88.641,"Well, is there some basis in law for that?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,88.641,97.997,"--There is no, there is no legal provision that directs the IRS how to allocate, either voluntary or involuntary or any other kind of payment."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.099,104.483,The IRS is just big hearted on voluntary payments?
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,107.602,109.019,--It's not a question of being--
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.019,109.904,--that you're complying with some common law rule?
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,109.904,114.356,"--It's not a question of being big hearted, I don't think, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.35,159.285,It seems to me there are other penalties for forcing the IRS to go to court.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,165.641,166.508,I don't think--
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.508,172.378,It seems to me that you're doing this for voluntary payments simply because that's what the law is.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,193.708,194.375,"--Your Honor, that's--"
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,194.375,196.41,You consider these to be involuntary payments?
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,196.41,198.445,"--Well, in this case these are involuntary payments."
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.72,248.795,"Well, is it your claim in this case that the district court was, that the bankruptcy court was bound to respect the IRS policy with respect to involuntary payments?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,248.795,256.132,Our position here is that the bankruptcy court had nothing to do with how the IRS was going to allocate payments.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,266.923,284.635,"But do you think there is some legal... some legal basis that you argue that the bankruptcy court was wrong, namely that it should have... it should have preserved your right to get at this... at the officers?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,284.635,296.943,"Well, we are... we do argue, which I plan to explain in more detail a little bit later, that there are a lot of policies that are embodied both in the Internal Revenue Code and the Bankruptcy Code that... with which there is at least some tension with what the bankruptcy court did here."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.383,329.83,"The reason it is important to me, why the IRS is... does this with respect to voluntary payments, is I have no idea what the difference is between voluntary and involuntary, or where one looks for that distinction, except you invite us to look to what the IRS has done in the past."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,347.041,350.577,--I think the IRS' own policy is just tied to the will of the IRS.
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.981,358.033,"It's called the common law, it was called."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,358.033,365.17,"--Well, I don't think there is any common law rule that requires the IRS to do this, or that the common law binds the IRS."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.378,380.346,But you choose to call this involuntary.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,384.132,392.987,"--Well, I think to the extent that some of the bankruptcy courts in this area have fought over what the IRS' policy is, I think you are right."
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.724,402.259,"All the lower courts upheld that conclusion, didn't they, that--"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,402.259,403.243,--All the courts of appeals have.
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.378,405.995,--That these were involuntary payments.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,405.995,406.997,"--Yes, that is correct."
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.997,415.353,Then the question we granted certiorari on is whether the authority of the bankruptcy court to allocate tax payments under these circumstances.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,415.353,416.553,"Well, that's true."
1989.89-255,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.061,464.417,"Mr. Horowitz, did the bankruptcy court have the power to approve these plans over the objections of the IRS?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,464.417,478.259,"The bankruptcy court is required under Section 1129... Section 1129 sets forth a lot of requirements for confirmation of a plan, and the bankruptcy court can only confirm a plan if it meets those requirements."
1989.89-255,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.603,502.042,Does the IRS have an express policy in its manual to the effect that it will comply with orders of the bankruptcy court?
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,502.042,503.442,Absolutely.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.063,523.304,One of these plans actually provided for the prior allocation of these payments to the ordinary tax liability.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,523.304,525.824,To the trust fund tax liability.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.824,526.307,Yes.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,526.307,526.69,Yes.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,553.473,553.923,Yes.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,553.923,556.759,"And then they went and got a court order, which is where--"
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.759,559.127,"In the other case now, the other case... what about the other case?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,559.127,561.913,"--The other case, as I recall, they just went and got a court order first."
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.913,566.198,"Well, there was a... I think there was a provision in the plan, wasn't there, to pay--"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,566.198,580.208,"Well, there may have been a provision in the plan to which the IRS objected, and claimed that the bankruptcy court does not have the authority to require us how to... remember, what the bankruptcy court has done here is... there is no question that the money is being paid to the IRS."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.397,594.967,"--You mean the question is whether it becomes the IRS' money, until the IRS agrees to accept it in the manner in which is it offered."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,594.967,605.506,"Well, that I think is the difference between what everyone agrees is a voluntary payment and what we have here, because under Section 1129 there is no plan, unless the IRS... these payments are made to the IRS."
1989.89-255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,614.695,634.592,"If we were to rule against you in this case, would the IRS in future reorganizations have the capacity to object to a plan and block a reorganization on the grounds that it objected to the allocation?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,634.592,637.544,If you hold that the bankruptcy court has the power to--
1989.89-255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,637.544,637.994,Right.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,637.994,639.246,"--No, I don't think so."
1989.89-255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,640.662,645.031,"In other words, as a creditor it could not object to the approval of the plan?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,645.031,645.466,--That is right.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,666.063,679.204,"I am surprised that you say that the trust fund taxes and the other taxes are of the same quality, or they--"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,679.204,680.021,Same priority.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.021,680.739,"--Same priority, is that what you say?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,680.739,681.373,Same priority.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.373,685.308,But the trust fund taxes belong to somebody.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,685.308,687.41,"Well, they once belonged to somebody."
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.477,688.96,Yes.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,688.96,694.997,"There was a trust fund, and there are a lot of rights that the IRS has in that trust fund as long as it exists."
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.069,702.669,That's right.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,702.669,707.39,But what's happened here is that the trust funds have completely been dissipated by the officers.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.9,731.006,"Well, the court of appeals ruled that the equitable power of the bankruptcy court included the power to prefer the restoration or the payment of these trust fund taxes first."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,731.006,734.374,"That is what the court of appeal held, incorrectly in my view."
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.374,740.528,Were these monies generated after the petition was filed or before the petition was filed?
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,740.528,741.944,The payments that are being made--
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.944,744.146,"Not the payments, the money that is being used to make the payments."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,745.848,750.717,--I would guess that it was generated after the petition was filed.
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.717,754.454,"Because if it was generated before, then it would have had to go to the IRS."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,754.454,759.339,"I think the IRS had a claim, yes, that it was not to be put in the bankruptcy estate at all, but--"
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,759.339,761.608,And it would have belonged definitely in the trust fund--
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,761.608,762.058,--Right.
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.058,763.31,--under your theory in this other case.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,763.31,763.66,Yes.
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,806.304,810.958,You said the designation provision which the court imposed.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,813.66,815.043,"Yes, I mean the bankruptcy court."
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,815.043,817.628,And how would you describe it?
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,817.628,825.883,The bankruptcy court ordered the IRS to apply the payments that it receives first to all of the trust fund liability of the corporation.
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.095,846.214,"But these payments are being made out of the bankruptcy estate, right?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,846.214,846.714,That is correct.
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.714,850.266,And need the authority of the bankruptcy court to make them.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,850.266,854.635,"Well, the... what the bankruptcy court does is it confirms the plan of reorganization."
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.448,873.581,You just follow the plan.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,873.581,875.75,"You follow the plan, right."
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.75,881.035,"There is no regulation, formal regulation relating to this controversy, is there?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,881.035,884.256,As far as how the IRS allocates payments?
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.256,884.556,Yes.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,884.556,890.91,"No, there are various revenue procedures about how the IRS allocates this money first."
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.016,935.189,"The plan is silent on this point, I take it, as to how the IRS is to apply the payments?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,935.189,935.539,No.
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,945.211,951.281,"In both cases, then, there is a provision... the plan specifies how the payments are to be made?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,951.281,951.898,I believe so.
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.852,959.387,"Well, how the payments will be applied by the IRS."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,959.387,964.791,"--There is a court order, I think it's incorporated in the plan in at least one case--"
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.791,966.291,I think it is in one and not in the other.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,986.204,989.173,"--Well, at what stage do... you mean before he went into bankruptcy?"
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.173,990.073,"No, no."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,998.445,999.897,"Well, I don't know."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.051,1059.586,Is it before the bankruptcy either.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1063.388,1068.025,"They were... they were under a legal obligation to pay, but they weren't subject to a court order."
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.214,1079.583,"And in fact they had a duty, I suppose, to pay the trust fund obligation first."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1085.653,1086.303,That is correct.
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.303,1086.97,--the day before bankruptcy.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1086.97,1087.453,That is correct.
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.022,1092.324,And that of course is just for the benefit of the officers of the corporation in a sense.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1092.324,1093.591,"--That would benefit, well--"
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.591,1098.645,"It's the same, the same mix of allocation of risks as you have the day after the bankruptcy."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1098.645,1104.465,"--Well, but the difference is, if... you are suggesting that there is no trust fund liability in the bankruptcy at all--"
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.465,1105.015,"No, no, no."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1117.089,1126.397,"--Well, if there is money there then it's not part of the bankruptcy, and it is being paid before the bankruptcy, whether you want to say it's technically or really, but it is being paid outside the bankruptcy."
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.434,1139.088,"But you say the equities, or the priorities should suddenly change the day the bankruptcy petition is filed."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1139.088,1140.605,--It's not a question of the priorities changing.
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1157.599,1161.385,"Well, and for discharging a tax obligation of all the former employees, too."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1161.385,1169.641,"Yes, but in a sense the tax obligation is being paid... is being guaranteed, shall I say, by the government, not by the responsible officers any more."
1989.89-255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.641,1178.08,"But it is a policy of the government, is it not, to accelerate payments of the trust fund?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1194.541,1203.83,"I don't think there is a policy, when you have two tax liabilities, that one has to be paid ahead of the other, because dollars are dollars to the IRS."
1989.89-255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.844,1228.78,"Yes, but the reason for that is so that the trust fund obligation is paid."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1228.78,1231.564,"--Is paid on time, yes."
1989.89-255,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.964,1235.618,"And is paid before a general corporate tax, if that is also due and owing."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1240.27,1246.974,"--Well, that is true, but again that is because... that's not the corporation making a payment out of its own funds to the government."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.978,1255.263,"Whatever the reason, it gets the officers off the hook."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1257.365,1261.484,"If the officers turn over, if they turn over the trust fund to the government they are not on the hook in the first place."
1989.89-255,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1283.366,1299.192,"--Mr. Horowitz, do you think the government will be more likely to collect all its taxes if, by insisting on this policy, it has the effect of forcing the debtor into a Chapter 7 liquidation instead of Chapter 11?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1299.192,1302.644,The government's policy does not force debtors into Chapter 7 liquidation.
1989.89-255,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1302.644,1304.43,"Well, it could."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1339.103,1341.805,"Well, I disagree with the premise of your question, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.138,1425.125,"Mr. Horowitz, before bank ruptcy, the trust fund was dissipated before bankruptcy, I take it."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1425.125,1429.161,Either before bankruptcy or before anyone could get at it after the bankruptcy.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.161,1435.247,And so the officers... it seems to me the officers' obligation matured right then.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1436.599,1438.266,"They should have paid even before that, probably."
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.266,1438.799,Yes.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1446.122,1448.24,"Well, we can sue them now, but--"
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.24,1453.026,"And why shouldn't the... is there a trustee in this case, or these cases?"
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1453.026,1455.661,--There is a trustee in at least one of the cases there is a trustee.
1989.89-255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.661,1469.738,"I would think the debtor could collect from the officers the trust fund that was dissipated, or at least they owe somebody, the officers, they dissipated the trust fund, they should owe somebody right now."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1469.738,1484.847,"Well, I don't know if the debtor has an action against the officers or not, but the problem with the IRS going after the officers directly is that the officers can string out the litigation for quite a while by posting a bond, litigating it, et cetera, et cetera."
1989.89-255,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1517.301,1528.526,"Suppose you had a reorganization and the officers said we are willing to make this company run, but we want to make sure that our trust fund obligation is discharged first by the corporation."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1534.18,1535.563,"--The IRS could agree, yes."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1540.834,1545.654,"Mr. Horowitz, before you stop, what do you say... you started to talk about Chapter 11."
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1561.93,1563.03,"--Well, it's our position that--"
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.03,1565.132,So the issue is just whether this is appropriate?
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1565.132,1565.565,--That is right.
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.417,1569.686,Of this title.
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1569.686,1570.386,"Yes, of this title."
1989.89-255,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.386,1572.055,You assert it's inconsistent with the--
1989.89-255,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1572.055,1588.898,"Well, there is also... well, we think it is at least somewhat inconsistent with the general idea in Chapter 11, which is specifically embodied, I think, in Section 1123(a)(4), which is that the court is not to distinguish among claims that have the same priorities."
1989.89-255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.47,1599.638,"--Very well, Mr. Horowitz."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,1607.728,1611.096,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.013,1745.533,"Yes, but in that case may not the trustee claim that is a preference?"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,1745.533,1751.671,"--The trustee may, and I realize that is a case working its way up to this Court."
1989.89-255,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.671,1752.289,It is here.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,1752.873,1757.741,Depending... and not decided yet.
1989.89-255,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.882,1923.834,"The tax law is full of irony, Mr. Moss."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,1944.764,1961.959,"I think the irony lies simply in examining the government's response along the continuum of the common law situation, at least as we view it."
1989.89-255,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.075,1997.899,"Suppose that the IRS is taking the position... let's assume they are... we don't have to treat anything the way you want and let you designate, that in fact we are the government."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2025.55,2035.139,I think the best response I can offer to that is the standard phrase it's a country of laws and not men.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2316.941,2318.976,But the debtor is somewhat different.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2328.664,2329.964,It is not.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.79,2447.409,"Let's break it down a minute, Mr. Moss."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2459.299,2470.607,Both plans provided that the priority tax payments would be paid over a period of time with interest.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2471.091,2471.857,Did they say anything about--
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2471.857,2473.476,"--One plan may have used four years, one six years."
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.476,2476.778,--Did they specify dates of payment?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2476.778,2477.361,Yes.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2483.582,2486.467,"Okay, but I'm not mentioning the government's objection right now."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2498.008,2503.578,--The penalty that attaches is the penalty that existed before the Chapter 11.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2511.518,2513.001,You've been backing in quite a bit.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2515.053,2515.636,--Okay.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.172,2526.028,Could the IRS apply to the bankruptcy court for an order requiring the debtor to pay according to the plan?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2526.028,2534.549,That depends on whether or not the bankruptcy court still has retained jurisdiction over the case.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.549,2536.232,"Well, what is the typical situation?"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2536.232,2536.682,The answer--
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.682,2539.167,What is the typical situation?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2539.167,2542.053,"--The typical situation, I am not sure there is one."
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.053,2543.488,"Well, what was the situation in these cases?"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2543.488,2549.107,The area of retained jurisdiction is an area that counsel will often focus upon carefully.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2576.709,2591.302,"Now, in those cases where the court has retained jurisdiction, could the IRS go to the court and say there is a payment due here that was not made, you tell the debtor to make it?"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2591.302,2594.338,I believe that that is possible for it to do.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.338,2600.741,That would be at least a different situation than the pre-bankruptcy.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2600.741,2609.763,"Well, it may and may not, because I think more typically what the Service would do is invoke its levy and seizure procedures."
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.763,2612.632,"Well, but supposing the Service chooses to do it this way."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2616.117,2625.273,"But in pre-bankruptcy I see no reason that a, the Internal Revenue Service could not go to a court of competent jurisdiction and ask for the same type of order."
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2625.273,2628.309,To order a taxpayer to pay?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2630.444,2631.861,Because money is owed.
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.323,2757.875,That's if it isn't scheduled.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2757.875,2773.969,"--It's quite important to the creditor, without question, but I don't think that this one piece of paper should be the touchstone between the court determining that this is a controlled or voluntary payment within the meaning of the common law--"
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2773.969,2794.215,"Could you... could you tell me, Mr. Moss, did the bankruptcy court indicate any reason for agreeing with the request to allocate these payments first to the trust fund taxes?"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2794.215,2795.315,"--Yes, in both--"
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.315,2803.488,And maybe another question is why did the debtor request it this way?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2803.488,2819.014,"--Well, as to the first question, I believe that the decisions in both cases and the record do suggest that the court took into account reasons for doing this."
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.014,2820.616,What are they?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2820.616,2828.555,"In the case of Newport, this was a plan funded by a third party."
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.582,2874.834,Because that provision would reduce their... would reduce their exposure.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2874.834,2875.786,--Yes.
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.944,2900.485,And so those are... that's really the reason in both of these cases that the debtor wants to have the tax payments applied in this way.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2900.485,2915.994,"Well, the debtor recognized, and it is worth noting that counsel for the debtor, by the way, is not counsel for the responsible officers, or you would never be appointed to that position at the start of the Chapter 11."
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2915.994,2916.946,Yes.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2916.946,2929.437,"Chapter 11 is an endless process of negotiation, and there are reasons, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, one, why these tradeoffs are requested."
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.904,2964.844,"But I take it it's really immaterial to the debtor, I suppose, how these payments are--"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,2964.844,2978.937,"No, it's... the government took the position that it is immaterial to creditors, and your question, which I would like to answer with that observation, says is it immaterial to the debtor."
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.023,3040.927,"--Well, after all, these taxes were deducted from peoples' paychecks, weren't they?"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3040.927,3041.41,Yes.
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.41,3047.348,And they were used before bankruptcy in a way that they shouldn't have been used for.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3047.348,3052.3,"That is correct, but in one sense that question asks if--"
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.3,3066.21,"I would think... I would think other creditors would have, would want to go after the officers rather than share the income of the company with... with the government."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3066.21,3068.577,--There is no basis for going after the officers.
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.395,3100.883,"Well, then if the government could have sued the... the Chapter 11 proceeding doesn't interfere with the government's right to sue the--"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3100.883,3101.516,--Not at all.
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.516,3103.335,--the officers immediately.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3103.335,3120.962,"Not at all, and that is precisely why, in the balancing of policies that we have argued in the brief, the tax policy, however quite important, we suggest is either not materially impaired, or at least is taken into account in other ways."
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3120.962,3128.2,Do you say there is no liability from the officers to the debtor for their having misappropriated the trust funds?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3128.2,3129.668,That's correct.
1989.89-255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3148.53,3149.614,Have you given us--
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3149.614,3151.748,--the taxes simply... net payroll was made.
1989.89-255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3151.748,3158.219,"--Mr. Moss, have you given us a specific reason why the officers should be taken off the hook?"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3158.219,3160.187,I am not asking that they be taken off the hook.
1989.89-255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3210.52,3212.639,Are you saying they are not taken off the hook?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3212.639,3213.372,--That is correct.
1989.89-255,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3213.372,3217.674,Their liability is eliminated to the extent the trust funds are used.
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3217.674,3225.114,"Well, it's... I'm sorry, it's a question of my being careful how I interpret your question."
1989.89-255,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3271.51,3277.914,What would happen if the IRS sued them immediately and got all the money from them?
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3291.472,3297.21,"What... no, I... that has been an interesting debate in a number of law firms."
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.037,3357.116,"That gets it out of the officers, and I would think the other creditors would want to have the plan revised, because it would enhance their ability to be paid in full if the government gets their taxes, their trust fund taxes out of the officers."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3357.116,3363.937,"The creditors might want that, but it doesn't mean that they... that they can have it."
1989.89-255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.758,3378.547,"Well can't the creditors usually profit from the fact that a debtor has a surety, has a guarantor?"
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3378.547,3379.68,"--No, not usually."
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3403.395,3404.514,"Thank you, Mr. Moss."
1989.89-255,1,25706,guy_b_moss,,3404.514,3405.331,Thank you.
1989.89-255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.331,3408.233,"Mr. Horowitz, you have two minutes remaining."
1989.89-255,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3408.233,3409.283,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-255,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.652,3442.472,"Well, excuse me, if you move to dismiss it for noncompliance, then you are back in the situation you were in pre-plan, I assume, right?"
1989.89-255,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3442.472,3443.106,That is right.
1989.89-255,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.106,3445.039,You have the same legal remedies under the statute that you had.
1989.89-255,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3445.039,3449.21,"Well, we would levy on them, and it would be an involuntary payment and we would apply it where we wanted."
1989.89-255,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3449.21,3450.126,It's not a very useful court order.
1989.89-255,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3457.732,3468.672,"And the protections against creditors are eliminated, which is the reason why the... don't forget Chapter 11 is a proceeding that is invoked by the debtor to protect themselves against creditors, not one that the IRS commences in order to collect."
1989.89-255,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3497.041,3497.624,"Well, that's not quite right."
1989.89-255,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3501.126,3503.476,--I understand it's not a discharge in the bankruptcy sense.
1989.89-255,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3503.476,3504.661,And it won't be discharged if it's not paid.
1989.89-255,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3509.63,3511.898,"Well, if all the taxes are paid, we have no complaint."
