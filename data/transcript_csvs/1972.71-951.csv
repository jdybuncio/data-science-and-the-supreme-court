1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.246,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-951, Almota Farmers Elevator against the United States."
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,24.087,28.394,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,116.336,119.525,And that how long did you say?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,119.525,122.449,"The date of taking was May 26, 1967."
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,125.545,126.396,But how?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,126.396,127.885,It had been a 20-year lease.
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,127.885,129.586,And had there been lease prior to that?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,129.586,129.822,Oh!
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,133.287,134.759,1919 that’s what --
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,134.759,136.775,"Consecutive, continuous."
1972.71-951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,136.775,138.341,Were they all 20-year leases or varied?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,138.341,140.445,"No, it started out with 5-year leases."
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.879,218.767,What does the lease provide with respect to those improvements at the term if the lease is not renewed?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,218.767,221.768,All through the period that these improvements were on there.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,282.242,292.997,"Now do you -- when you speak of the value of those improvements, are you speaking of their current use value or their salvage value to the lessee."
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,292.997,294.873,I’ll get to that point Mr. Chief Justice --
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,294.873,295.4,Very well.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,295.4,296.242,-- in just a moment.
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,318.039,326.521,"Under the law of your state, are those improvements part of the real estate?"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,326.521,336.286,"For the purpose of what the Government has to take, the Seagren case cited in our opening brief says, they are part of the real estate but under the law of the State of Washington and we cited authority for that."
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.885,363.774,"Well, I thought that -- well, perhaps you enlighten me."
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,379.234,381.664,That is the argument of the Government.
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,385.172,387.335,Right.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,389.207,398.265,Judge Powell in the District Court in Spokane.
1972.71-951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.107,425.894,"Mr. Hickman, there is no dispute is there that upon the Government’s taking, your client is obligated to sever the improvements that he can’t leave them in place and continue to use them."
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,425.894,430.338,He had no legal right to continue to use them in place.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,451.858,457.72,"Well, they have a right to use them under the lease for seven more years approximately."
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,457.72,459.304,That is right.
1972.71-951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.304,467.003,"While in the condemnation vested full right in the Government, did it not subject to the obligation to pay just compensation?"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,467.003,476.7,"Yes, the vested full right in the leasehold and the improvements but mind, the Government did not condemn the rights of the fee owner."
1972.71-951,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.984,489.669,So you said that the Government couldn’t insist under the way it took the land that you remove those buildings just because --
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,489.669,496.479,The Government had no right to insist because the Government was not acquiring the fee.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,508.166,512.711,"Well, it is now taken."
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,517.328,520.821,"No, the fee owner was not joined in this case."
1972.71-951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,529.826,532.363,I’m confused as others apparently are.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,537.961,540.015,"Well, of course it is not a part of the record."
1972.71-951,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,563.638,565.806,"Yes, but what was the Government’s purpose?"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,568.883,572.681,"For the Little Goose Lock and Dam project, it would be flooded."
1972.71-951,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.681,575.469,And why would the leasehold just be enough for that?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,575.469,579.828,"Well, they expected to acquire the fee by making a deal with the railroad but they hadn’t made the deal yet."
1972.71-951,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,579.828,583.621,You mean by a negotiated purchase?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,583.621,584.207,That’s right.
1972.71-951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,584.207,585.746,Or by trading and relocation.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,585.746,590.713,"That’s right, they relocated the railroad higher up on the hill and went ahead."
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,593.916,601.581,"If they just before you proceed, if the Government had first acquired the fee, you would hardly have any case at all would you?"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,605.293,614.868,"Your Honor, I would agree with you because the Government then would have had the right at the end of term to say, “Sorry boys, we’re not going to renew but the thing is we have to take the facts in this case as they are.”"
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,643.983,653.495,"And did that in turn, that difference in turn in valuation depend upon whether or not consideration was given to the possibility of renewal of the lease?"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,653.495,656.611,"Actually, it ultimately boils down to that."
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,904.523,922.254,What if the railroad somewhere toward the end of the seven years remaining in the lease decided for their own reasons to move the track to high ground if in case of flooding or move it anywhere else?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,922.254,925.831,"Your Honor, that is one of the risks that any buyer takes."
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,925.831,926.288,Well the buyer or the --
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,926.288,934.393,You buy a few property for example and you take the risks that the party between you and the view might build a high rise apartment.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,934.393,934.842,Isn’t that a risk?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,934.842,934.864,"It is a risk, yes."
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,934.864,939.864,Isn’t that a risk that your client took when he built the property on that land under that lease?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,939.864,946.227,Yes but the thing is Your Honor that Government here would have this value the thought was a certainty.
1972.71-951,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.774,1013.655,The -- if the lease have had in a clause that automatically terminated the lease if the property was condemned.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1013.655,1031.498,"Your talking of a problem there Your Honor that doesn’t apply in this case, there was no condemnation clause in the lease and Almota in this case by -- is entitled to the full value of these structures, whatever it may be."
1972.71-951,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1032.217,1043.079,"Mr. Hickman, did I understand you correctly to say that at the time of the commencement of the condemnation case that railroad still own the fee?"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1043.079,1044.807,That is absolutely correct Your Honor.
1972.71-951,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1048.955,1069.177,"Well I have before me, I think the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which says prior to the commencement of the condemnation action under review, the United States had settled with the fee owner, the railroad for the railroads interest in the land in question."
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1069.177,1074.219,I realize that that is in the opinion and there’s been some contention of that type in some of the briefs.
1972.71-951,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1074.219,1074.628,Is it your position that --
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1074.628,1076.235,It’s absolutely no truth to it.
1972.71-951,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1093.866,1094.142,Is the record --
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1094.142,1098.528,"That did not happen as I just mentioned to you, they don’t yet own the fee."
1972.71-951,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1098.528,1100.98,"Mr. Hickman, is the record silent on this issue?"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1100.98,1102.016,It is.
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1134.141,1142.897,"Well, had the Government acquired the fee thereby condemnation or negotiation, it would have been certain that the lease would not have been renewed and --"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1142.897,1145.364,Well now except for this Your Honor.
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1157.896,1158.721,Right.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1158.721,1164.331,And the trial judge was of the opinion that the Government can’t assert the detriments of it either.
1972.71-951,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1164.331,1165.055,I think that’s correct.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1165.055,1171.239,In other words that they have got to take the title as it was at the time they are taking this and at that time the Government didn’t own it.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1323.013,1328.311,Where most of these buildings put up since 1954 or a large portion of them?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1328.311,1335.566,The concrete tank was put up about 1954 and the rest have been put up about 1940 and the flat house about 1919.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1335.566,1341.227,The most expensive piece I suppose is the concrete tank?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1341.227,1341.968,Not necessarily.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1341.968,1345.049,But it’s the one on which you have the lease salvage.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1345.049,1346.371,"Well, there’s no salvage to that."
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1346.371,1348.7,In any of it really?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1348.7,1349.167,Really not.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1355.254,1365.518,Well is this perhaps the explanation why the earlier leases were five years for example and the final lease is --
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1365.518,1366.48,I think not Your Honor.
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1372.723,1380.234,Would a prudent business man in 1954 go to the expensive building that concrete tank if he had only a five-year lease?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1380.234,1382.945,"Your Honor, that’s just the point I’m trying to make."
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1401.869,1404.711,Well that’s not quite the question I was driving at.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1417.036,1418.196,He’d want something more than that --
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1418.196,1420.343,So he got a 20-year lease the last time?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1420.343,1426.468,He would do it with the railroad and the type of lease as it was being written and has done quite regularly.
1972.71-951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1461.404,1468.365,"Mr. Hickman, it may be of no consequence but the annual rental under release was 114.20 a year?"
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1468.365,1471.046,That’s right.
1972.71-951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1471.046,1473.986,Had it always been at that figure?
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1473.986,1475.479,"Here, it never had been more than that."
1972.71-951,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1478.102,1482.007,A typical nominal railroad lease.
1972.71-951,0,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,1482.007,1483.169,"That’s right, that’s right."
1972.71-951,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.72,1551.518,Very well Mr. Hickman.
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,1555.076,1561.213,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.648,1796.239,"Mr. Frizzell, you refer to this holding and Petty as to the expectancies of a tenant for years."
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,1801.261,1803.745,We discussed it in our brief further than merely in a footnote.
1972.71-951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1803.745,1803.901,No.
1972.71-951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.871,1842.694,"It isn’t a part of the holding and the same in fact that you -- in Petty that you defense its cause of removal and replacement, relocation, isn’t that the same -- doesn’t it have the same plight?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,1842.694,1843.363,I’m sorry.
1972.71-951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.942,1845.363,I’m sorry.
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,1847.055,1855.576,"May I, Mr. Justice, may I bring your attention to page 381, the page following the footnote that you refer to."
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1884.298,1897.284,"When the Court used the language the right to use the -- to renew the lease of Petty, do you say the Court meant a right which is a legal right enforceable under some option?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,1897.284,1900.754,And that was the instance with that one defendant in Petty.
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.736,1912.806,"My preference is not to expectancy or hope or custom of renewing the lease independent of some option to renew, is it?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,1912.806,1913.414,Not at all.
1972.71-951,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2022.281,2025.219,We all take it that it could rule against it without doing that?
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2025.219,2027.266,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1972.71-951,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2028.277,2040.899,"If may with a decision to this Court had cited but only in the footnote in your brief, United States against Virginia Electric and Power Company in volume 365 of the United States reports?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2040.899,2042.878,I am not Your Honor.
1972.71-951,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2042.878,2056.507,In that case the Court held that the valuation of an easement would depend upon evaluating the likelihood of its being exercised.
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2070.929,2074.684,An easement would be a legal interest properly compensation.
1972.71-951,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2074.684,2075.9,"Well I know, but yes."
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2107.324,2123.236,"Let’s turn our attention because it’s a logical question and a logical interest to take and that is how does the Government justify the petitioner in this instance getting something less than the $274,000."
1972.71-951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2314.691,2315.879,Mr. Frizzell.
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2315.879,2316.193,Yes.
1972.71-951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2316.193,2317.796,May I go back to your illustration.
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2335.271,2349.181,"Had they in fact acquired more than 7-1/2 year lease, 20-year, whatever, we would have had to pay them for their legal interest in the property condemned the leasehold interest but not any expectancy."
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2349.181,2355.02,Would that necessarily be true if they acquire that 20-year extension after notice of the taking?
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2355.02,2355.556,No.
1972.71-951,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2394.532,2396.949,"And at the date of trial, they didn’t have?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2396.949,2397.865,"No, sir."
1972.71-951,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.865,2402.002,"In this appeal, they didn’t have it?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2402.002,2406.263,I think not.
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2406.263,2410.481,"Well, how should we weigh that circumstance?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2419.625,2420.908,That is not in the record.
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2459.612,2463.837,And that taking was effective as of that --
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2463.837,2464.868,As of that date.
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2464.868,2468.239,And the money deposited in the usual way?
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2468.239,2469.34,Yes.
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2469.34,2475.583,"But the monthly deposit, it is the 130,000 or the smaller of the two stipulated in us."
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2475.583,2476.67,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-951,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2476.67,2492.86,"Mr. Frizzell how was the settlement between the Government and the railroad evidenced, was there contract?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2492.86,2497.247,The specific information I have here Mr. Justice.
1972.71-951,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2528.574,2530.59,Is that information in the record?
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2530.59,2530.933,"No, sir."
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2536.857,2538.77,Let me back up that Mr. Frizzell.
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2544.371,2545.476,Yes.
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2545.476,2547.215,And that is of record and in this record?
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2547.215,2549.387,Indeed it is.
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.387,2553.661,"So as of that date, the title passed?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2553.661,2555.431,"As between petitioner and the Government, yes."
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2555.431,2558.046,"The leasehold interest, whatever is valued --"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2558.046,2589.746,"Whatever that interest is, whatever its value is passed to the Government as of May of 1967 leaving a remaining approximately 7-1/2 year term for the Government to compensate petitioner for under his original 20-year lease dating back to 1954 and expiring in 1974."
1972.71-951,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2641.239,2648.66,I understand your position that practically you can remove them except to a junk.
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2648.66,2664.067,"I would submit that that would generally be true with most permanent type of improvements after 13 years since their -- this were erected in 1940, some of them I think is said."
1972.71-951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.47,2678.929,As if maybe in a code word or the Government saying that we will assist to get along.
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2678.929,2686.015,This lease provided by the way that if petitioner didn’t remove them that the railroad had the right to do so and charge petitioner.
1972.71-951,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.015,2688.707,"Yes, and you could do the same."
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2688.707,2693.787,"Yes, as we exceed to the rights of the fee railroad owner."
1972.71-951,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2693.787,2704.492,"Mr. Frizzell, do you think there is any basic inconsistency between the Ninth Circuit decisions in this case and in the Fuller case, preceding one?"
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2704.492,2743.987,"Well, we and I disagree with the Ninth Circuit decision in the Fuller case but of course as you well know since it’s just been argued that is different to the extent that in that instance the expectancy was based on a license revocable by the Government whereas in this instance, there was no renewal right in the lease but a mere expectancy that petitioner desires to rise to the level of a legal interest in the lease and therefore be compensated."
1972.71-951,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2793.078,2799.939,What types of damages were being referred to under the head of consequential damages Mr. Justice Douglas’s opinion there?
1972.71-951,1,33823,kent_frizzell,,2799.939,2814.198,That was an instance where General Motors Corporation desired to remove leasehold improvements in the matter of machinery and buildings.
1972.71-951,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2814.198,2815.467,Thank you Mr. Frizzell.
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,2819.016,2827.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, about the Petty case, we’ve dealt with that at length in the briefs and the preferences made to that I think that the matter is fully answered."
1972.71-951,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2890.247,2894.658,Isn’t that seven or 7-1/2 years used?
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,2894.658,2903.257,"That’s not limited by the 7-1/2 years because as I have pointed out, at the end of the 7-1/2 years we still own these buildings."
1972.71-951,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2907.648,2909.933,"Well, that’s what you said earlier didn’t you?"
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,2909.933,2913.725,I said that if you took their view they would be worth nothing.
1972.71-951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.198,2929.384,Because of renewal -- because of the probability of renewal.
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,2929.384,2933.534,Because of the probability of continuing to use them right where they are.
1972.71-951,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2977.268,2982.874,Isn’t that quotation you read from directed primarily at the highest and best used concept?
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,2982.874,2992.385,"Well, coming to the highest and best used concept, what is the highest and best used of this particular elevator at the end of the term to use it right where it is, isn’t it?"
1972.71-951,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3031.343,3044.764,"Under your theory Mr. Hickman, could a witness testify that condemnation -- the valuation hearing that your client have had a falling out with the railroad and therefore in this particular case it was very unlikely that the lease would be renewed?"
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,3044.764,3046.787,I suppose it would be pertinent.
1972.71-951,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.019,3063.578,What if the United States (Inaudible) and says we’re going to take this fee obviously and we’ll guarantee we’ll never renew it within the seven years.
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,3063.578,3079.075,"Gentlemen of the Court, if you feel in this case that this matter of whether the Government own the fee in this or did not own it is the crux of this case, then this case should be remanded to try that matter of fact in the trial court."
1972.71-951,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3105.097,3122.301,"What difference does that really make Mr. Hickman when there was a separate taking of the leasehold interest in 1967, a proceeding directed only at your client and at the interest of your client which was then7-1/2 years?"
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,3122.301,3125.848,"Well, the thing is that at the end of the --"
1972.71-951,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3125.848,3129.156,Who cares in other words where the fee title was at that time?
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,3129.156,3131.467,"Well, it has to do with the probability of renewal."
1972.71-951,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3142.695,3146.933,"That’s what Justice White was suggesting to you, wasn’t it in his question?"
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,3146.933,3150.039,"Well, then if there is it would be probability of a renewal, would there?"
1972.71-951,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3161.323,3162.361,Mr. Hickman.
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,3162.361,3163.057,Yes.
1972.71-951,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3163.057,3171.716,The agreed facts state that the property was being acquired for public use in connection with the dam project.
1972.71-951,2,34556,lawrence_earl_hickman,,3179.814,3183.638,The record is silent on that but for what benefit it may be to you.
1972.71-951,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3199.621,3201.279,Thank you gentleman.
