1985.84-978,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.228,"Mr. Gribbon, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,58.228,60.852,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.888,255.445,"Mr. Gribbon, I think the Solicitor General in a brief filed with us takes the position that is neither yours nor the appellee's."
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,264.177,267.269,"I will comment on it right now, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.694,336.099,I don't understand that last statement.
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,344.191,364.758,"--All payments made by the state itself are regarded as payment of claims, because there is a New Jersey Environmental Department that submits claims to the Treasurer's Department and the Treasurer then pays them, so that New Jersey does not recognize this distinction that the Solicitor General purports to see between paying claims for third parties and doing the work yourself."
1985.84-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.977,375.365,"Well, I suppose it's also possible to argue that what the statute means is pre-empted."
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,400.652,402.121,"Your Honor, we would agree with that interpretation."
1985.84-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.069,428.595,"But if there is a site in New Jersey that isn't on the priority list of the federal government and of EPA, then you would think the state could make its--"
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,428.595,445.681,"Could tax chemical and oil and make a payment, except for sites that are on the National Contingency Plan, an earlier list where removal without any kind of approval from EPA can be compensated under EPA, and a lot of the expenses of the State of New Jersey are removal expenses."
1985.84-978,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,466.906,477.823,"--Mr. Gribbon, along the line of your answers, what if the federal government pays claims to the state, perhaps would pay."
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,497.362,499.019,"Yes, that is correct."
1985.84-978,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,508.297,512.044,"Well, assume that the claims do qualify for federal payment."
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,515.622,516.903,"Well, to some extent it does."
1985.84-978,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,524.773,527.991,Because the federal government has paid the claims?
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,527.991,533.364,It may be because the federal government has paid 90 percent of the cost of cleaning up sites in New Jersey.
1985.84-978,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,543.891,544.953,"You said ""maybe""."
1985.84-978,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,547.374,550.358,It shows the $25 million accumulation.
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,1318.063,1326.436,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.163,2085.896,May I just interrupt a moment.
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2091.331,2094.158,Section--
1985.84-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2094.158,2101.984,"Section 114-A, for example, doesn't that just apply to state action that could well be financed by general tax revenues instead of from the special fund?"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2101.984,2104.42,--I don't believe it's limited to just--
1985.84-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.42,2106.606,"Maybe it's not limited, but at least it would be effective."
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2106.606,2109.184,"--It would be effective as to those, yes."
1985.84-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.184,2123.13,"Because, I have to confess, this language, does the New Jersey Spill Fund provide money to clean up damages that could be compensated under the federal Act?"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2123.13,2129.034,Not as interpreted and applied subsequent to the adoption of Section 114-C.
1985.84-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.761,2188.729,"What do you mean by ""realistically eligible""?"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2198.195,2220.638,"While there is a possibility, a reasonable possibility that the money will be forthcoming... for example, if EPA says to New Jersey in regard to a particular site, it's on the national priority list but we don't have enough money to go around, therefore we cannot fund this site, at that point the state could step in and use its state fund."
1985.84-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.72,2259.684,"Would you explain to me once, I know you have got it in your brief but I have a little trouble following it, why isn't 114-C duplicative of 114-B under your present argument?"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2259.684,2264.043,"Well, it comes right out of the argument I've just made."
1985.84-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.287,2282.924,"Well, if the chance is good enough so that you actually get the money, then 114-B would prohibit the--"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2282.924,2284.956,114-B and also 114-C.
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.572,2316.162,--Are you defending the decision below and all of its ramifications?
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2316.162,2327.61,"--We have taken the actual compensation part of the decision below and have given it what we feel to be a practical application, and so we start at the same thing."
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.61,2337.247,Didn't the court below say that New Jersey is pre-empted only in those instances where Superfund actually pays something?
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2337.247,2341.885,"They use the terms ""actual compensation""."
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.885,2343.854,Do you defend that?
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2343.854,2350.087,We defend the actual compensation test as given in a practical way.
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2350.087,2365.441,"Any other claim, New Jersey may go right ahead as long as Superfund hasn't actually paid even though there is a realistic chance that it might?"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2365.441,2368.221,We would differ at the point.
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.402,2390.821,"So, you do request us to put quite a gloss on... if we agree with you, we must put quite a gloss on the New Jersey Supreme Court's opinion?"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2390.821,2394.881,"A gloss in terms of how you practically apply it, yes."
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.381,2399.912,Do you think we are in a position really to do that?
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2403.239,2405.285,"Yes, we have made this argument from--"
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.285,2408.377,I would have thought you would have made the argument that they bought.
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2408.377,2418.076,"--We think this is just an extension of their argument and one, frankly, that gives it a practical application."
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.09,2421.371,"It's a narrowing or their argument, isn't it?"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2421.371,2426.088,--It goes beyond their argument.
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.088,2437.927,"It sounds to me like... the New Jersey court, it seems to me, gave the State of New Jersey much more freedom than you say, that you now ask for."
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2437.927,2467.274,"Except, the New Jersey court did not address how the test was to be applied, although they did suggest at page 35 in the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement, that Congress contemplated that the federal government would attempt to deal with the problems of the most seriously affected sites and to allow states to maintain a compensation fund or to use general revenues should they choose, to conduct their own cleanup efforts on those sites not receiving Superfund compensation."
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.006,2480.16,"Do you agree, may not a state be a claimant under the Superfund program?"
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2480.16,2486.314,--The state is the claimant under the Superfund program for natural resource damages only.
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.9,2508.789,Suppose a state goes ahead and cleans up a site.
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2511.163,2515.911,The federal fund had not been operated that way by EPA.
1985.84-978,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.421,2532.327,I see.
1985.84-978,1,36092,mary_carol_jacobson,,2548.632,2560.799,"Relying upon the review of state statutes that Exxon has included in its brief, our statute does seem to be different from other statutes."
1985.84-978,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3107.048,3108.001,Very well.
1985.84-978,2,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,3108.829,3110.811,"If you please, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.985,3235.402,"Mr. Gribbon, on that, right on that point, in your view could they have a special fund raised from the oil and chemical companies just to finance their ten percent share of--"
1985.84-978,2,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,3235.402,3236.526,I think they could.
1985.84-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.526,3239.698,--But that's hard to square with the language--
1985.84-978,2,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,3239.698,3241.917,That doesn't qualify.
1985.84-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3246.321,3250.07,"--But if you're looking at the purpose of the money, it's to clean up things that are eligible."
1985.84-978,2,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,3250.07,3256.27,"Legislative action frequently is not complete, and this was done in an awful hurry."
1985.84-978,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3288.773,3292.381,"Thank you, counsel."
