1976.76-777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,87.287,"We'll hear arguments next in 76-777, Connor v. Finch and the related cases that are consolidated for arguments."
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,90.292,93.918,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.457,308.249,"And why is this, what provision of the Constitution?"
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,308.249,313.546,"This is applicable in Chapman v. Meier, the Court laid down standards applicable for the court-ordered --"
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.546,315.095,But it is the Constitution that lays down standards.
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,315.095,315.902,That is correct.
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,315.902,316.772,What provision of the Constitution?
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,316.772,318.21,"Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause."
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,318.21,325.94,"Equal Protection, so is this a Reynolds against Sims-type case, or is it a Gomillion against Lightfoot-type case?"
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,327.652,329.865,The case involves both issues.
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.502,347.941,"There is only been, I think, one case in this Court involving the impact of the Fifteenth Amendment on the electoral franchise, hasn’t there?"
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,347.941,351.076,"Well, we believe that White versus Regester also involved the Fifteenth Amendment."
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,351.076,352.17,Did it say so?
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,352.17,352.983,Yes.
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.983,353.659,It did say so?
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,354.861,360.367,"I believe it did, Your Honor, because it involved dilution of minority voting strength in Dallas and Baylor Counties in Texas."
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,360.367,363.118,I thought that was a Fourteenth Amendment case.
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,363.118,373.902,"Well, of course, the Court has failed to distinguish between Equal Protection of the Fourteenth Amendment as it prohibits racial discrimination and the Fifteenth Amendment as it prohibits racial discrimination and the right to vote."
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.712,380.853,"Well, Reynolds v. Sims and that whole lot of cases has nothing to do with racial discrimination."
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,380.853,381.435,That is correct.
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,384.959,388.72,And a case like Gomillion against Lightfoot has everything to do with the Fifteenth Amendment...
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,388.72,389.225,That is correct.
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.225,391.166,Except for Mr. Justice Whitaker’s concurrence.
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,391.166,392.76,That is right.
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,392.76,393.374,That is right?
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,393.374,393.795,That is correct.
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.795,400.548,"And my question is, which amendments of the Constitution are at issue here?"
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,400.548,411.366,"When we say that the District Court’s plan is excessively malapportioned, that involves the Reynolds v. Sims and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as is relates to population disparities."
1976.76-777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,428.104,437.499,Is it your contention that it was incumbent upon the District Court under the Fifteenth Amendment to maximize black voting strength?
1976.76-777,0,24466,frank_r_parker,,437.499,438.954,"No, that is not our contention."
1976.76-777,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1390.414,1394.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.76-777,2,17068,a_f_summer,,2601.962,2609.297,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,3801.746,3807.569,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4180.997,4185.926,"That issue here, that fact, is just relevant to the dilution argument, I take it."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4185.926,4189.089,That fact is relevant to the dilution argument.
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4189.089,4193.854,But not to the population-variance argument.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4193.854,4196.792,"That's correct, Justice White."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4196.792,4202.564,"Now, are you addressing all these arguments together, or are you going to separate them?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4205.075,4209.841,My argument relates to the racial dilution and the affirmative gerrymandering.
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4214.3,4231.898,"Well, I'm just wondering on the variance, the population-variance issue, what is your submission or is there any limit to the population variation that you might claim to be justified by following county lines?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4231.898,4235.503,"There must be, let me point out one small exception."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4235.503,4246.213,"Well, is the State submission here that none of the county line breaking should be countenance that everywhere the District Court broke a county line, that should be reversed?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4246.213,4247.082,"No, it is not, Justice White."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4247.082,4248.549,"Well, then, what is it arguing in that respect?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4248.549,4259.971,"Our point is that if there is to be any fracturing whatsoever, it should be de minimis and only when the cloth runs out; and that's what happened in the '75 plan."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4260.072,4267.09,"Well, when does the cloth run out, when do you get to such a population variation that you have to break a county line?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4267.09,4269.622,"Well, the population variation."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4269.622,4271.607,"Do you make a submission on that, or don't you?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4271.607,4274.163,"I would make a submission, yes."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4284.762,4285.721,And that's not enough.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4285.721,4292.125,"And I would say that's not enough.and it's off the dilution argument, but let me follow up and say why."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4327.472,4331.034,"I take it, then, do you support the '75 plan right across the board or not?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4331.034,4337.103,"Yes, we do, Justice White, and we would ask this Court and I will in my closing will point that out."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4338.841,4342.495,"And you say it's a Fourteenth Amendment Case, not a Fifteenth?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4342.495,4345.981,"Yes, I do."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4345.981,4348.514,"Well, was the Fifteenth Amendment relied on this case."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4348.514,4349.035,"No, it was not."
1976.76-777,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4349.035,4351.688,By the plaintiffs?
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4351.688,4355.096,I believe the plaintiffs so stated this morning.
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4498.676,4515.063,"Mr. Leonard, getting to the present, as I understand, the other side says that the lines have been drawn in the last few years have effectively diluted the vote of the Negro."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4515.063,4516.112,That is right.
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4516.112,4517.955,"Well, that's not past."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4518.941,4523.831,"Justice Marshall, that's not the finding of the District Court in this case."
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4523.831,4525.936,"Well, what plan is he talking about?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4525.936,4528.062,"I do not know, but the District Court --"
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4528.062,4529.25,"Well, you heard his --"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4529.25,4532.233,"I heard him, the District Court made extensive findings."
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4533.721,4542.162,"Well, extensive findings that Negroes are not denied the right to vote means nothing to this case."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4542.162,4543.66,"Justice Marshall, I can only tell you that --"
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4543.66,4544.579,"I mean, of course, they can vote."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4544.579,4561.812,"The '75 court plan provides for 14 Senators that will be elected from populations with over 55% black; 30 Representatives from the House, a total of 76, as the Attorney General pointed out."
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4561.812,4567.326,What about the way Hinds County was broken up?
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4567.326,4571.348,"That's part of the Hinds County case, which has been affirmed by the Fifth Circuit thus far."
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4571.348,4573.051,Is it here?
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4573.051,4574.01,It is not here.
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4574.01,4576.191,It is not here.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4576.191,4577.75,"You mean, is it involved in this case?"
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4577.75,4578.332,Yes.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4578.332,4583.889,"Yes, because it was incorporated in the Hinds County apportionment was incorporated here."
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4583.889,4586.437,It is recent; that is not ancient history.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4586.437,4591.413,"Justice Marshall, what I am trying to point out is that the Fifth Circuit affirmed Judge Nixon."
1976.76-777,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4616.202,4623.781,"But, Mr. Leonard, is it not correct that they've been approved only with respect to the numerical problem, not the dilution problem?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4623.781,4630.788,"No, I believe Judge Nixon addressed the dilution problem in the Kirksey decision, and as did the Fifth Circuit in affirming."
1976.76-777,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4630.788,4634.173,"And the Fifth Circuit addressed the dilution problem, did it?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4634.173,4648.699,"It addressed the racial-discrimination problem, whether it was raised in the terms of the dilution, the point is, the issue of racial discrimination by virtue of dilution and the apportionment of the County was raised."
1976.76-777,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4648.699,4654.87,"Let me just ask one other question, so that I can find the answer in the written materials that are quite voluminous."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4674.318,4682.306,"I believe, Justice Stevens, that the explanation is that because, as Attorney General Summer pointed out."
1976.76-777,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4741.631,4752.733,"But is there anything in the written materials, including anything the District Court said, which explains why the lines were drawn in Hinds County the way they were?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4752.733,4773.596,"My recollection, Justice Stevens, is that the District Court in 396 addressed all of those issues, including the apportionment of Hinds, Harrison and Jackson County, and why it made the choices that it did."
1976.76-777,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4773.596,4775.975,There is nothing in your briefs on that precise point.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4775.975,4781.983,I think that there is not on that precise point.
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4855.344,4865.233,"Mr. Leonard, what do you do about a case a little while ago, United States v. Classic, said that although the man wasn't denied the right to participate, his vote was not counted?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4866.397,4869.262,"Well, if his vote wasn't counted because the election officials are corrupt."
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4869.262,4877.474,"It said it had to be a meaningful vote, that is what Classic said and that was about 30 years ago."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4877.474,4887.661,"Justice Marshall, I think that the proof in this case indicates that the blacks not only participate, but they are a political power in the State of Mississippi."
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4887.661,4891.882,And they have how many people in the Legislature?
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4891.882,4903.504,"They have 4 members of a 122-member House this time; but there is historical reasons for that, and that is that the blacks did not participate in the party elections prior to 1970."
1976.76-777,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4903.504,4905.531,"Another historical reason, too."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,4905.531,4928.175,"Yes, this Court said in White v. Regester that there must be a showing of invidious discrimination that excludes minorities from the political process by a practice of slating of candidates, which was the practice in Texas, so that they were unable to gain access to the party primaries."
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5169.549,5171.416,You have about four minutes left.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5210.147,5213.146,If a court-ordered plan both.
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5213.146,5214.015,"Well, any, any plan."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5214.015,5219.63,Both conform perform to one person-one vote and also provide a proportional representation.
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5223.572,5226.292,"Well, wouldn’t that be the acme of perfection, then?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5226.292,5228.796,"Yes, it would not be unconstitutional."
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5228.796,5233.688,"It would certainly dilute some of the voting strength, wouldn’t it?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5233.688,5238.508,Not if it provided proportional representation to all interest groups.
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5238.508,5240.328,Has the Court now ordered proportionally representation?
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5240.328,5243.66,"No, and we do not insist upon that in this case."
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5243.66,5248.735,"Well, lay aside proportional representation, which is not in this case, as I understand it."
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5248.735,5255.234,You mean that if every legislative district was 37% black and 63% white?
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5258.754,5259.505,It wouldn’t be adequate.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5259.505,5260.235,It would not be adequate.
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5280.218,5285.396,I thought you were prepared to concede that that was the acme of perfection.
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5285.396,5289.803,"Not if every legislative district was 37% black, no, not at all."
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5293.329,5304.644,"How are the courts going to reach the subjective attitudes of the voters, either Negro or white, in terms of how they should vote?"
1976.76-777,3,31565,jerris_leonard,,5307.376,5310.565,"That's in the evidence of this case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.76-777,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5440.161,5440.99,Thank you gentlemen.
