1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.891,"Thank you, gentlemen."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,43.948,47.155,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1981.80-1082,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.414,125.519,Would you say that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Judge Pierce's grant of habeas corpus in the District Court on the same grounds?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,125.519,128.434,"No, completely -- I would think it's a completely different ground."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,155.916,160.123,"You mean, the Court of Appeals, in fact took a per se standard?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,160.123,160.62,"Yes, I believe they did."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,160.62,165.053,And you say Judge Pierce implied bias was not the same?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,165.266,170.301,I -- I think it is different.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.095,282.838,When -- when did the trial prosecutor learned of that letter?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,282.838,284.47,In -- in the middle of the trial.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.47,285.3,In the middle of the trial.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,285.3,286.029,That is correct.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.029,290.269,"And at that time, do I understand that there were several alternates?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,290.269,290.541,"Yes, there were."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.541,294.494,And have this been brought to the attention under the trial judge?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,299.441,300.881,It would have been up to the discretion of a --
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.881,301.058,Whether he would or not.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,301.058,301.993,-- trial judge.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.993,302.989,"No, but he might have."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,302.989,303.628,"Yes, he could have."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,303.628,305.016,There were four alternates.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,305.016,308.267,I believe that is correct.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.267,312.768,"Well, isn't that really the key fact in this whole case?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,312.768,331.049,"Well, if you -- it seems to me that under New York -- if you look under New York law at the time, even today, the judge would have discretion provided he found the juror actually biased, will be actually influence, and that discretion is -- is virtually unreviewable as it is in federal court."
1981.80-1082,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,331.049,333.208,You didn't say he had discretion if there had been actual bias.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,333.208,338.945,"No, no -- if he -- no, but in other words, in making that determination, it would give great weight to him if you found actual --"
1981.80-1082,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,338.945,340.722,"But we found actual bias, you would have been (Voice Overlap)"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,340.722,342.289,"That is correct, yes."
1981.80-1082,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.981,362.184,"But then -- then he would have risk, I suppose, if the defense hadn't consented to it a charge of double jeopardy if he tried to go ahead with the trial."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,362.184,370.455,"The -- the exact scope of the Double Jeopardy Clause in that -- in that context, I'm not sure of whether -- whether it would bar a subsequent trial."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,370.455,381.635,"Do you mean that in New York, if a juror is excused and replaced by an alternate juror, that gives rise to a double jeopardy point?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,381.635,383.861,"No, I do not believe -- I don't think it does."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,383.861,400.677,"Well, if the judge is given this information at that time and he didn't find that this man was bias, he could still have removed him, am I right?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,400.677,406.399,"I --I think a reading of -- of the State, if he found that he was not bias, I don't think the judge could have removed him under New York law at that time."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,406.399,408.924,He had to be -- he was actual bias?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,408.924,411.133,I believe that's correct under the law at that time.
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,411.133,412.476,"You give me that case, I'd like to see it."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,412.476,423.181,I believe -- I believe that will be the way I would read CPL Sections 270.35.
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,423.181,423.533,Which one?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,423.533,435.548,Criminal Procedure Law Section 270.35(2) which is repeated in -- on page 28 of our brief.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.548,451.093,"Now, I find that the Second Circuit agrees thought that is a matter of a federal Constitution that -- that situation does not require a determination of actual bias, isn't that right?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,451.093,452.912,It's not clear what --
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.912,459.77,"Well, in any event, surely, the Second Circuit did not follow as you have now described it to New York law, did it?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,459.77,471.593,"No, they don't really discuss it and say, it's good light, we hear the judge would have removed him and consequently, the defendant was denied -- the respondent was denied a fair trial, that's all it said."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.593,473.115,But how do you understand that?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,476.828,477.644,"Well, I think this --"
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.644,478.231,-- under New York?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,478.231,483.795,"At least under New York law, they would be suggesting there's a good chance that judge would have found him actual bias, they'll remove him."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.795,485.582,Is that what you think they said?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,485.582,491.333,"Well, if they were saying that he would exercise a discretion, then I don't think he has to remove the juror then, I don't -- I don't think that they'll --"
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.333,501.283,"Well, surely, I thought there was a difference between how you construe the New York rule and the way the Second Circuit looked at it, isn't it?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,501.283,502.379,I'm not sure I understand you correctly there sir.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.379,509.284,"Well, surely, the standard applied by the Second Circuit is different from the one that you suggest as the New York rule."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,509.284,511.427,I don't think they applied any standard at all.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.835,532.323,"Well, they say, and we reverse because we think that fact circumstance establishes a violation to the federal constitution."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,532.323,533.748,"Well, if -- yes."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.923,542.942,"I don't know that they even trust him, whether he was in fact biased."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,542.942,552.387,"Well, but if he -- if he is not -- if he is not bias, it's -- it's hard for me to see what constitute -- constitutional right would be violated by the prosecutor."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.387,557.784,"Well, they say just as a matter of per se, that conduct per se was a violation of the federal constitution."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,557.784,559.867,The application for the job.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.867,561.993,And know the knowledge of the prosecutor.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,561.993,562.206,Well -- but --
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.206,564.724,And -- and his failure to disclose it for the trial judge.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,564.724,569.772,But unless the prosecutor's failure prejudices the defendant in some way.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.707,577.978,"Well, the Court of Appeals said you do get a reversal."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,577.978,579.848,That was why -- that's why they're wrong.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.848,581.131,That's why the case is here.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,581.131,583.761,I believe that is why the case is here.
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,583.761,584.562,Mr. Pitler -- (Voice Overlap) –
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,584.562,584.567,Thank you Justice White.
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,584.567,603.146,"-- as the Second Circuit holding amount to reading the word “may” in 270.352 where the provision is the Court may, in the circumstances, may if an alternate juror is available to discharge the juror."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,610.345,611.83,"Well, this is really --"
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,611.83,614.276,That's exactly the Second Circuit holding.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,614.276,618.811,"Yes, but I think they -- if the judge -- the answer to your question is yes."
1981.80-1082,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.273,667.785,"Well, Mr. Pitler, in the case of the application of 270.35, if the judge determines somewhere in the course of the trial that a juror is actually bias and says, “I'm going to remove this juror and substitute an alternate.”"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,673.656,675.445,No -- no it would not.
1981.80-1082,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,691.115,703.133,"Well, but then -- then, wouldn't the defendant have a right to argue on appeal under New York Courts that the judge improperly applied the statute?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,703.133,705.311,Not when if the defendant consented.
1981.80-1082,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,904.344,916.858,"Mr. Pitler, do you think there was role for a rule of implied bias under some circumstances?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,916.858,920.209,"Perhaps, yes, but not in the circumstances of this case."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,981.731,988.74,But didn't the juror -- I think the (Inaudible) didn't he mention it to the prosecutor?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,988.74,989.372,"No, Your Honor."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,989.372,992.189,But how the prosecutor find out about this?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,992.189,999.076,The way the prosecutor found out is that the -- the letter eventually got to the person in charge of hiring.
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,999.076,1000.364,Yes.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1000.364,1007.929,And -- and a -- a friend of the juror mentioned to an Assistant District Attorney that this person was on the jury.
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1010.08,1011.237,But his friend did?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1011.237,1015.05,"His friend did, there's a finding both in the state court --"
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1015.05,1016.698,He was kind of involved wasn't it?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1016.698,1019.523,"The juror -- no sir, the friend took in interest, but the juror --"
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1019.523,1022.42,Didn't you just say he told a friend?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1024.182,1027.8,"No, absolutely not, this is a friend by the name of Fontaine, it's the gentleman that --"
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1027.8,1031.737,I don't care a word about the name.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1044.582,1044.734,No --
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.734,1046.01,-- while the trial is going on.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1046.01,1048.001,"Your Honor, there is nothing in the record."
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.485,1060.433,"Mr. Pitler, right on that point, who mailed the letter into the office?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1060.433,1061.719,Mr. Fontaine.
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.719,1063.006,How do you explain that?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1063.006,1071.447,"What happened -- what happened was that the juror brought the letter to a luncheon meeting, and said, “Here it is, submit mine when you submit yours.”"
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.697,1075.101,"Rather unusual way to apply for a job, isn't it?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1075.101,1078.712,"No, I -- I don't think so.If you -- I mean, just give him the letter --"
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.712,1081.919,He had a man working for the prosecutor and mail the letter to the prosecutor.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1081.919,1083.329,"No -- no, Your Honor."
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1083.329,1083.958,Didn't Fontaine work in the --
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1083.958,1084.912,"No, he did not."
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.912,1085.903,He worked in the District Attorney's office?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1085.903,1086.644,"No, he did not."
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.772,1091.771,"Oh, I misunderstood."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1091.771,1092.957,He do not work to the prosecutor --
1981.80-1082,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1092.957,1094.929,And was he applying for a job too --
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1094.929,1094.958,He was.
1981.80-1082,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1094.958,1095.874,-- in the same office?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1095.874,1096.65,Yes.
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.09,1112.211,But he worked for the State?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1112.211,1114.302,He worked -- he worked as a court officer for the State.
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.302,1121.171,And did he have -- did Fontaine have further conversation with people under the prosecutor's office?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1121.171,1129.973,"Yes, he had at least one with Assistant District Attorney where he said, “Listen, you know my friend applied for a -- a job, he is a juror."
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.093,1147.741,And who told the trial -- trial prosecutor?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1147.741,1151.988,"The -- the Assistant District Attorney in charged of hiring for that position, Ms. Sudolnik."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1151.988,1161.962,"And that stage, the juror thought that possibly it might be a problem?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1161.962,1162.359,No.
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1162.359,1165.146,"Well, I misunderstood you."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1168.418,1169.408,"No, he didn't ask him to mention it."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1171.896,1174.89,And didn't he say you could find out if there was any problem?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1174.89,1180.552,"No, there was nothing -- no -- nothing discussion on any problem or anything."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1207.914,1213.725,"Well, why didn't the prosecutor at that stage said there was no problem mentioned?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1213.725,1222.096,"Prosecutor -- the prosecutor was wrong not to do that, we don't take issue with that, and that is not the -- yes sir."
1981.80-1082,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1222.096,1227.456,"This is irrelevant, but your statute is not the most artfully drawn isn't it?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1227.456,1229.175,"No, that statute was subsequent."
1981.80-1082,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1239.785,1242.45,I'm just looking at the last sentence.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1256.693,1263.263,That statute has been subsequently amended to require that -- that a mistrial be declared Justice Blackmun.
1981.80-1082,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1263.263,1264.823,It's a good thing that case is --
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1264.823,1269.017,It -- certainly is.
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.446,1419.302,"Mr. Pitler, under that rule in New York, suppose you have a juror who had been the victim of armed robbery and then he was called as juror on an armed robbery case."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1429.858,1431.947,He -- he deliberately failed to disclose?
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1431.947,1433.776,"He just didn't disclose it, that's right."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1433.776,1435.139,And there was no question asked?
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.139,1437.028,No questions asked.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1437.028,1438.405,And when is the discovery made?
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.405,1443.358,After the trial.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1443.358,1443.84,I think under the New York --
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.84,1444.951,It's a conviction.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1444.951,1448.128,"-- under the New York statute, you would have to have a showing of actual bias."
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.128,1449.082,You still would or would not?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1449.082,1450.552,You would.
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.305,1466.622,Do you think the -- do you think the Court of Appeals would have come out the same way if the prosecutor never known about this until after the trial?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1473.212,1477.811,"No, I don't think the Court of Appeals would have come -- I doubt very much the Court of Appeals would have come out this way."
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.811,1479.977,"Well, why not?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1479.977,1480.531,Because I think they focus --
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.531,1482.263,The possibility of bias was --
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1482.263,1487.188,I think they focused entirely on the prosecutor's misconduct and that's what they were concern.
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1487.188,1489.797,Didn't they make that pretty plain in the closing pages of their opinion.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1489.797,1492.971,"Yes, (Voice Overlap) I mean that's -- that's exactly what they did."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.338,1515.429,"But in terms of the possibility of bias, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference whether the prosecutor knew about it or not."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1515.429,1518.531,That's -- that's exactly our point Justice White.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.727,1568.879,"Would you think that the Second Circuit would come out the same way if the prosecutors had found out about it or told the judge about it, the judge that held the hearing at that very moment and come out just as he did in the hearing here, and then refused to remove the juror."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1574.096,1576.649,I -- I do not think they would have.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.699,1585.583,So you would --
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1585.583,1590.534,"You keep talking about what the Second Circuit might do, why don't you ask me something?"
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.426,1597.251,Oh well I -- can it be true about the Second Circuit.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1597.251,1605.982,"Well -- sometimes -- sometimes you can take a look at past opinions and precedents and predict what a court is going to do, not all the time."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1605.982,1607.066,Maybe I've been wrong?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1607.066,1608.109,Yes sir.
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1608.109,1610.355,Okay.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1610.355,1615.912,"Although I would -- I would say with all due respect, I am right more often than I'm wrong although sometimes it's a closed question."
1981.80-1082,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1615.912,1617.659,That's your opinion.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1617.659,1618.243,But -- but I --
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.243,1621.229,"Let me just ask one question, I'm not quite sure what your view was."
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1630.614,1634.547,"He -- he said in his opinion, I -- I don't want to speak for the trial judge."
1981.80-1082,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.152,1644.371,"All right, but you don't know whether he would have construed New York law, nevertheless to authorize --"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1644.371,1652.613,"No -- no I think the reality would have been, he would have said to the prosecutor, “Don't you think you should consent to the removal of the juror?”"
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.637,1659.932,It's pretty important --
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1659.932,1660.654,-- that situation.
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1660.654,1662.274,-- what the defense counsel is (Inaudible)
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1662.274,1665.368,"Yes, he would have asked -- he would have asked both in -- in that situation."
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1665.368,1675.611,"If -- if -- are you suggesting that if both counsel did not consent, he would not have -- on the basis of his statements, he would not have disqualified the juror?"
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1675.611,1677.365,I -- I think that that's a fair reading of his --
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1677.365,1679.678,It's a fair reading his own sentence.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1679.678,1681.168,Of his own view.
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.774,1702.533,It doesn't matter.
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1708.277,1711.906,"No, I read it that way, but analytically, I think that that is important."
1981.80-1082,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.787,1752.028,What's the rule -- what's -- what's the ruling of the cases in this Court with respect to the -- to the possible bias of the juror?
1981.80-1082,0,40183,robert_m_pitler,,1752.028,1762.269,"With respect to a possible bias of a juror, the United States versus Wood I think is the leading case, and that's the case I referred to in my discussion with Justice O'Connor."
1981.80-1082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1803.009,1809.015,"Well, Mr. Kunstler."
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1809.015,1811.982,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1981.80-1082,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.929,1898.482,"Mr. Kunstler, do you -- do you agree that the reasoning of the Court of Appeals was somewhat different than the reasoning of Judge Pierce?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1898.482,1902.085,"Justice Rehnquist, I do, but differently than Mr. Pitler does."
1981.80-1082,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.391,1958.465,But those -- those are the State statutes.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1961.222,1962.36,I understand that.
1981.80-1082,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.882,1987.963,Even if without the statute there would be no due process violation.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1987.963,1989.545,"Well, to a degree."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.327,2062.148,"Did the -- did the -- did the prosecutor who was trying the case and learned about this, testified?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2062.148,2062.474,Yes.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.952,2069.147,What was it -- what where they -- what was their explanation to the --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2069.147,2069.764,The rationale Justice White --
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.764,2071.099,-- for not telling the -- for not telling the judge --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2071.099,2074.168,I was in the middle of cross-examination of the defendant.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.168,2074.774,Right.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2074.774,2079.687,"I was preparing summation and therefore, I just couldn't get around to it."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.79,2091.286,"I wonder what -- if -- if -- if they testified, why they didn't reveal what they learned with the judge in the middle of the trial?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2091.286,2101.425,"Well, I think that's the reason that he gave, that he's mind was so filled with summation and so filled with cross-examination of the defendant who was I believe understand that at the time."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.425,2104.351,Well he just -- he just admitted to do it.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2104.351,2107.602,"He admitted to do it, but it's very strange Justice White that he did --"
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.602,2111.3,"He had no -- he -- he disaffirmed, he disavowed any tactical --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2111.3,2112.381,He did.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.685,2119.558,"The judge -- you know, the judge seemed to have -- I believe --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2119.558,2128.843,"He may have but a very interesting thing is that another juror, he did bring to the attention of the judge."
1981.80-1082,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2162.404,2164.365,"And what happened, Mr. Kunstler?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2164.365,2166.981,"That judge was excused, consent of all party."
1981.80-1082,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2342.414,2344.086,"Well, now you say they decided?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2344.086,2344.64,They decided.
1981.80-1082,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2344.64,2345.381,They get together --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2345.381,2357.971,"They got together, they testified at trial that they had met on it, but they had discussed it, and they decided to do nothing more but tell assistants, Lang, Holmes, Sudolnik not to consider it until after the trial."
1981.80-1082,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2357.971,2361.043,"Well, was there a decision, an affirmative decision not to tell the judge?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2361.043,2364.811,There was an affirmative decision not to tell the judge or defense counsel.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.703,2371.074,"Well, who is -- who do you -- you distinguished during the prosecutors and the --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2371.074,2374.353,"I'm using the trial prosecutors, a man named Litman and his assistance"
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.353,2375.449,You mean who's trying the case?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2375.449,2377.159,Who was trying the case.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.159,2386.739,And -- and the -- the assistant -- the assistant District Attorneys weren't trying the case --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2386.739,2390.542,"No, the assistants who are running the recruitment program were not trying the case."
1981.80-1082,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2390.542,2395.223,"Well, how many were together at this meeting at which they've decided not to tell the judge or the --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2395.223,2396.361,The two of them.
1981.80-1082,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2396.361,2397.584,Just the two trial prosecutors.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2397.584,2399.942,"LaPenta and Litman, the two trial prosecutors."
1981.80-1082,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2399.942,2401.375,Trial prosecutors.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2405.106,2409.238,"No, except Justice Brennan, after they have reached their decision."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.171,2426.336,"Well, is it -- is it those two prosecutors who met and decided not to deal with --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2426.336,2427.492,That's correct.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.622,2430.743,I believe the two that you -- that were -- and they testified.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2430.743,2431.589,They testified.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.589,2434.572,And they're the two who said their minds were so full of --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2434.572,2437.509,"Well that was the explanation given by Mr. Litman, I can't remember --"
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.509,2438.505,Who is Mr. Litman?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2438.568,2440.36,He was in chief trial prosecutor.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.36,2440.98,Yes.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2440.98,2443.663,He was the Assistant Attorney -- District Attorney in Georgia.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.663,2453.779,"Well, if the prosecutors actually met and made a deliberate decision about this, this isn't -- it wasn't in the middle of cross-examination is there --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2453.779,2457.14,"No, it was undoubtedly recess, evening."
1981.80-1082,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2607.398,2611.937,Any -- any effort to explain why Mr. Q was not told after the trial?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2611.937,2619.073,I did -- I can't remember the transcript that well Justice Brennan but he was not told until December 4th.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.207,2650.617,"Well, the record doesn't indicate that they made any knowing decision not to tell their superiors are not --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2650.617,2650.815,Justice White --
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.815,2653.805,"Or is it -- but certainly it was a failure to, there's no doubt about that."
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2653.805,2680.176,"I think, as I remember the testimony before the Judge Birns in the hearing, the decision was made not to tell the Court or defense counsel on the 14th of November and then the instructions were given to the Assistant District Attorneys who were working on the applications to just not do anything with the application or talk to the juror, communicate with them until after the trial."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.795,2683.299,Yes.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2683.299,2684.437,I don't remember that at all.
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2684.437,2687.364,And when did the trial judge find about that?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2687.364,2688.864,He found in December 9th.
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2688.864,2690.846,"Well, what did he find about the consequence of (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2690.846,2692.214,"Oh, the consequences?"
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.198,2694.369,-- to be bias?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2694.369,2697.98,Chief Justice Burger where he found no actual bias.
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2713.411,2719.964,Does the finding of no actual bias make it unnecessary to reach the next question you're suggesting?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2719.964,2723.392,"No, I think you must go to the next question because actual bias --"
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.392,2727.824,You mean per se -- you mean a per se bias from the circumstances?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2727.824,2728.59,That's correct.
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2729.264,2729.833,Well that's a little more (Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2729.833,2730.727,-- don't go to the next step --
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2730.727,2733.82,That's a little more than an implied bias isn't it?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2733.82,2735.365,"Well, implied bias is --"
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2735.365,2739.792,You don't need any implication if there's a per se rule.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2739.792,2745.952,"Well, when you say per se rule, I'm not sure I quite understand what you mean except as I understand what you're saying --"
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2745.952,2751.206,Do you mean -- do you usually mean it and every other context where the phrase is used?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2751.206,2754.113,"Well, I don't see a per se rule here."
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2809.015,2814.319,Wouldn't that problem take care of itself in the majority selection process?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2814.319,2815.132,Would it take care of itself?
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2815.132,2816.202,Would it take care of itself?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2816.202,2816.662,No.
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2816.662,2819.241,"Wouldn't it be just -- you mean, if he disclosed --"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2819.241,2819.528,"Oh, no."
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2819.528,2820.317,Will they work?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2820.317,2826.884,"If he disclosed it during the voir dire, then you have chance to take care of it, of course, I agree with that."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.562,2880.631,"Mr. Kunster, how would a -- what are the possibilities of biasing the jury if he files this application for a job?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2885.806,2888.848,"Well, you never can tell actually, of course, because the only --"
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.848,2890.311,"Well, what are the possibilities?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2890.311,2902.033,"The possibilities are that this man who was totally unqualified, if you -- in the record you'll find that his application was later rejected because he was unqualified."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.033,2904.716,And (Inaudible) to convict in order to get a job is that it?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2904.716,2908.7,"Well, to be more inclined to convict, then not."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.992,2934.736,"And if he -- and if he innocently file that as a claim is, it -- it maybe -- he might -- he might have been -- he certainly would have thought or the argument is that he would have been less -- he would have thought it would hurt his chances to get the job if he voted to quit, is that it?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2934.736,2957.02,"I think a reasonable man might find that conclusion, I think as Justice Marshall said, the first Mr. Justice Marshall said in the Burr case, there are some situations where we must comply biased, and one of those is where a man is a job seeker with the prosecutor."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.445,2973.729,"Well, if you're right about that, then if it did come up on voir dire, it wouldn't have been amazing, you would have said that you -- you had a challenge for cause."
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2973.729,2973.942,Yeah.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.026,2978.889,And don't you have to take that position at this -- at?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2978.889,2981.336,"Yes, I think it would be a cause for challenge."
1981.80-1082,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2998.762,3004.513,"Well, if you were trying the case, (Inaudible) the juror, I bet you'd use a peremptory right quick."
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3004.513,3005.045,I used peremptory –-
1981.80-1082,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3005.045,3006.493,And you lost out in the cause --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3006.493,3007.888,I tried cause first –-
1981.80-1082,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3007.888,3008.393,Yes.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3008.393,3010.192,"When I came at proper on that, I would go to the peremptory."
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3010.192,3021.329,"How do you square that -- how do you square that with what this Court said in Witherspoon that you can be against, you can have contentious objections against the capital punishment but you can still sit on the jury."
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3021.329,3023.173,"Well, I think that's true."
1981.80-1082,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3065.994,3072.472,What are the proceedings in New York for finding out after the fact how a particular juror voted?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3078.498,3079.37,Not at all.
1981.80-1082,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3095.329,3104.817,Doesn't that militate against then finding implied bias for a juror who has a job application in?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3104.817,3105.06,No.
1981.80-1082,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3105.078,3111.353,"Might not that person feel that nobody would know or be entitled to know, so it wouldn't matter."
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3111.353,3115.042,"Well, because the juror has the option of being quiet."
1981.80-1082,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3115.042,3115.334,Right.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3115.334,3117.283,"If I find out, you'll rarely find out anything."
1981.80-1082,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3140.691,3146.694,I just wonder whether that fact doesn't militate against finding implied bias.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3146.694,3147.723,I don't think so.
1981.80-1082,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3172.638,3179.684,"You don't allege that the post-trial hearing which was held was anything but fair, do you?"
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3179.684,3180.121,No.
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3244.718,3251.092,Could you disclose the -- these future plans about these ambitions for law enforcements?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3251.092,3251.918,On the voir dire?
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3251.918,3252.329,Yes.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3252.329,3252.809,Yes.
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3357.349,3358.701,That's all speculation --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3358.701,3359.976,"No, they admit that in their brief."
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3359.976,3361.341,-- in your part.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3361.341,3368.827,"I thought it was all a speculation from the newspaper reports, but then I noticed in their brief, they say the same thing."
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3377.444,3382.305,"I'm speaking of your psychoanalysis, or dismantled process."
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3382.305,3387.682,"It has to be speculation, but I think it's a speculation when you do -- go into implied bias, you have to do it."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.856,3607.605,How many -- how many judges refused to set this aside?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3607.605,3608.372,I didn't hear that.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3608.372,3614.035,How many -- how many judges refused to set this aside after this post-trial hearing?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3614.035,3618.334,"Well, interestingly enough, the Appellate Division affirmed without opinion."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3618.334,3622.056,But there was a -- a fellow -- the judge who held the hearing.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3622.056,3623.628,Judge Birns was one.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.477,3628.436,So he would be one out of your 1000?
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3628.436,3635.355,"Well, I'm not so sure that he didn't say, yes, he would be one out of my 10,000."
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3638.038,3641.185,"No, no."
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3644.16,3645.406,We had five there.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3645.406,3646.472,And they -- they --
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3646.472,3647.201,They did too.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3649.334,3649.382,That's right.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3649.382,3659.662,"-- because they are seeking to -- and -- and to avoid the enormous expense in setting aside of a jury verdict which is very hard, the ordinary person that's on the appearance of justice --"
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3659.662,3660.294,Right.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3660.294,3664.526,-- is not a judge and isn't sitting on this kind of a situation.
1981.80-1082,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3666.218,3666.648,All right.
1981.80-1082,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3667.16,3669.163,Thank you.
1981.80-1082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3670.072,3671.954,Do you have anything further Mr. Pitler?
1981.80-1082,2,40183,robert_m_pitler,,3676.755,3682.334,Listening to Mr. Kunstler described the case it has nothing to do with the relationship or reality or the record.
1981.80-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3723.837,3724.686,What about the other juror?
1981.80-1082,2,40183,robert_m_pitler,,3726.466,3733.191,"Because that was -- what happened was that -- it's been going on for a while, they were getting on the voir dire minutes and they knew about that for a while and they finally disclose that."
1981.80-1082,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3733.191,3739.249,But don't you think the possibility of talking to the judge occurred to them when they met outside then?
1981.80-1082,2,40183,robert_m_pitler,,3739.249,3741.382,"Judge, I -- I really do not think so."
1981.80-1082,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3796.646,3797.363,Thank you gentlemen.
