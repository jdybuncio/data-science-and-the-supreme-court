1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.837,We will hear arguments next in Fleck against Spannaus.
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,42.628,46.941,Mr Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,79.177,81.29,What is the name of the case again?
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,81.29,84.554,Raybestos Manhattan.
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,84.554,93.902,"And we should change that to, what is the correction again?"
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,93.902,97.07,It appears in your brief as 156 Atlantic Second.
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,100.271,105.361,"Well, in mine, it appears as 365."
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,109.074,112.501,"I still have not got it right, now I have I hope."
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,112.501,115.804,"Well, between us, we will get it straightened out."
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,118.464,130.547,The Court may recall that this is sort of a companion case to the White Motor case you decided recently involving the Minnesota Pension Protection Act.
1977.77-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.058,144.872,"You said patent regulation, you mean pension?"
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,144.872,147.502,Pension.
1977.77-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.006,431.544,"Mr. Christensen, I suppose in the strictly technical sense, there is not an impairment of contract in so far as Allied is concerned here in the sense that a contractual expectation that it had was taken away from it."
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,450.032,485.377,"Well, I think the term has been expanded over the years by the Courts, but there is a very definite impairment Mr. Justice Rehnquist in the sense I believe you were talking about because Allied had a right to terminate this pension plan with no penalty and Minnesota said in effect, you cannot terminate this plan even though the contract gives you an unlimited right so to do."
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,493.176,496.952,"Well, it had imposed the new obligations, is that your argument?"
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,496.952,499.919,"Well, you can call it a new obligation."
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.609,549.503,"You think the state could if a company had no bargained for plan or no voluntary plan, you think a state statute could require the company to adopt a statutory type plan?"
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,558.405,567.476,"Well, that Your Honor, I do not think would involve the obligation of contracts clause."
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.511,577.266,Is that very far away from what the Social Security Act as Mr. Justice White’s suggestion?
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,577.266,598.527,"Well, it is not too far away from it, but Your Honor, your point now is addressed to the powers of the Federal Government and it is not directed to destroying or altering or changing a private contract."
1977.77-747,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,598.527,604.539,What you are suggesting is that the Federal Government is not bound by the retirement clause the way the states are?
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,604.539,608.283,That is correct and that there is no doubt about that Your Honor.
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.283,622.19,"Are you also suggesting that a state could not have adopted what is essentially the social security statute, independent of federal action?"
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,622.19,626.621,I do not know if I am prepared to answer that question.
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.78,686.265,"Mr. Christensen, in your argument, it would make a difference whether it was for the future of the payouts, would it not?"
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,686.265,700.337,"Yes certainly, but you are now talking about a thing unconnected with service just at a certain age or they put in a tax."
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.96,761.193,"Mr. Christensen, are there not really two parts to the retroactive aspect of this case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question brought this to mind."
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,779.577,780.114,No.
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.042,814.756,But if you terminate the plan --
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,814.756,815.669,No sir --
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.669,823.032,"That you are asserting that in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you pointed out that the contractual right to terminate the plan had been impaired."
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,823.032,825.636,That is correct.
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.636,829.956,But how did that hurt you then if all the money was in there to stay anyway?
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,829.956,834.142,Because Minnesota has imposed this pension funding charge --
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.142,838.089,I understand the requirement that you put more money into the pot that hurts you?
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,838.089,838.706,Yes.
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.706,841.454,But that is not an impairment of an existing obligation.
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,844.111,849.436,"Well, or it is a condition."
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.436,861.773,"And your answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist was that, well, they have impaired our right to cancel the plan, now how did that hurt you, the no longer being able to cancel the plan?"
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,863.476,866.541,I do not think a conditional right to cancel it.
1977.77-747,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.169,905.198,You mean what you want is the right to terminate without paying additional money?
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,905.198,906.404,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.404,918.683,Did the state prevent you from terminating the plan with respect to any newly hired employees?
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,918.683,921.171,No.
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.03,946.907,What about the employees transferred to another plan?
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,953.39,955.491,I will have to go off the record.
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.18,957.822,"Well, that is alright."
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,961.345,962.607,They had such a thing here.
1977.77-747,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.714,975.177,"You go ahead, I am sorry to interrupt."
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,975.177,982.591,But it is clear that this Act requires the employer to pay some money for an earlier period.
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,983.919,987.916,"Yes sir, it is very retroactive."
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,987.916,995.22,"So that it is not just altering an existing contract with respect to the future, you say?"
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,1002.894,1003.657,Yes.
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1111.474,1112.099,12 o' clock.
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,1112.099,1116.849,"12 o' clock, I would prefer to reserve the balance of my time if I may?"
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1116.849,1120.673,Very well.
1977.77-747,0,25141,george_b_christensen,,1120.673,1129.873,I will answer any questions right now if there are any more at the moment.
1977.77-747,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1129.873,1133.164,Mr. Starns.
1977.77-747,1,18066,byron_e_starns,,1133.164,1135.409,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-747,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1151.093,1156.153,"Well, is the plan being terminated because the plant is closing?"
1977.77-747,1,18066,byron_e_starns,,1156.153,1159.506,"No Your Honor, the plan is still in effect as of this date."
1977.77-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.082,1256.891,"Mr. Starns, are you saying there has been no impairment?"
1977.77-747,1,18066,byron_e_starns,,1256.891,1259.758,I think that is the sense of our argument.
1977.77-747,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1259.758,1266.548,"I have read that the District Court’s opinion that say you in effect conceded there was impairment, but that was justifiable?"
1977.77-747,1,18066,byron_e_starns,,1266.548,1268.395,"Your Honor, I think I could clarify that point."
1977.77-747,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1284.774,1304.136,We will resume there at 1:00[Recess]
1977.77-747,1,18066,byron_e_starns,,1306.656,1309.107,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-747,2,25141,george_b_christensen,,2634.299,2639.901,Briefly if I may your Honor?
