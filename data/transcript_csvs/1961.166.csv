1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,22.096,25.714,May it please the Court.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,219.882,225.456,Were any of the members the -- were -- of the -- of the union employees of that company?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,225.456,226.084,No.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,226.084,226.873,They were not.
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,226.873,238.917,"The union had no members at the Colorado -- at the Carnegie, I'm sorry, I should have said Carnegie Coal and Fuel Company nor did the union have any members at the Interlake Iron Company."
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,244.038,247.527,Were all of the -- all of the employees in this --
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,247.527,247.816,Actually --
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,247.816,250.768,-- local supervisors?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,250.768,252.541,"That is the issue which I'd like to come to later, Your Honor."
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,252.541,253.737,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,256.695,272.104,"Before the lower court, a first a restraining order was issued and then after hearing, the restraining order was merged into a temporary injunction and finally into a permanent injunction."
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,570.958,573.33,Assuming this is a laborer.
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,573.33,579.271,Correct Your Honor and I will come to that in the course of my argument.
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,610.057,618.948,"Mr. Pressman, the symmetric near involvements on the conduct or rather on whether this is a laborer?"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,618.948,620.629,"Your Honor, I've had grave difficulty."
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,630.722,649.363,"Well, my point though is, in assuming a company sworn by the laborer, I can (Inaudible) in assuming you have (Inaudible) and this is the question of whether there's inter labor work."
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,649.363,650.001,That's correct Your Honor.
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,650.001,652.51,Could the same test apply?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,652.51,654.351,For reasonably or arguably you mean?
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,719.869,722.004,"Well, was there evidence taken Mr. Pressman (Voice Overlap)--"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,722.004,725.608,"Your Honor, the record shows the following."
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,737.238,740.274,Was their evidence to support this finding?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,740.274,746.583,"Yes, there's no question about that that the marine engineers of the petitioner are supervisors."
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,762.863,770.915,"Now, may -- may I be clear about this, which is to say, there was no testimony taken as to the composition of MEBA."
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,770.915,773.546,I will state now what we have in the record.
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1061.134,1066.844,Who -- is there anything as to -- about the employees of the secondary employer in this case?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1066.844,1085.112,"Your Honor, in the complaint, the respondents set forth that there were workers of Carnegie Coal and Fuel Company who were working on that ship until the picket line was established and that was -- the picket line was established they ceased working."
1961.166,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1187.748,1207.588,"If it were found that MEBA were -- had the Local Board, it was supposed exclusively the supervisors, was that the purview, suppose (Inaudible) nonetheless if labor organization, doesn't mean it was implicated?"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1207.588,1208.999,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1961.166,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1223.543,1230.681,(Inaudible)
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1230.681,1235.91,Your Honor that's the test that has been laid down by the National Labor Relations Board.
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1388.831,1396.96,"Mr. Pressman, has MEBA involved this issue in the courts of other states or as Minnesota do?"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1396.96,1400.417,"I think Minnesota, Your Honor, is the first state where we've had the issue up."
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1417.203,1418.714,Is the work jurisdictions?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1418.714,1419.273,Pardon me?
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1419.273,1420.594,Work jurisdiction?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1420.594,1425.227,"No, it was a secondary boycott, same issue, secondary boycott."
1961.166,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1473.143,1501.919,"The thing I â€“ suppose this, because I gather you see that it was local, suppose it's not the supervisors or its employees could not be a labor (Inaudible)of the findings of facts, a statement which said not contested to the membership of the local was (Inaudible)"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1501.919,1504.732,"No, Your Honor, you may -- I'm -- I'm sure you misunderstood me."
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1558.552,1571.43,"Mr. Pressman, is there -- is the relationship of engineers to the employers any different on the Great Lakes than it is in other parts of the country where these other -- other cases arose?"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1571.43,1572.196,None Your Honor.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1572.196,1572.865,There is none.
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1572.865,1573.387,None.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1573.387,1573.581,None at all.
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1573.581,1579.846,Situations will vary where on some vessels be it in the harbors and the rivers --
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1579.846,1580.343,Yes.
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1580.343,1586.978,-- where our marine engineers will not be supervising anybody and then eliminates them as -- from the status of being supervisors.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1586.978,1586.987,Yes.
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1586.987,1596.935,Marine engineers in other situations mostly in the offshore and on the Great Lakes are supervisors because customarily they have non-supervisors whom they're supervising.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1596.935,1597.055,"Yes, though --"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1597.055,1601.535,But we have among our membership as to Graham Transportation case indicates.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1605.62,1607.324,On -- on the -- on the Great Lakes?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1607.324,1608.475,This is on the harbor.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1608.475,1612.266,"Now, is there -- how about the membership in the -- on the Great Lakes?"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1612.266,1612.455,On the Great Lakes --
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1612.455,1613.05,(Voice Overlap) --
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1613.05,1619.973,"-- I would say that the marine engineers on the Great Lakes have primary the same status as those of the primary employer here, the respondent."
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1619.973,1626.688,"Yes, but my point is do you take into the union other than engineers on the Great Lakes?"
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1626.688,1629.128,"Your Honor, we take in none but marine engineers."
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1629.128,1629.883,Marine engineers?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1629.883,1632.525,But within the concept of marine engineers.
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1641.451,1642.507,And that's on the Great Lakes?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1642.507,1643.252,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1643.252,1643.731,Yes.
1961.166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1643.731,1646.233,How about Local 101 that you mentioned?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1646.233,1649.917,What I've just said applies to both the National MEBA and Local 101.
1961.166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.917,1655.472,"And you would agree, I suppose there are some fair and legal practices that you could not commit."
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1655.472,1657.054,That we can or cannot (Inaudible).
1961.166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.054,1660.407,You could not commit even though you are a labor organization?
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1660.407,1660.917,"No, Your Honor."
1961.166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.339,1672.547,Now the --
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1672.547,1672.675,Now --
1961.166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.675,1676.569,One of the -- some of them require you to be doing something with the employee.
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1676.569,1678.73,That -- that provision we would not violate.
1961.166,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1678.73,1679.23,That's right.
1961.166,0,34993,lee_pressman,,1681.158,1683.555,"The second -- I -- I think that was true, Your Honor."
1961.166,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1688.448,1692.673,"Thank you, sir."
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1694.344,1699.876,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1791.997,1793.995,Who filed the statement?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1793.995,1796.074,This is the trial court's memorandum.
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1796.074,1796.573,"Oh, I see."
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1796.573,1810.039,"And in their brief, they completely emasculate and misrepresent this statement admitting the fact, the first part."
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1819.294,1821.501,"Now, would you tell us where that -- just where that is."
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1821.501,1823.851,"Record 18, sir."
1961.166,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1865.422,1867.708,Are you talking about the printed record?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1868.249,1869.705,Are you talking about the printed record?
1961.166,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1871.991,1873.346,This is at page --
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1873.346,1873.626,At page --
1961.166,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1873.626,1874.301,-- 24?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1874.301,1877.435,"-- 24 I think, to 26."
1961.166,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1987.215,1987.278,Now the --
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1987.278,1987.704,(Inaudible)
1961.166,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1987.704,1988.827,"The findings, Mr. Jackson."
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1988.827,1989.553,Pardon?
1961.166,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1989.553,1994.268,"The findings, the final findings begin on page 29 of the record, do they?"
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,1994.268,1999.944,"I think the final findings begin on -- on page 29, sir."
1961.166,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2005.049,2008.017,And upon which of those findings do you rely?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2008.017,2010.216,"Well, I re -- I rely in all of them."
1961.166,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2010.216,2014.512,But there are several numbered findings and I thought perhaps you --
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2014.512,2014.788,"No, Your Honor, I -- I --"
1961.166,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2014.788,2016.035,Or (Voice Overlap) on one or more of them.
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2016.035,2018.707,I'm afraid I have only added to confusion.
1961.166,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2031.871,2032.171,I understand.
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2032.171,2040.503,But what findings do you point out this -- that's being conclusive against the defendants for the petitioners' position?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2040.503,2042.93,"Well, if Your Honor please."
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2056.184,2059.054,Is this -- just taking them by and large?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2059.054,2059.525,No.
1961.166,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2076.219,2093.129,"Now, do you disagree that the statement, the lower court did not find that all of the memberships, prior memberships of the Local (Inaudible)"
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2093.129,2093.629,Well --
1961.166,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2093.629,2094.387,(Inaudible)
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2094.387,2095.301,I --

1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2097.658,2104.078,"I reply -- rely on finding 2 of page 29 of the record, printed record in this Court."
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2120.885,2123.565,You read that to mean that they admit only --
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2123.565,2124.97,That's right.
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2124.97,2125.953,(Inaudible) engineers.
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2125.953,2130.447,And I -- I don't think there's any kind of worthy that that is true.
1961.166,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2146.97,2159.087,Is that the only -- only one of these findings that you point to as settling the question raised to the effect that all marine engineers are supervisors?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2159.087,2161.549,"Well, I'm not sure that's the only question raised, Your Honor."
1961.166,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2161.549,2165.709,Why -- that was -- that wasn't being discussed?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2165.709,2176.884,"Well, I -- I think the evidence, only evidence there is, is to the effect that the -- they take members of the license of marine engineers under Great Lakes."
1961.166,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2195.389,2197.647,Suppose you are wrong on that.
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2197.647,2198.261,Well --
1961.166,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2198.261,2198.279,Suppose --
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2198.279,2239.443,"Suppose I'm wrong, my printed proposition as I hoped to develop is that assuming that this Local 101 did have this counsel argued two or three non-supervisor members but otherwise, its membership was -- are composed of supervisors and that we have here an activity directed to trying to compel an employer to recognize that role call as the bargaining agent for its admittedly supervisor personnel that would still not deprive the state courts of jurisdiction."
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2838.099,2842.161,What were the deficiencies in the record that cause the court to -- to take the petition?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2842.161,2861.053,"Well, they relied in part upon an old admission and an old pleading and upon some very -- they have court's passing -- they felt there rather inferences drawn from not the very good development of the facts."
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2880.878,2883.449,Might we not have the same situation here?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2883.449,2886.321,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2886.321,2891.358,Because -- because of a failure to show what the membership consisted of?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,2891.358,2893.484,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1961.166,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3309.474,3312.854,"But Mr. -- Mr. Jackson, may I ask this."

1961.166,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3568.226,3570.017,Who would make that determination?
1961.166,1,39611,raymond_t_jackson,,3570.017,3578.35,"Well, I think if it is close enough, it might be that the Court couldn't but if its close -- if it isn't closed, certainly isn't here I don't get any question about."
