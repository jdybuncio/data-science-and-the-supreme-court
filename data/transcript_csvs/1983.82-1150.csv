1983.82-1150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.896,"We will hear arguments next in Howard Ellis against Brotherhood of Railway, Airline, and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees, et al.--"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,12.129,21.073,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, a familiar presence is in the Court today, the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks."
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,42.839,45.481,"Do the other unions just defer to you, or--"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,45.481,49.845,"--It is sometimes not pleasant to be special, Your Honor."
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.279,152.541,"--Mr. Merrill, are you saying that any time the individual says something that is done to him violates the First Amendment and the person who is violating the First Amendment or alleged to is interested primarily in the financial outcome, that that automatically decides the case?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,152.541,155.753,"Justice Rehnquist, I do not make that assertion."
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.234,493.529,Weren't there closed shops in the railway industry before the early fifties?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,493.529,494.628,"There were not, Your Honor."
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.898,509.828,So this Act didn't follow the same path as the National Labor Relations Act.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,509.828,527.981,"That is correct, and I might point out that the railway unions had never found compulsory unionism to be essential to their well-being because at the time of the 1934 statute, only one such organization had compulsory membership provisions in it."
1983.82-1150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.299,695.231,"That is really not the test they stated, is it, any conceivable, arguable relationship?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,695.231,708.741,"Their test is stated that it is anything that is done by the... the work of the union that is germane to the realm of collective bargaining, a test we have not seen in any other case before or since."
1983.82-1150,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.741,711.222,But it is quite a different test than the one you just stated.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,711.222,717.337,"In practice, Your Honor, I believe that it is exactly the test that I stated."
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.551,774.865,"Well, you don't think we've decided this issue before, do you?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,774.865,780.958,The issue before this Court has not been decided other than to the extent--
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.958,781.979,We have left it open.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,781.979,784.08,--Except to say--
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.08,785.532,These kinds of things.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,785.532,795.647,"--The antecedents of the decision are certainly present in Abood, Justice White, when it found that the use of dissenters' dues over their objection for ideological--"
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.647,800.261,"Well, we couldn't have left it open if it is so obvious that it is unconstitutional."
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,800.261,803.083,--I am prepared to agree.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.083,804.433,"Well, I know."
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,805.624,813.179,"Well, certainly the issues before the Court are presented on the appropriate record for the first time today."
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.623,860.239,"Mr. Merrill, are you going to address yourself to the so-called Paragraph 22 items one by one at some point during your oral argument?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,860.239,864.483,Time does not permit me to address them individually.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.997,874.189,What about the annual meeting?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,874.189,877.97,"That would be the quadrennial convention, Justice White?"
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.97,878.621,Yes.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,878.621,888.028,"I can address the convention, and I think my comments will apply to the other Paragraph 22 activities in question."
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.716,956.212,"Part of your response to Justice White suggests to me that you view our previous cases in the Railway Labor Act as saying that the union has to justify any charges it makes to your members, rather than saying that your members must make some sort of a showing to avoid paying what is otherwise the normal agency fee."
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,956.212,962.036,I believe that I agree with the gist of Justice Rehnquist's remarks.
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.401,986.303,What about social activities?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1002.012,1011.427,"Well, certainly the Court in Abood recognized that the First Amendment freedoms encompass union social activities."
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.44,1016.881,"In Abood, how did it recognize that?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1016.881,1040.268,"--It recognized that when it listed... when it rejected the union argument that only political and ideological activities of the union were safeguarded by the First Amendment, and the Court said, we have never held that the First Amendment does not also cover social, literary, artistic, philosophical, and religious activity."
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1040.268,1045.271,"Well, you think the Court in Abood meant that the First Amendment covers a dance in the union hall?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1045.271,1046.002,I certainly do.
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.071,1079.705,Just how would you go about connecting up the First Amendment with what you say are your clients' rights here?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1079.705,1097.907,"I would do that by saying, as the Court did in Street, when it placed a strained construction, according to one Justice, upon the statute, and it said only those duties under the Railway Labor Act can be the subject of charges."
1983.82-1150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1102.369,1103.391,Okay.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1136.781,1148.38,--I believe that the antecedents of that proposition are present in Abood when it said that there must be a governmental necessity for the extraction of the fees.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.38,1152.701,That isn't necessarily a constitutional argument.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1161.537,1162.719,That is true.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.719,1177.609,"You could say that in order to justify any fee, you must show... somebody must show that Congress anticipated that the non-union employees could be charged this much to cover these things."
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1177.609,1178.819,That is correct.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.819,1180.942,And it wouldn't have to be anything to do with the Constitution.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1180.942,1196.23,"We can win the case, but we cannot obtain the appropriate remedy, because the use of these dissenters' fees has been expended on activities of the union which violate their First Amendment rights, so the remedy cannot--"
1983.82-1150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.23,1201.913,Does it violate their rights in the sense that they pay for it but they are not permitted to take part?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1203.456,1204.905,--It is not.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.205,1224.4,What if the statute didn't contemplate your clients being charged for these kinds of things?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1235.426,1241.52,Because the use by the union inflicts more than a monetary injury.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.237,1252.817,"Well, what kind of a remedy do you want?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1252.817,1253.999,--We want--
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1253.999,1255.799,"Do you want somebody to be whipped, or what?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1256.63,1264.084,--Given the history of intransigence of this union and its approach to the plaintiff's clients--
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.084,1265.026,What do you want?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1266.217,1267.247,--We would like--
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.247,1270.108,Let's assume you get your money back because of a statutory violation.
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1271.259,1277.684,--We would like to have the Ninth Circuit's delineation of chargeable activities set aside--
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.684,1280.215,"Well, you could do that under the statute if you are--"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1280.215,1281.317,--That is correct.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.317,1282.198,--Then what?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1282.198,1301.679,"The case is to be remanded to the trial court, and in the trial court BRAC should be required to prove for the first time its costs of collective bargaining with Western Airlines, and to prove those costs by clear and convincing evidence."
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.679,1310.796,"So what you want as some remedy for the future, some clear, sharp remedy for the future."
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1310.796,1312.596,We can only have a remedy for the future.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.754,1326.237,"Well, I don't know why you couldn't get all that under the statute, if you are right in your construction of the statute."
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1326.237,1339.246,"Well, in addition, we would request that this Court instruct the District Court to enter a judgment declaring that the union's rebate procedure is constitutionally inadequate."
1983.82-1150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1339.246,1352.162,"Mr. Merrill, since the respondent union was decertified in 1980, why is the issue concerning the rebate plan not moot?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1352.162,1353.913,The issue is assuredly not moot.
1983.82-1150,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1398.084,1400.545,"Well, don't you have a statute of limitations problem?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1403.207,1407.729,I believe that there is no statute of limitations problem at this time.
1983.82-1150,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1407.729,1409.411,"Well, you said you wanted a rebate."
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1412.013,1418.267,The damages claim was brought virtually contemporaneously with the extraction of the funds.
1983.82-1150,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1418.267,1419.928,Back into 1970?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1419.928,1424.909,"It was brought... the cases were first filed in March, 1973."
1983.82-1150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1424.909,1426.882,"Well, it would be all right then."
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1435.889,1449.119,"In the motion for summary judgment which led to the Paragraph 22 ruling, we pointed out that not all publication expenses were per se deemed to be non-chargeable."
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.459,1484.272,"Mr. Merrill, was the union decertified entirely?"
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1484.272,1485.413,It was.
1983.82-1150,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.413,1493.448,It is now not the collective bargaining agency for any Western employees?
1983.82-1150,0,36336,michael_e_merrill,,1493.448,1496.23,I believe that to be true.
1983.82-1150,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1527.659,1529.211,Very well.
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1532.974,1566.064,"May it please the Court, I think it would be helpful in light of the discussion to this point to state our understanding of the holdings of this Court on this issue to this point and our understanding of the issues that those holdings leave open."
1983.82-1150,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.577,2108.3,You haven't mentioned the social particularly.
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2108.3,2123.05,"No, Your Honor, because the union defends its right to charge for social activity as that term is used here."
1983.82-1150,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2148.354,2157.221,"What about chartering a steamer on the Mississippi for $5,000 the week before the union elections?"
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2159.742,2163.946,"--If it were chartered by one candidate or the other, it would be--"
1983.82-1150,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2163.946,2166.237,"No, the union, the union is paying the bill."
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2166.237,2228.016,"--It would be... and the union paid the bill, it would be a violation of the Landrum-Griffin Act, but putting that aside, we believe first of all, and I will turn to this... I will turn to this by way of responding to your question, we believe first of all that the statute contemplates at least normal union expenditures for such social expenditures, and that as Justice Rehnquist said, we cannot understand an argument based on the Constitution insofar as limits on the statute are concerned."
1983.82-1150,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2228.016,2237.053,"Mr. Gold, my recollection is that Abood expressly left open the question as to social activities of the union."
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2237.053,2238.815,"It did indeed, Your Honor."
1983.82-1150,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2288.047,2296.242,"I suppose they are de minimis, but if you did have that boat chartered to go down the river, would non-union members be invited to go also?"
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2296.242,2308.29,The union's position in this case is that objecting employees cannot be charged for activities that are closed to them.
1983.82-1150,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2308.29,2309.902,So they could go if they wished to?
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2309.902,2310.523,Yes.
1983.82-1150,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2310.523,2311.542,They may not be welcome.
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2311.542,2313.252,"No, they are welcome."
1983.82-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.923,2317.015,What about the quadrennial meeting?
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2317.015,2337.488,"The quadrennial meeting, Justice White, was one of the expenses that the proponents of the union security provision said expressly would be covered by the union's security provision."
1983.82-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.001,2346.324,"That is one of the activities, though, that is not open to--"
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2346.324,2351.309,"--Well, it is not open to anyone who isn't elected."
1983.82-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.941,2422.313,"--Well, non-members can't vote at this point."
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2422.313,2424.316,"No, but they can be members."
1983.82-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.405,2430.931,"They can be members, but if they aren't members, they nevertheless can be charged--"
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2430.931,2431.77,--That's--
1983.82-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.77,2433.612,--even though they can't take part in it.
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2433.612,2439.396,--Even though they have made the choice not to--
1983.82-1150,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.396,2442.047,So it is different from the river boat.
1983.82-1150,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2448.102,2449.164,--That's correct.
1983.82-1150,2,36336,michael_e_merrill,,3606.897,3628.613,"May it please the Court, I would point out with great emphasis that Congress was not importuned by the unions because... to grant a privilege to obtain moneys from dissenting employees because of its fraternal activities."
1983.82-1150,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3724.827,3726.777,"Mr. Merrill, let me just be sure I understand."
1983.82-1150,2,36336,michael_e_merrill,,3732.469,3733.801,--Not presently.
1983.82-1150,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3766.722,3768.364,But you are not now challenging it?
1983.82-1150,2,36336,michael_e_merrill,,3771.837,3775.199,"--Well, it truly wasn't important, because we contend that--"
1983.82-1150,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3775.199,3790.858,"I mean, it seems to me it is a very great difference between an issue as to whether death benefits can be charged when they are administered in a non-discriminatory neutral fashion, and all you have to do is be an employee on the one hand, whereas one that said you have to be a union member would raise quite a different question."
1983.82-1150,2,36336,michael_e_merrill,,3790.858,3794.541,--It is our primary position that the death benefits program is not chargeable.
