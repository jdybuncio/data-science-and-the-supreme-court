2015.14-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.675,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-1146, Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo. Mr. Phillips."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,8.675,45.76,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has made clear that class actions are only appropriate when the plaintiff's proof is tailored to their specific theory of liability in a way that allows class-wide injury to be determined in one stroke, and that the lower courts must engage in a rigorous analysis in order to demonstrate that fact. In this Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue a class of more than 3300 employees who occupied job -- more than 400 jobs which required widely differing amounts of time to perform their donning, doffing, and washing tasks."
2015.14-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,45.76,60.75,"Well, is that so? Because as far as I understand this, there was some donning and doffing that was common, that is, there was some sanitation and some protective gear that they all had to wear."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,76.95,94.91,"Well, there -- there are a number of answers to that, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, if you -- if you just look at the activities that Dr. Mericle specifically testified about, for certain activities, he found some employees who take 30 seconds to get dressed and others who took more than 10 minutes to get dressed --"
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,94.91,95.31,"Well, but you didn't --"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,95.31,97.07,-- in certain circumstances in --
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.07,111.865,"-- the statistical mechanism of your own, you didn't have a Daubert objection to the testimony, and you suggest in your brief that uninjured plaintiffs are included in aggregate damages, but you were the one that objected to the bifurcated trial."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,122.08,131.99,"There are a number of questions embedded in there, Justice Kennedy. The -- the first one is -- and we objected all along to having this class certified on the basis that there were a wide range of --"
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.99,140.445,"Yeah, but once you lose that, you have also other defenses: Your own expert, a Daubert objection, et cetera."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,140.445,143.81,"But Justice Kennedy, we don't have to bring forward an expert."
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,185.32,191.29,"Mr. Phillips, I'm completely at a loss as to what you're complaining about."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,243.015,245.33,"Justice Sotomayor, I would -- I would -- yes."
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.96,254.12,"Oh, no, no."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,272.9,275.72,We -- we don't have any quarrel with Mt. Clemens the way it was written.
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,287.46,289.115,There were time records to that effect here.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,289.115,289.32,Right.
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,291.85,291.94,No.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,298.885,327.58,"And -- and the jury rejected Dr. Mericle's averaging of -- of 18 -- 18 and 20 -- 18 and a half and 21 minutes, and we don't know what the impact of that is. What we do know is that Fox calculated that a mere three minutes' departure from Mericle's numbers dropped the damages award by $1.41 million, and dropped the number of plaintiffs out by close to 125. So Justice Kennedy, the small differences make a big difference in -- in this particular case."
2015.14-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.58,338.225,"Can we go back to Justice Sotomayor's basic question, that is, when the government sued Tyson or Tyson's predecessor and got an injunction --"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,338.225,338.895,Right.
2015.14-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,338.895,355.59,"-- what Tyson's did, it had its own industrial engineer observe the workers as they were donning and doffing their gear, and that expert averaged the times that they spent."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,367.11,375.38,"And in some ways, Justice Ginsburg, that explains why we didn't bring the Daubert motion that Justice Kennedy asked about because the methodology isn't inherently flawed."
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,444.23,449.4,"Mr. Phillips, you say the question is whether it can proceed as a class."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,483.49,483.62,No.
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,498.26,502.46,"But the Rule 23 inquiry, Mr. Phillips, is always dependent on what the substantive law is."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,502.46,502.82,Right.
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,503.73,510.87,"That was true in Halliburton where we said, look, if we didn't have the basic presumption, we would think of this as very individualized."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,510.87,510.96,Right.
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,510.96,519.04,"But we have the basic presumption, so the proof is not individualized. And the same thing, it seems to me, is true here because of the Mt. Clemens inquiry."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,519.04,519.29,Right.
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,519.29,530.62,"Where it says if the employer hasn't kept the appropriate records, even a single plaintiff can prove the amount of work done through the use of statistical --"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,530.62,532.94,"That's not what Mt. Clemens says, Justice Kagan."
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,558.875,563.375,I can't see how that account of Mt. Clemens would make most -- much sense.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,580.97,584.35,I think that's exactly the line the Court drew in Mt. Clemens.
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,589.85,592.63,But you've changed your theory.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,625.015,626.36,To be sure.
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.49,641.77,Right.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,668.17,668.55,Right.
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.55,677.24,And then it says the employer can't complain that the damages lack the exactness and precision of measurement that would be possible had he kept records.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,682.52,684.84,There are two answers to that.
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,693.62,693.875,Yeah.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,693.875,699.215,None of these employee -- a huge number of these employees have not made that showing.
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,699.215,700.785,"Well, they did through statistics."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,701.14,701.27,No.
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.37,702.97,"I mean, you say an antitrust case."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,744.175,750.69,"But Justice Breyer, your -- your entire hypothetical is premised on the fact that they had already shown that they were injured in the first --"
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,750.69,760.79,"Well, some of them, it might turn out, actually did not wear sneakers during the period of time that the conspiracy has been shown to exist."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,790.26,790.96,"No, because --"
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.96,791.28,Why not?
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,791.28,798.99,"-- because there's a -- I mean, the class certification decision is still open until the final -- until a judgment is rendered by the district court."
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.02,829.82,"But why decertify the class? If we've shown or we do show the conspiracy lasted from January until June, not through December? Some people will recover; other people will not recover. Can't we wait until the evidence is presented before we tell the people who didn't --"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,829.82,830.6,"But see, the problem --"
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.6,832.025,"-- buy the sneakers, then you don't recover?"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,832.025,844.08,"The -- the problem with this -- and this would raise exactly the same Comcast problem -- is my guess is your expert testified about the conspiracy that lasted through the entire period. And for whatever reason the jury rejected it, just as it rejected Mericle in this case."
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,861.69,862.35,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,874.155,874.92,"Yes, there are."
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,874.92,875.79,All right.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,885.625,889.09,But -- but only because -- she didn't do that to say who's over 40.
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,900.19,902.01,"Well, you didn't have an expert to say that?"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,902.01,903.33,We didn't need an expert to say that.
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,909.4,910.3,Is there any -- there any -- reject --
2015.14-1146,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,910.3,933.515,"Is there any way at this point to determine which employees were actually injured and which ones were not? Because I -- I gathered because the jury rejected the full verdict that was requested by the plaintiffs, they did not accept Dr. Mericle's testimony regarding the amount of time needed to don and doff for employees in various categories."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,945.47,946.91,It -- it's impossible to do that.
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,963.44,966.54,But the briefs are like two ships passing in the night on this point.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,970.84,973.28,I would be shocked if he's prepared to accept a remand.
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.03,976.975,Aren't there further proceedings?
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,976.975,977.77,I don't --
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,977.77,980.06,Aren't there further proceedings in this case?
2015.14-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,980.06,981.325,It -- it was a lump sum.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,981.325,983.5,"It was a lump sum judgment, Your Honor."
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,983.5,985.96,And now that has to be distributed.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,989.41,995.3,It is far from clear how it's going to be -- how it's going to be dealt with at this point other than on a pro rata basis.
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,995.82,998.295,But that has to be determined in the trial court.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,998.295,999.135,I'm sorry?
2015.14-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,999.135,1001.805,But that has to be determined in the trial court.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1001.805,1004.48,It's far from clear what the trial court --
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1004.48,1005.07,Mr. Phillips --
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1005.07,1008.09,-- if the trial court has any intention to do anything with this other than to accept the check.
2015.14-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.09,1008.52,I don't understand.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1020.415,1021.94,"Well, you can't do that."
2015.14-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.44,1026.29,-- class to begin with.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1026.29,1029.56,But you can't -- you can't unscramble this egg at this point.
2015.14-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1030.98,1038.02,"You have conceded that the initial certification was okay because at that time, we didn't know which ones --"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1038.02,1040.15,"Well, I wouldn't say we conceded that."
2015.14-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1056.53,1063.36,"But didn't you say that in general, a class could be certified going in, even though at that point, we don't know?"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1063.36,1064.13,No.
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.77,1074.11,I'm still having the same problem.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1102.25,1102.68,But the --
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1102.68,1105.17,I thought that's the most common thing in the world.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1105.49,1115.67,"But the problem is -- yes, you are, Justice Breyer, because the problem there is the expert who testified to the conspiracy would have assumed that the conspiracy covered the entire time of --"
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1115.67,1115.9,That's right.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1115.9,1116.51,-- proof.
2015.14-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1126.6,1126.94,Yes.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1126.94,1132.76,And there's no way to know who was injured in that context and who was not injured in that context.
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1132.76,1133.06,But there --
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1133.06,1134.76,You can't identify the people to pay.
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1134.76,1135.97,"But, Mr. Phillips, there is a way."
2015.14-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1135.97,1137.23,Justice Sotomayor.
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1137.23,1141.95,Why do you have standing? I mean --
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1141.95,1142.29,Because --
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1142.29,1145.46,"-- the jury, obviously, rejected something."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1165.5,1166.42,Respondent didn't raise that.
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1166.42,1173.785,-- to argue that the issue of who gets part of that money?
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1173.785,1176.54,Phillips Petroleum says we clearly have standing to do that because --
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1176.54,1176.915,Why?
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1176.915,1183.84,Because our concern is that we -- that -- that the class be bound by whatever judgment comes out of this.
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1189.84,1191.62,"You tell me, except for those people --"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1191.62,1191.94,Plaintiffs.
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1191.94,1196.455,"-- who opted out, there are people who opted in?"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1196.455,1200.62,"The Fair Labor Standards Act people opted in, yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1200.62,1207.27,"Opted in. So you know all of the people who are bound, all the people who've opt -- who were -- who opted in."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1207.27,1207.75,"No, no."
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1207.75,1209.64,So why do you have to know whether -- there can't be more.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1209.64,1210.42,"No, no, no, no, no."
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1220.7,1223.89,They were allowed to participate; they just didn't opt in.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1223.89,1238.44,"Well others -- but others didn't -- that's -- that's true, but the -- but the bottom line here remains the same, which is, they are absent class members whose interests were -- may -- may have not been fully protected, and the only question there is do we have standing to raise this issue, which --"
2015.14-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1238.44,1245.735,"I've never heard of a case where absent class members are somehow bound by a judgment in this case, when they didn't opt in."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1251.375,1265.13,"If it's a class judgment and you -- and you didn't opt out -- I mean, there are two different classes here, right? There is a 23(b)(3) class, and there's the FSLA collective action, which have now been merged in on the judgment."
2015.14-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1300.69,1311.49,"Mr. Phillips, do you have -- do you have a theory as to why the jury awarded less than half of the damages that were requested? Did they -- I take it they didn't identify particular workers."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1311.49,1313.3,They did not identify particular workers.
2015.14-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1313.3,1317.68,"Did they -- did they disagree with the 18 minutes, 21 minutes?"
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1317.68,1328.55,"They had to have disagreed with it, and there was good reason to do that because if you -- if you take the testimony of the four named plaintiffs, they -- they were significantly different than the -- than the 18 and 21 minute times."
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1358.975,1386.28,"If I could go back to Justice Kennedy's question at the start, because it really was your decision not to have a bifurcated proceeding, where it would have been clear -- it would have been proved separately in a highly ministerial way which employees worked over 40 hours. And having made that decision, you're in a position now where you're saying, oh, there's one sum -- there's one lump judgment; we don't know what to do with it."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1410.75,1416.75,"The -- the bifurcation that the plaintiffs proposed, two things to say about that. First of all, they took it off the table themselves, not us."
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1458.15,1469.055,"But it -- it absolutely helps with the question, your second question presented, which is this point that you are making that there might be some people who didn't work 40 hours, who would nonetheless get money."
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1475.94,1476.22,Right.
2015.14-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1476.22,1479.78,-- which is this question about was the class too varied.
2015.14-1146,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1493.415,1505.51,"And -- and my answer to the Mt. Clemens one, which, obviously, I'm not persuading you on, is that if -- the way I read Mt. Clemens, it says, you don't go to fair and reasonable inference on -- on the liability phase."
2015.14-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.02,1534.46,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1534.46,1567.86,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start with your question, Justice Kennedy, because there absolutely will be remand proceedings on the presumption that you affirm the judgment of the Eighth Circuit so that the money can be allocated, and we know the names of every single person who would be entitled to an award based on a very long spreadsheet that Dr. Fox compiled in conjunction with Dr. Mericle's analysis. And so you're right, Justice Kagan, that there is a pot of money based on the jury verdict that will be allocated, assuming that the Court affirms the class certification judgment."
2015.14-1146,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1567.86,1570.16,"Well, there is no question the money can be divided up."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1617.1,1711.93,"Well, there are two ways, and I would submit that they -- neither is slap-dash. Ordinarily, we would defer to jury verdicts, and we would say that if the jury evaluated the evidence within the realm of what was presented at trial, that is going to get special deference in our legal system. So when those monies get allocated, ordinarily a district judge is going to do so on a basis either of pro rata for all of those -- all of those plaintiffs who were found to be injured, and the 212 who were identified by name, by Dr. Fox, Tyson knew about them before trial, did not move for summary judgment as to those 212, could have easily severed them right out before this case went to the jury. The second way is that Dr. Fox did an analysis using Mericle's averages and then added them to the number of minutes worked by the particular employee, and so based on that, a vast number got above the 40-hour threshold. Now, the evidence at trial that it came in by Tyson's own witnesses was that the average worker worked 48 hours per week before you even got to any of the counting of the donning and doffing, and that the plant ran on Saturdays 60 percent of the time, which would be a 6-day work week. And so the evidence as the jury considered it found the vast majority of the class members were already going to be in overtime status, and that's why the fulcrum of the case came down to whether putting on this gear, which was standard sanitary gear for every single worker in the class, was compensable or not."
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.93,1719.1,"Counsel, we don't know why the jury reduced the requested damages by -- gave less than half."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1758.7,1762.47,"Well, and Tyson had an opportunity to ask for more specific instructions."
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1768.115,1778.475,"Well, if you have -- you have -- I understand that, but you have a substantive answer because it's one thing for us to write an opinion saying this is a horrible problem, but they didn't ask for instructions, so don't worry about it."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1778.475,1778.83,"Well, I don't --"
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.83,1779.46,That's another thing.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1786.96,1787.26,Yeah.
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1807.21,1808.89,That sounds like the same answer you gave before.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1808.89,1809.27,"No, but -- but --"
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.27,1810.92,Is there a substantive? Yes.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1821.12,1831.8,"Substantively, the way this is handled typically is that you would do a pro rata distribution of the jury proceeds to the members who are found to have been injured."
2015.14-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1834.54,1836.79,But I'm actually puzzled by the same thing.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1880.965,1884.36,"Well, let me -- let me address that question in this way because I do want to --"
2015.14-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.36,1885.64,Is that the substantive issue?
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1885.64,1887.075,I -- I think it is not.
2015.14-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1887.075,1887.39,Okay.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1887.39,1888.0,Because we --
2015.14-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.0,1888.55,Then skip it. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1888.55,1902.025,"Because we had additional information testimony. And Mr. Chief Justice, on the variations, I think it's important to take into account what actually is going on with these Dr. Mericle observations about the 30 seconds versus the 10 minutes."
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.87,1931.6,"And I suppose some of them like to chat while they're putting on the equipment, and others are more down to, you know, let's get this on as quickly as possible."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1936.835,1938.48,And that's what the district court rejected.
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1941.14,1944.82,"Well, there was not evidence to support that they'd have different equipment that they put on?"
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1944.82,1946.18,It was minimal.
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2021.44,2028.605,"So -- so your -- your submission is that, in fact -- well, what -- what about 18 and 21? You must have thought there was some difference."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2028.605,2035.08,"Well, they were walking to a different part, and they were divided into -- they did have additional equipment in that one."
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.21,2064.04,"So -- so the variation that is -- at least troubled some of us, 30 seconds, 10 minutes, you're saying it's not because the 30-second person is actually going to spend 9 1/2 minutes at the end of the walk, and the 10-minute person spent all the time at the beginning of the walk, and there's no difference between the people who clean up and the people who actually slaughter the hogs because the clean-up people are going to slaughter the hogs at four hours at the end of the shift."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2064.58,2068.9,There was rotation among -- and their own witness testified to that effect.
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2092.57,2106.025,"So -- so we should -- again, there's a -- a basic issue that's presented, but you're saying in addition to avoiding it because of the objection is their lack of objections at all, we should not be reaching the substantive issue because, in fact, there was no variation in the time?"
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2106.025,2108.56,That's what the -- both courts below found.
2015.14-1146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2121.9,2133.355,"Is it an argument that if the employer wants to be quite conscientious about complying with FLSA, the employer has to take some averages."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2147.55,2156.79,"Well, had this -- had the employer kept records, this would be a completely easy case for class certification purposes because every single issue would be done by common proof."
2015.14-1146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2156.79,2169.33,"Can the employer be charged with not keeping adequate records by not following every single person every part of that person's day? You spend four hours on this line, four hours on that line."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2177.12,2178.96,"It's actually simpler than that, Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-1146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.61,2219.605,Many workers put on gear other than sanitary gear.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2236.73,2237.17,Right.
2015.14-1146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.49,2268.395,I don't -- I don't think your -- your friend will agree that it's basically the same gear.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2268.395,2269.77,"Well, I wouldn't expect that."
2015.14-1146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.77,2272.455,"I think that's his -- his point, that it's quite different gear."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2272.455,2287.74,"But the -- what the district court found, and they didn't show -- look, we're talking about a difference between a Kevlar belly guard and a Plexiglas belly guard or a mesh, metal mesh belly guard. We're talking about the same basic kinds of gear."
2015.14-1146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.04,2311.935,"Well, the difference -- the question is not whether they're -- whether one protective gear is different from another, but it's whether protective gear is different from sanitary gear. That's the question."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2311.935,2313.485,"Well, the question is --"
2015.14-1146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2313.485,2319.62,"Wasn't there -- wasn't there -- for all of the workers, there was certain basic equipment."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2330.615,2331.66,That's -- that's --
2015.14-1146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.66,2334.8,The basic protective gear was the same for everybody.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2334.8,2335.5,That's correct.
2015.14-1146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.93,2339.74,What was that? What was that basic protective gear that everybody --
2015.14-1146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2339.74,2344.01,"Hard hats, ear plugs or ear muffs, and boots."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2344.01,2345.545,"Thank you, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.545,2347.82,What was it? (Laughter.)
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2347.82,2349.26,Let's see if you remember what she said.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2353.09,2359.47,"Hard hats, ear plugs, hair nets, beard nets, and basic smocks."
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2359.47,2359.98,And -- but the --
2015.14-1146,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2359.98,2360.455,And boots.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2360.455,2361.17,And boots.
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2361.94,2364.07,You left boots out. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2364.07,2367.76,But -- but the knife wielders had a lot more than that.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2367.76,2368.255,Right.
2015.14-1146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2383.93,2401.77,"It seems -- it seems to me that you might concede that if this were simply a class action under 23, that these problems might be a barrier to certification, but that under Mt. Clemens you have a special rule; is that --"
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2401.77,2402.49,We certainly --
2015.14-1146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2402.49,2413.97,"Is that correct? Do you -- do you concede that there is a strong possibility you might not be -- have this class certified under section -- under Rule 23, absent Mt. Clemens?"
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2413.97,2418.085,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think Mt. Clemens answers the question in this case."
2015.14-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2429.65,2429.82,Okay.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2472.085,2486.615,"Well, Justice Breyer, we do agree with that position, but we also agree with Justice Kennedy that, because of the Mt. Clemens framework overlay for Fair Labor Standards Act, this is an easier case than a case in which there was not that substantive law difference."
2015.14-1146,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2501.04,2528.76,"Mr. Frederick, I -- I'm not sure that you've answered the -- the two substantive questions that I see my colleagues asking, okay? With respect to whether you're a knife wielder or not, if you are assigned to -- to bear a knife during the day, you're going to be paid for that time anyway because you're on the start-to-end day, okay? So you're not going to get FSLA for that."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2534.095,2538.5,"Well, actually, Justice Sotomayor, that's where I would disagree with you, because --"
2015.14-1146,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2538.5,2538.82,All right.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2538.82,2548.27,"-- if -- if the worker, through habit, convenience, is doffing while walking, our study didn't double count."
2015.14-1146,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2572.54,2603.28,"Could I just ask you to clarify something before your time runs out, because it -- it's unclear to me from what you've said in your argument. Why did Dr. Mericle come up with one figure for employees on the processing floor and another figure for employees on the slaughter floor if, as I understand you to have said this morning, all of the employees basically do both of those tasks and spend an equal amount of time on them, so they can all be considered together?"
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2603.28,2606.91,"I didn't say that, and if I did, I was -- I misspoke."
2015.14-1146,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2606.91,2608.74,"Well, that was the impression I got from what you said."
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2608.74,2615.93,"Within the department, they would perform different tasks, some of which would require knife and some which didn't."
2015.14-1146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2656.7,2674.165,"Let me ask you this: If the Court is writing an opinion of reaching the result you want, what is the standard we put? Representative evidence? Average evidence of injury is sufficient if? What -- what do we write?"
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2674.165,2700.54,"I think what you write, Justice Kennedy, is that in this context, where there was an expert who said that the averages -- they clustered around the averages, and that based on observations where the work activity, the donning and doffing that is contested here is occurring in three different places, it's fair to treat the employers because the FLSA is a remedial statute that is designed to protect workers who can't keep these kinds of records."
2015.14-1146,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2701.09,2705.405,And that's -- that's a little bit too specific for the broad standard that I'm looking for.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2715.25,2723.3,"Well, I think every case is going to be different, as we would all candidly recognize, that an antitrust case is going to be different from a labor case."
2015.14-1146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2733.905,2740.815,Don't you also have to say that the jury accepted the averaging? And that doesn't seem to have happened here.
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2740.815,2741.24,Well --
2015.14-1146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.24,2751.39,"When the jury comes in with -- with less than half of -- of what the averaging would have produced, how can we say that there has been averaging?"
2015.14-1146,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2751.39,2764.325,"The averaging, I think you should infer from the jury's award of damages to the injured -- and it was instructed not to give damages to the uninjured workers, and was faithfully charged with that."

2015.14-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2824.68,2831.5,Do you think -- how do you know they relied on the representative evidence? The number was -- was more than 50 percent of what was asked.
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,2851.09,2884.405,"Well, I think it calls into question whether the jury agreed with the actual time estimates, but I don't think it undermines the conclusion that they found that there was proper representative evidence here because they were instructed that they couldn't award a recovery to the class until all of the nontestifying employees, unless they were convinced that they all performed substantially similar activities. So I think we have to infer that the jury found that all of these activities were similar, that there were not material differences of the kind that Mr. Phillips has referred to today, because the jury was instructed that that was the only way they could award class-wide -- find a -- a finding here of class-wide liability."
2015.14-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2884.405,2890.215,"Well, but they -- they saw the evidence on which the calculations were based, right?"
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,2890.215,2890.9,That's correct.
2015.14-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.9,2894.165,They saw the donning and doffing of the sanitary gear and the protective gear.
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,2902.62,2904.73,I don't think they would have had any basis to do so.
2015.14-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2992.365,3004.435,"And maybe you don't know because you're the -- in an amicus posture, but was the person who normally is, like, hosing down the floor paid as much as the person who performs the most intricate knifing operation?"

2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,3016.83,3021.785,"Well, the jury concluded here that those jobs didn't require materially different gear."
2015.14-1146,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3060.55,3071.505,"Do you concede that if this were a Rule 23 action and the FSLA were not involved that it would be a much closer, much more difficult case?"
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,3071.505,3071.88,Yes.
2015.14-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3093.7,3099.905,"You -- you agree it would be an extension of Mt. Clemens to apply it at the liability stage as opposed to the damages stage, right?"
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,3099.905,3104.68,I think there's a way to read Mt. Clemens where the -- this -- where it would not be an extension.
2015.14-1146,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3165.83,3189.715,"I'm -- I'm going to try to phrase what I understand the question my colleagues have been posing that I don't think either counsel has sort of gotten at, or maybe it's so obvious that we're missing it, okay? Clearly, the expert here, Dr. Joy, said -- I'm using a hypothetical -- there's 10 minutes of overtime."
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,3226.36,3229.43,"The answer is that we don't know for sure, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-1146,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3229.43,3231.11,That's what my colleagues are saying.
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,3261.545,3273.97,"Well, I think that it's not clear yet exactly how the award will be allocated, and those will be left to the district court's discretion when the case returns for allocation. At that point, Tyson can come in and it can make these arguments if it thinks it's unfair."
2015.14-1146,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3284.73,3288.7,Why would -- why would Tyson's care? They have to pay the same amount of dollars.
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,3288.7,3303.265,"Exactly, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that that shows that Tyson might not have the requisite stake here to be able to challenge the allocation. But I think the overarching point to keep in mind is that the -- the issues with allocating this award were not the inevitable result of the class action mechanism."
2015.14-1146,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3346.69,3356.54,"What happened to the -- the government's action? I mean, the government started this against Tyson's or its predecessor and got an injunction."
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,3368.625,3373.045,"Well, ultimately, the government ended up settling the claims in that prior enforcement action."

2015.14-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3398.145,3398.515,No.
2015.14-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3399.225,3434.21,"What do you think an employer should do about recordkeeping when the employer believes that certain activities need not be counted under the FLSA? So is the employer -- it may be that the employer is stuck with the choice that it makes, the legal judgment it makes. But is it supposed to keep two sets of -- of records so the amount of time that it thinks the employee is entitled to compensation for, and then this additional amount of time, that it might be argued that the employee is entitled to compensation for?"
2015.14-1146,2,56054,elizabeth_prelogar,,3434.21,3452.255,"Well, Mt. Clemens does make clear that the employer is stuck with its mistake because it said even when the failure to keep records grows out of a bona fide mistake about whether the time should be compensable whether it was work, that still the burden-shifting framework applies. But I would also note here that I think there was no legitimate argument here that this wasn't work."

Let me answer Justice Alito's point and the -- and the observation where -- I mean, the reality is, is that in the Reich litigation, we were told that the -- the ordinary sanitary equipment was not -- was not within the donning and doffing requirements, and never a problem."
2015.14-1146,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3536.94,3542.44,"Yeah, but you're -- you're saying the district court made a finding that there were great dissimilarities."
2015.14-1146,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3542.44,3544.08,"Yes, Your Honor, it did."

2015.14-1146,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3581.83,3585.765,Didn't they standardize walking time? That's what I thought they used.
