1990.89-7376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.957,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-7376, Pearly L. Wilson v. Richard Seiter."
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,30.07,34.325,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.893,355.917,"Are we talking, Ms. Alexander, about a comparative lack of heat or a total lack of heat?"
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,357.669,365.123,The... there are several affidavits in support of petitioner that make slightly different claims.
1990.89-7376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.887,418.493,"And when you say that, are you implying that you would accept a test that included deliberate indifference as one of the components?"
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,418.493,425.327,"Your Honor, our position is that for continuing conditions of confinement no state of mind test is relevant."
1990.89-7376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,442.02,447.913,"But you can tell... you can make that determination by looking at objective factors, can't you?"
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,454.009,469.199,"That... our position is that in fact, while it makes much more doctrinal sense to simply say for continuing conditions of confinement no state of mind test, in fact that analysis is going to come out the same way."
1990.89-7376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,487.784,495.918,"Well, then you say that if something is unintentional, completely unforeseeable by the officials, it is necessarily cruel and unusual punishment?"
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,495.918,500.06,Short-term conditions raise different issues.
1990.89-7376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,500.801,503.615,"Well, then we have one test for short-term conditions and another for long term?"
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,503.615,513.86,"--In this sense, in the Rhodes... in both Hutto and in Rhodes this Court said the conditions of confinement are punishment."
1990.89-7376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,553.49,556.512,But there is also a showing of deliberate indifference.
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,556.512,557.674,--I would agree with that.
1990.89-7376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.674,563.728,Because you use objective facts to determine an institutional state of mind.
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,563.728,568.102,I would agree that the tests come out exact... precisely the same.
1990.89-7376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.824,605.909,"Why is it part of the punishment after 3 years and not after, you know... I just don't understand that at all."
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,634.928,638.64,"Your Honor, if I could respond to your second question regarding the language in Whitley first."
1990.89-7376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.64,638.791,--Yes.
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,639.809,648.605,"The first thing is that the language, obdurate and wantonness, it was quoted at that point in Whitley, comes first from Gregg v. Georgia and later from Rhodes v. Chapman."
1990.89-7376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.27,675.537,"Well, what about the phrase, not only it is obduracy and wantonness, but it goes on to say not inadvertence or error in good faith."
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,679.449,687.655,It seems to me that the other way to reconcile that dictum in Whitley is to say that the precise language that the Court was using at that point was conduct.
1990.89-7376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.621,722.492,"Yes, but you can say that it reconciles them by the simple fact that when it goes on for a long time you can more easily find the absence of inadvertence or error in good faith."
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,739.277,745.561,The distinction reconciles all this Court's cases in the Eighth Amendment area.
1990.89-7376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.254,753.637,"Well, blue-eyed defendants might do it, too, but what's the reason for long term-short term?"
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,762.117,770.633,"--I agree that if one, if courts go through the analysis on long-term events they will always come to the same result."
1990.89-7376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,837.093,852.503,"Well, Ms. Alexander, in, certainly in Estelle against Gamble, where there was a claim based on failure to render medical care to prisoners, the Court followed, as I understand it, a deliberate indifference standard."
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,852.503,853.094,Yes.
1990.89-7376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.094,855.057,A state of mind component.
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,855.057,855.495,Yes.
1990.89-7376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,903.008,910.846,"Well, don't you think the deliberate indifference standard would apply to a long-term neglect of medical care needs as well?"
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,910.846,914.055,"No, because given... the only point--"
1990.89-7376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,914.055,915.848,Would it reach the same result?
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,915.848,917.158,--You would reach the same result.
1990.89-7376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.01,935.843,"Ms. Alexander, you've confused me now."
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,958.132,959.213,"I apologize, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.433,970.413,Even to one prisoner?
1990.89-7376,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,970.413,971.474,--Even to one prisoner.
1990.89-7376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.986,979.137,"Thank you, Ms. Alexander."
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,981.348,988.113,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.96,1026.07,Not even negligence?
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1029.857,1032.41,--Not... there is no need to inquire into the reason.
1990.89-7376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.792,1038.817,What if you have a hurricane and all the lights go out in the prison and there is just no air conditioning.
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1042.47,1047.244,"--That, Your Honor, that is not what we would consider to be the prison conditions."
1990.89-7376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.915,1063.137,"--More specifically, it's not a product of anybody's negligence or deliberateness."
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1063.137,1075.125,"--Your Honor, the reason we... the reason we resist the notion of negligence or resist deliberateness is simply this, and it's really... it comes down to the class of cases that we are particularly concerned about here."
1990.89-7376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1108.89,1110.402,But we could say that the State is.
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1113.725,1113.895,--You could.
1990.89-7376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1145.167,1148.249,--I don't consider it a fiction if the legislature is in default of an obvious duty.
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1148.249,1150.469,"Well, it may be though."
1990.89-7376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.053,1215.025,"Well, Mr. Bryson, you are really submitting quite a broad proposition to the Court, not so much about intent, but the idea that it is a cruel and unusual punishment if prisoners are not provided with minimal, what you regard as minimal, what, food, clothing, shelter?"
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1215.025,1215.736,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1215.736,1218.016,What authority do you have from this Court for that?
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1218.016,1220.118,"Your Honor, we looked to the cases--"
1990.89-7376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1220.118,1222.749,"Go ahead, tell me what the authorities are."
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1222.749,1226.552,"--Yes, well, I would look first to, the best statement is the DeShaney case."
1990.89-7376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1227.894,1230.746,The DeShaney case doesn't deal with the Eighth Amendment.
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1230.746,1231.688,"--Well, it did discuss."
1990.89-7376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.059,1264.041,All you have is dicta in DeShaney for this sweeping proposition?
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1264.041,1264.191,--No.
1990.89-7376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.666,1303.762,But all we granted certiorari in on this case was whether the malicious and sadistic intent requirement.
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1315.812,1315.963,That's right.
1990.89-7376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.684,1344.065,"In Justice Scalia's hypothetical of the hurricane, I take it if the prison warden, in anger at the prisoners, had so arranged the heating and the plumbing that the same conditions applied, you would say that was cruel and unusual, wouldn't you?"
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1349.357,1349.668,Yes.
1990.89-7376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1355.023,1355.904,So cruel and unusual does have an intentional component?
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1355.904,1361.828,"Well, it does in the case in which one person sets out to punish another, even if it is in a single isolated instance."
1990.89-7376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.018,1455.623,But you would leave the Estelle test intact for medical--
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1455.623,1461.088,The Estelle test seems to me to go more to the nature of the medical care that is adequate.
1990.89-7376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.607,1462.749,--And you would leave Whitley in place--
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1462.749,1463.4,"--Oh, Yes, I--"
1990.89-7376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.4,1466.392,--where there is prison security involved?
1990.89-7376,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1466.392,1467.013,"--That's right, yes."
1990.89-7376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1468.062,1471.154,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1473.117,1478.609,Thank you.
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.721,1527.592,"May I just ask, you mentioned financial concerns."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1535.337,1537.099,"No, Your Honor, it clearly would not."
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.081,1538.271,But why not?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1543.836,1549.991,"--Your Honor, I think that would depend on whether the named defendants were the ones that had a culpable state of mind."
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.193,1556.035,"Well, they name everybody on the prison staff, and they are all boy scouts."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1559.957,1568.935,"--I think in that instance, under a 1983 action there would not be a culpable state of mind present on behalf of a named defendant, and yes, there would be no actionable Eighth Amendment conduct."
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.935,1570.466,And who could the... who could the prisoners sue?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1571.677,1573.35,"No, Your Honor, they could sue--"
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.35,1575.861,So there'd be... there would be no remedy in the case I pose then?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1575.861,1578.032,"--To the contrary, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.234,1579.855,What would the remedy--
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1579.855,1582.046,"--within the State courts, if this did not rise to constitutional--"
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.046,1582.236,"--Oh, in the State courts."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1582.236,1582.617,--deprivation.
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.617,1583.919,But there would be no Federal remedy?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1583.919,1589.853,If there was in fact the proper named defendant with a culpable state of mind named--
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1589.853,1592.885,"No, I'm assuming there is nobody who has a culpable state of mind."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1605.286,1607.146,--As alluded to in--
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.146,1608.898,No Federal remedy.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1608.898,1615.363,"--in the earlier questions, there could in fact be a collective state of mind type of inquiry based on--"
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.363,1615.964,On behalf of whom?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1615.964,1617.306,--whether the legislature or the governor--
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.306,1620.148,But who... but who do you sue for that collective state of mind?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1621.17,1624.752,--I believe you could sue the governor or you could sue the legislature itself.
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.752,1628.616,"Well, what if the governor also urged such legislation, but the legislature just wouldn't pass it?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1628.616,1641.995,"The governor does have the ability in a fiscal emergency to take over and appropriate monies where necessary, so in fact that could be a resolution within the Federal judiciary, as well as having the ability to sue the State [inaudible]."
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.995,1653.305,"But he would be guilty of violating the Eighth Amendment if he did not exercise his extraordinary power to appropriate that kind of money, even though he thought it was in the best interest, but as a matter of political philosophy he thought the legislature ought to be doing it?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1653.305,1669.477,"Your Honor, it is, it is the State's position that if there is in fact a condition that constitutes punishment, deprives a basic human need, and is done with a wanton and obdurate state of mind, that that would be the only way in which an Eighth Amendment violation should be able to be made out."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1677.935,1680.566,What if it's lack of medical care?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1684.397,1685.018,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1685.018,1685.979,Deliberate indifference.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1685.979,1686.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1687.251,1689.895,"And why not other prison conditions, then?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1693.279,1699.375,"--When looking at conditions of confinement, Your Honor, there are in fact competing governmental interests at issue."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1702.547,1705.08,"Well, they play a role in medical care too."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1707.432,1719.431,"When this Court looked to the medical claims raised in Estelle v. Gamble, I believe they in fact identified that the interests of the inmate in being free from physical injury were paramount."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.909,1733.962,"But they might involve all those things, actually."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1733.962,1735.084,At the point--
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1735.084,1745.121,If the food were insufficient or the circumstances of incarceration were such that they were subjected to abuse and injury from other prisoners.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1753.639,1755.128,"--That is certainly correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1755.128,1757.189,And why wouldn't you apply the same test?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1757.189,1766.296,"At the point in time when there is a serious medical need that arises that prison officials had been deliberately indifferent to, there would be an actionable Eighth Amendment violation."
1990.89-7376,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.291,1772.861,"They're just inhuman, but they are not medical?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1772.861,1775.214,--If there is no deprivation--
1990.89-7376,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1775.214,1777.356,"That's a very odd line, it seems to me."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1777.356,1782.081,"--Your Honor, if the... the deliberate indifference test should apply when looking at medical needs."
1990.89-7376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.222,1845.135,"But does he contend, Ms. Eppler, that his wrong classification is a cruel and unusual punishment?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1845.135,1850.851,"Your Honor, that is one of the claims that he raises that has... that he has challenged violates the Eighth Amendment."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.85,1929.701,"In the context of a prison riot, of course."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1929.701,1929.992,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1929.992,1939.148,And I thought the opinion was careful to say that it might be some different mental component in other contexts.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1939.148,1939.799,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.799,1943.323,"I thought it referred specifically to Estelle against Gamble, for example."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1943.323,1944.895,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.909,1980.58,Will you help me on this state of mind point?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1991.748,2000.914,"Your Honor, I would submit that the state of mind is equally important whether it is a physical--"
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.914,2004.107,Does it matter to me while I'm being strangled?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2004.107,2009.699,"--Well, it may not matter what the intent of the official is to you--"
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.699,2010.47,Of course it doesn't.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2010.47,2017.655,--It certainly would make equally as much sense to look at the intent of the prison officials in a medical-type of context.
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.655,2021.738,"Well, what other reason would he do it, other than to choke me?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2021.738,2032.467,"Your Honor, in that instance, if an inmate were being choked by a prison official, there is no question but that malicious intent would in almost all instances under that type of hypothetical be implied."
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2032.467,2034.869,You would have to... it would be implied?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2034.869,2035.42,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2035.42,2037.831,But you would have to consider it?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2037.831,2039.022,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.022,2042.134,So what we're arguing about is considering and applying it.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2042.134,2045.037,"Your Honor, I believe what we're... what we are here to consider--"
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2045.037,2052.072,"When they complain about the air coming in the room and freezing them, we have to find out whether they intended that maliciously?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2052.072,2053.342,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.342,2056.864,They did it knowing full well what they were doing.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2064.541,2065.313,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2077.23,2084.396,"Then why isn't it equally true, to go back to Justice O'Connor's question, why isn't it equally appropriate in the medical care context?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2089.319,2105.259,"--Your Honor, the distinction between Estelle and this type of a situation is when you are looking at systemic conditions of confinement there is not yet the type of physical injury or illness that is in fact identifiable in a medical case."
1990.89-7376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.708,2191.461,What test do you think Rhodes against Chapman used?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2194.075,2194.475,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.764,2206.433,I know that.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2218.511,2225.395,I believe this Court did not need to reach that question because they found that there was no deprivation of a basic human need.
1990.89-7376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.198,2257.216,"And you think Rhodes against Chapman has not been overruled or confined to its facts, or anything of the kind, by later cases?"
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2257.216,2266.631,My understanding is that there are no... no decisions since the 1981 decision in Rhodes v. Chapman that either limits it to its facts or in any way overrules that decision.
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.631,2268.564,May I ask you this question about the Rhodes case?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2284.355,2286.368,"What they did objectively in this case, Your Honor?"
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.368,2288.519,"No, what they did objectively in Rhodes against Chapman."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2299.187,2300.588,"No, Your Honor, I still believe--"
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.588,2304.831,"They imposed double-celling because they thought it would make the prisoners uncomfortable, and they wanted to do it to harm them."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2304.831,2307.341,"--In Rhodes v. Chapman, I believe the answer--"
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.341,2307.462,Would that violate--
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2307.462,2307.862,--would be no.
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.435,2312.837,--So the malicious state of mind is not the sole criteria?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2312.837,2313.518,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.518,2316.92,"It's just one of... a necessary, but not a sufficient condition."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2316.92,2317.571,"Correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2358.209,2361.302,"Well, strict liability against action for an injunction."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2365.435,2366.547,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.125,2446.147,"Let me just interrupt you again, if I may."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2458.578,2465.795,"--In those cases, Your Honor, I believe the Court was looking more to the element of whether something was punishment in the constitutional sense--"
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.795,2466.473,Right.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2466.473,2468.656,--and if something is in fact intended as punishment--
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.656,2474.018,But all I'm suggesting is there's no requirement that the State be motivated by any kind of special malicious intent in those cases.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2474.018,2475.75,--In imposing the death penalty--
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.75,2475.921,Yeah.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2475.921,2476.291,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.291,2481.286,So you're... this is just... your argument goes only to confinement cases?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2481.286,2481.806,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.339,2492.637,"Maybe what Justice Stevens' question suggests is that you're wrong to establish, as you did earlier, three separate criteria."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2512.932,2514.872,"It would certainly not be inconsistent with the State's position, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.872,2515.743,--So why don't you do it that way?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2535.859,2541.183,"I think that would still be consistent with the State's position and consistent with the precedents of this Court, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.716,2698.21,I thought that state of mind issues were almost inappropriate for summary judgment.
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2698.21,2706.287,"No, Your Honor, I think this Court has directly recognized in Anderson that state of mind question are certainly appropriate for disposition on summary judgment."
1990.89-7376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.327,2729.434,"That's true of any issue, of any... but if you put state of mind, it seems to me that you are certainly inviting waiting for a jury trial to decide all this."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2729.434,2741.913,"--Your Honor, I think this... in all due deference, I believe this Court has previously recognized in Anderson that there is an ability to decide questions of state of mind on a summary judgment level as well as on a directed verdict level at trial."
1990.89-7376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.913,2747.075,You say that you have a three-step inquiry?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2747.075,2748.076,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.076,2754.621,And any one of them that is missing is fatal to the case?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2754.621,2755.372,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.372,2759.526,Including deprivation of basic conditions of life?
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2759.526,2759.866,That is correct.
1990.89-7376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.031,2876.337,"Ms. Eppler, this wasn't the ground that the court of appeals for the Sixth Circuit went off on, that these things were not deprivations, whatever the state of mind."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2893.218,2903.066,"--Your Honor, I believe what the lower court did was identify that Whitley v. Albers' wantonness and obduracy is what controls the analysis of conditions of confinement claims."
1990.89-7376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2930.816,2940.18,"But wanton and obdurate does... which are the words the court of appeals did use, certainly suggest some sort of subjective inquiry."
1990.89-7376,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,2940.18,2955.28,"Clearly there was an inquiry into state of mind, without question, and the lower court found, correctly, that there was no evidence that could have supported a reasonable jury determination that the prison officials acted with a wanton and obdurate state of mind."
1990.89-7376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.596,3020.216,"Thank you, Ms. Eppler."

1990.89-7376,3,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,3185.891,3192.026,"--The major authority, Your Honor, that I would cite is the Youngburgh case, and that is where I wanted to go next."
1990.89-7376,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.941,3226.193,As against the professional only.
