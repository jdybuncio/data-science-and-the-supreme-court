1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.795,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1942, Erznoznik against Jacksonville."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,44.182,48.152,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,226.662,227.469,"Mr. Maness, Sir."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,227.469,228.907,Yes.
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,228.907,233.123,"If this still had been shown in a close theater, you wouldn’t be here would you?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,233.123,234.709,I would not.
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,234.709,235.331,So?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,235.331,238.441,"This was an ‘R’ rated film, the class of 74."
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,238.441,239.565,Yes.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,247.675,255.152,"Well, the reason, we don't think it’s a time and place issue."
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,275.733,277.778,"Public, public showing is the issue?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,277.778,282.355,As showing on an outdoor movie screen visible from a public place.
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,282.355,296.53,"Wait, Mr. Maness, what if the ordinance merely provided that it would be an offense to exhibit any movie of any kind that was visible from any public street or public place."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,303.426,312.417,I would say it's be equally objectionable because that seeks to in -- assuming that it's declared a public nuisance also.
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.417,317.646,"Yes, the same ordinance as what you have except that it just says any movie of any kind."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,317.646,323.637,"I would say it's an unlawful infringement on protected speech, visual portrayals because --"
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.637,331.504,"Why wouldn't it be a perfectly good ordinance regulating traffic safety, you don't want people driving down the street looking at movies?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,331.504,334.561,"Well, if it were related to traffic safety --"
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.561,335.13,And why wouldn't --
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,335.13,339.756,"Then, well it wouldn’t be unless it was so construed."
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,349.348,352.591,"Yes, visible from any public street."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,352.591,352.835,A movie.
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.835,354.366,"I think any movie, yes."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,354.366,357.679,"Well, I think you’d have to show that there’s some relationship between --"
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.679,360.039,"Oh, wouldn't there be for a rational relationship?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,360.039,363.293,I don't think so.
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,372.215,374.549,"But, generally public streets are traveled, aren't they?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,374.549,375.866,Well?
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,375.866,378.185,More or less.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,378.185,382.115,I would not -- I would say there's no relationship.
1974.73-1942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.624,406.499,"Well, -- for the legislature to make or initially as to which social benefit weighs most heavily if it’s acting rationally?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,406.499,411.939,"Well, if it is -- yes, if it's acting rationally."
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,412.098,421.798,"Why I suppose if the matters if this ordinance could not be applied as the motion picture for example, that was exhibited at the time was Snow White, could it?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,421.798,423.654,"No, it could not."
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,423.654,431.628,"So, to that extent, there's a distinction going would suggest that the purpose of this ordinance does not traffic safety."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,431.628,432.799,Correct.
1974.73-1942,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.27,447.78,"So this ordinance, we would say is more objectionable under the First and the Fourteenth Amendment then it might have it after all it would be."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,447.78,449.14,Much more.
1974.73-1942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.758,454.606,"Well, let me ask you another question."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,469.563,474.402,"Yes, if they'd said that or if the Courts had construed that into it, maybe."
1974.73-1942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.402,480.295,"Well, but why they -- why does the legislature have to say all the reasons behind it?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,486.686,492.245,"Well, the same rationale that we've been talking about in defining word cases."
1974.73-1942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,511.204,511.663,"Well, what do you think of the motives?"
1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,511.663,515.116,What do we care about the motives?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,515.116,515.328,Well --
1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,515.328,515.962,Not his motive --
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,515.962,524.691,"If we are, as I understand the protect -- protection we afford speech in this country."
1974.73-1942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.77,581.221,Would you say that the City of Jacksonville could go beyond what has been called obscene by this Court and make a broader proscription.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,587.446,593.791,"Yes, I think they'd probably could something more obscene then mere nudity."
1974.73-1942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.791,604.479,"Well, something less obscene than what this Court has said can be prohibited by the State within the walls of the theater where everybody is consented to see it."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,604.479,625.126,"Well, that's a very difficult question to answer because I have tried to figure out how this ordinance could have been authoritatively construed in the Florida Courts to achieve a purpose that does not trench upon protected speech and I don’t see how it can."
1974.73-1942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.843,630.914,What is protected speech as you're using it?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,633.035,634.513,No.
1974.73-1942,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.695,660.387,But then you're saying that Jacksonville can't prohibit in an outdoor movie that's projected beyond the walls that of the theater.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,665.635,667.132,"No, I'm not really saying that."
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,686.239,695.643,"But don't you think Mr. Maness, for example that there are circumstances in which a state might say as to an open-air movie."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,708.167,713.925,"They could prohibit it just like they could prohibit outdoor and in other words, they could prohibit outdoor theaters."
1974.73-1942,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,713.925,715.193,In the interest to safety?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,715.193,717.117,I suppose they could.
1974.73-1942,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,720.394,723.998,Can we be so very sure that is what you're talking about?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,723.998,726.991,"Well, I think so, there's we have"
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.991,729.867,"What about that, what about the nude performances in the public park."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,755.484,757.313,"Well, as I read."
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.695,770.008,"So, you would say that’s acceptable?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,770.008,771.728,Acceptable with the proper words --
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.728,775.473,"But it's saying, if you're going to walk down the street, wear some clothes."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,775.473,777.688,"Yes, at this point in history."
1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,780.748,792.794,"Do you think the City could have an ordinance prohibiting soundtracks from operating during hours, let us say after 10 o’clock at night?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,792.794,794.027,"Yes, I think so."
1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,794.027,800.384,Or at anytime that the sound level was over a certain decibel level?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,800.384,801.588,I think so.
1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,801.588,807.816,But what if -- what if the candidates running for public office and he wants to make a speech?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,814.642,818.979,"It is but you know, it's the question who's making the judgment in a --"
1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.979,833.206,"But you concede that if it annoys, if it's loud enough so that rationally it can be said that this annoys a lot of people and maybe affects their hearing but then it can be prohibited."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,833.206,854.028,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'm under the impression that under the rules laid down by this Court that such an ordinance could be narrowly drawn authoritatively construed and upheld."
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.518,879.227,But if the city fathers that what you view the screen is that it's all located that anybody wants to have nice speech of stop and watch the entire movie.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,883.929,884.325,If there was --
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.325,891.02,"To watch the movies and if they're going -- if you want your screen in that location, just don't show x-rated movies."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,898.794,906.655,"Well, if they passed an ordinance such as you're speaking of and related it specifically to traffic problems --"
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.655,908.938,That's not what I'm talking about.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,911.1,913.77,"Alright, if they related the ordinance to children?"
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,921.013,924.334,What would happen to the case as that -- who is watching these movies?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,924.334,928.881,"That, yes, but the children would be outside watching the movies if it was Mary Poppins"
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.881,929.795,"Oh, I know."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,931.735,932.185,No.
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.272,943.73,Agrees to that showing is -- the parents in town object to the screen showing x-rated movies to their children?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,943.73,945.323,"Well, we're not talking about x-rated movie."
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.011,956.203,"Oh, I know but your position covers all -- covers x-rated movies or any other related movie, so let's don’t --"
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,956.203,961.846,So that is an ‘R’ rated movie up to the time to decide whether the child goes or not?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,961.846,962.677,Yes.
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,963.653,968.626,"Well, the child and the parent had no jurisdiction of whether the child stands on the corner, will see it?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,968.626,985.979,"Well, you know we have other laws that such as laws against trespass and littering, and other ways of permitting those who are inside the theater to see what they want to see without interference from those outside the theater."
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,985.979,988.563,But this is restricted to be outside?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,988.563,992.589,"This ordinance is restricted, so restricted yes."
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,992.589,998.926,And it merely says that you shouldn't show this picture to children without their parent's consent?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,998.926,1001.439,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it doesn't mentioned children."
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1001.439,1004.419,I know it doesn't but that’s what happened.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1004.419,1006.376,"Well, I doubt it that’s what happened."
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1006.376,1010.897,But you don't say children are interested in watching ‘R’ rated movies.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1010.897,1013.605,I think the children go in and they want to see it.
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.925,1026.76,"It is beside the point because mine is when the parents say, “Don’t go to that theater.”"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1036.528,1037.512,Well --
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1037.512,1038.84,This is right--
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1038.84,1040.321,That happens.
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.321,1043.19,And that’s part of what this ordinance is aimed at.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1043.19,1044.628,But if he was looking at this --
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.628,1047.067,It isn't part of what this ordinance is aimed at?
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1047.067,1048.075,Yes.
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1084.015,1086.105,Let's get back to my Brother Rehnquist's point.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1093.777,1096.378,"Well, if he recognizes it as such."
1974.73-1942,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1096.378,1099.646,"Well, I would assume that the average person can recognize this."
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1099.646,1103.274,"Well, I've driven by these movie screens."
1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1116.376,1129.456,You're suggesting that in order to sustain one statute it must be demonstrated that it's reaches perfect candidate to either that or in combination with other statutes.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1137.652,1138.551,No.
1974.73-1942,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.49,1146.707,Statutes against murder is to survive eventhough in murders are continued at a very great rate.
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1146.707,1153.718,"And we define the degrees of murder, first, second, third, manslaughter, justifiable or excusable homicide."
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.904,1174.373,"Mr. Maness, what is the consequence of under this ordinance if the establishment is declared a nuisance?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1179.673,1181.236,It's a low grade misdemeanor.
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.819,1187.161,Showing of --
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1187.161,1192.755,"It subjects the projectionist or the manager or ticket taker, someone of those to a criminal penalty."
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.755,1209.18,"Well, so that the word nuisance in there is sort of passage in the sense the ordinance could've said, whoever shows on a screen visible to the public street commits a misdemeanor?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1209.18,1211.635,I would say that that's pretty much correct but --
1974.73-1942,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.635,1217.505,"But it doesn't -- I mean, it doesn't have the consequence, ordinary consequence with news of being able to shut it down?"
1974.73-1942,0,45577,william_h_maness,,1217.505,1218.056,No.
