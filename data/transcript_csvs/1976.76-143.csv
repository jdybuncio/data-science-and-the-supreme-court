1976.76-143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.405,"We'll hear arguments next in 76-143, Splawn against California."
1976.76-143,0,17188,arthur_wells_jr,,53.307,54.479,Thank you.
1976.76-143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,100.391,106.824,Is there -- is there any dispute or issue remaining about whether this is obscenity in this case?
1976.76-143,0,17188,arthur_wells_jr,,108.175,112.687,"No, I -- I don't think it -- the issue of whether its obscenity is out of the case."
1976.76-143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.47,296.725,"Mr. Wells, let me just ask you primarily question."
1976.76-143,0,17188,arthur_wells_jr,,301.215,308.874,"No, you did not grant cert on that issue and I did not brief that issue in the brief and I do not intend to address myself to that question."
1976.76-143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,946.524,959.776,Is there any evidence in the record here Mr. Wells as to whether this retailer ran a totally what you might call adult bookstore or whether he had an adult section and non-adult section?
1976.76-143,0,17188,arthur_wells_jr,,959.776,961.693,There is no direct evidence in the record.
1976.76-143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1366.673,1368.018,"Very well, Mr. Wells."
1976.76-143,0,17188,arthur_wells_jr,,1368.018,1375.186,Thank you.
1976.76-143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1375.186,1377.369,Mr. Stein?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,1377.369,1380.359,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.76-143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1705.116,1708.059,Am I right in thinking that the Redwood City is a county seeded cemetery?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,1708.059,1708.549,That's correct.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.084,1873.274,"Mr. Stein, just before you leave the instruction, do you submit the instruction as proper as given?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,1873.274,1875.252,"I do, yes."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.252,1886.119,"And -- and the instruction as I read it says that simply on the basis of emphasis, sole emphasis that you have cited that word of the sexually provocative aspect to the publication."
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,1903.111,1913.182,"No, they concluded that that's correct, if they concluded that his sole emphasis was on the sexually provocative aspect of the film, it could justify the conclusion that it was utterly without redeeming social value."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.494,1917.231,Do you think that's a correct statement?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,1917.231,1917.395,I think it is.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.395,1917.952,You were stating --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,1917.952,1934.045,"I think it is in the sense that this case where they were further instructed of course that as into the Roth Memoirs definition that's -- I don't want to bore the Court by rereading Roth Memoirs, but it -- that they had to find lack of social importance beyond a reasonable doubt."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.932,1950.271,"But it says it, doesn't it?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,1978.599,1982.691,"Okay, now I'm focusing on your problem."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.409,2030.663,"I -- I suppose you have three kinds of material, obscene as a matter of law, the clearly not obscene --"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2030.663,2034.982,"Clearly not obscene, clearly protected, I think that's important to remember --"
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.982,2040.128,"An area in between that's arguably protected and arguably obscene, is that what we have here?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2040.128,2044.0,"By definition, that's what we have here at least -- at least that because in California"
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.0,2048.929,"But for purpose of our decision, do we assume that it's in that area since the judge said that --"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2048.929,2052.829,Not only do you have to assume and I think you're bounded and you have to because --
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.829,2053.212,Well then --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2053.212,2053.768,-- under the California procedure --
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.768,2062.239,"-- when you're in an arguable area, let's say we don't have Time Magazine but we have Playboy something that's much closer to the line."
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2074.056,2081.054,"That's correct but as you point out, -- that's correct as to social importance of the material, true."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.238,2111.265,Do you agree with your opponent that there's a distinction between sexually provocative material and prurient material?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2111.265,2112.245,"Oh, sure."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.245,2118.384,"That -- that -- there are entirely separate elements and this instruction only talks about the sexual provocative, it doesn't talk about prurient."
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2118.384,2124.173,That's correct and the jury was specifically instructed that this instruction only went to the social value not to the prurients of the material.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.173,2124.758,Right.
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2124.758,2127.83,He can't make a prurient by telling you it's prurient.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.83,2136.15,"And am I also correct in understanding that in California, this social importance aspect to the three parts of the test is a question of fact by the jury?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2136.15,2136.668,That's correct.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.668,2138.414,Each of the three parts of the test are questions of fact --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2138.414,2162.631,"Each of the three parts of the test are question for the jury and unlike the federal system and before I came here, I tried to read that instruction given in Hamling, I couldn't find that for my contacts but I did talk to the U.S. Attorney in Southern California who had an instruction that they give in similar case that should be it was quote and I know this right away, that the issue of close case under the federal instructions is a strictly a jury questions."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.751,2216.523,"Could you clarify again for me the preliminary motion, does the judge rule that as a matter of law it is unprotected or does a rule that it is not protected as a matter of law?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2224.582,2240.981,"No, he has to rule that the material is outside the protection of the first -- no, he has to rule -- yes it is -- the matter is then he making -- no, he has to dismiss the prosecution if the material is not obscene as a matter of law."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.538,2254.58,"But -- but when he denies the motion, he does not rule as a matter of law that it is unprotected?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2254.58,2267.332,"No, the defense may be able to show that although the matter is outside the First Amendment, the didn't treat it in the manner which renders it within the Ginzburg of the Roth-Memoirs definition of obscenity."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.332,2274.856,(Inaudible) the jury and we get this instruction and you loose because you had one picture in the magazine?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2274.856,2280.631,"Not at all because if it's only picture in the magazine, the prosecution wouldn't get over the Noroff, I accept it as a matter of law."
1976.76-143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.631,2282.955,Well assuming the judge did --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2282.955,2291.343,"Well, then we go -- then we go on appeal, he's entitled to the same standard as the trial judge has to use under Noroff to review the material on appeal and as I understand it --"
1976.76-143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.343,2299.499,Is he entitled to an appeal from the ruling of the judge at that stage of there?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2299.499,2302.21,Nobody's entitled to raise it on appeal as though --
1976.76-143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.21,2302.787,That's right.
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2303.896,2307.458,Yes and he's entitled to one more before he gets to appeal which --
1976.76-143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.458,2310.041,"It's sort of censorship, isn't it?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2310.041,2310.697,The censorship?
1976.76-143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2310.697,2310.911,Judicial --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2310.911,2311.598,Yes we are --
1976.76-143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2311.598,2312.625,-- (Inaudible) censorship --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2312.625,2314.913,We are censoring material that's outside the First Amendment in California and we would --
1976.76-143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2314.913,2316.835,"That's all it is, the judicial censorship."
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2316.835,2319.297,We would intend to do that.
1976.76-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.42,2347.922,"If -- if this case had arisen before the 1969 Amendment to California law, do you think the instructions given would have been appropriate at that time?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2347.922,2349.176,"Yes, oh yes."
1976.76-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.787,2367.44,And instructions --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2367.44,2367.583,-- prior to that.
1976.76-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.583,2371.854,"-- like this -- instructions like this could have been given, do you know whether or not they were given?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2371.854,2375.704,"No, I'm not aware of any case in which they were given prior to this."
1976.76-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.778,2389.294,Do you read the instruction as merely identifying evidence that is probative?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2389.294,2397.993,"It's probative on the definition of the Roth-Memoirs definition of obscenity, yes."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.993,2401.518,I understand that your opponent says that -- I haven't read the Noroff case.
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2407.48,2407.741,Sure.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.741,2411.588,"So, if the evidence was even admissible, how could the instruction have been given?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2411.588,2418.211,I disagree with that reading of Noroff and I'll leave it to your -- to read it and analyze it yourself.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.441,2491.854,"In other words, this argument assumes that the pandering evidence was proper in a federal prosecution because of the federal statute?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2491.854,2492.403,Yes.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.403,2497.166,"But the Memoirs, the last section of the Memoirs case suggest the contrary isn't it?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2520.681,2520.98,Right.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.98,2532.767,I don't understand how you can rely on the federal statute as the only basis under Ginzburg and Memoirs or pandering evidence being relevant which I understood you'd argue.
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2534.436,2537.115,"No, I'm afraid --"
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.115,2537.4,What I'm --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2537.4,2537.409,-- yes --
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.409,2553.204,"-- suggesting, I think the last part of the Memoirs' opinion is contrary to your argument and if it is, then I wonder if we don't have a California ruling that said as a matter of state law, this evidence was not being admissible and therefore isn't your point correct that this instruction would have been improper?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2553.204,2555.08,No.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.365,2580.708,"Well, therefore, wouldn't -- this is also a state prosecution, wouldn't it follow from that case?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2583.523,2593.966,"No, because the predicate of Noroff is that the material is non--obscene, entitled to First Amendment protection, okay?"
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.407,2601.537,That's right.
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2601.537,2606.995,"That's right and if this material was within the First Amendment, pandering evidence could not have been admitted."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.9,2620.536,Well but if it isn't the case and Noroff then saying that pandering evidence cannot make the difference between material being protected and being --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2620.536,2620.585,Sure --
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.585,2621.267,-- unprotected?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2621.267,2621.944,-- and that's the point.
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2621.944,2625.009,"And here, it did make the difference because the jury followed the instruction."
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2625.009,2630.714,"Here's the point, pandering evidence can't convict the defendant of a crime he didn't commit."
1976.76-143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.513,2661.595,Why -- why in this prosecution was any evidence of pandering put in or why did you need the pandering instruction now?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2663.555,2674.028,Oh the function that it plays is you have recognized the difficulty of placed on the prosecution by Roth-Memoirs to prove a negative beyond a reasonable doubt.
1976.76-143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.165,2706.702,"Under Miller, this is no longer relevant, isn't it?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2706.702,2710.667,"But unfortunately, California still labors under that Roth-Memoirs test."
1976.76-143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.617,2733.841,Are the state's evidence here on pandering and response in part to the effort of the defendant to show that there was a redeeming social value to this material?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2733.841,2741.808,"No, the evidence came in on the case-in-chief on direct and in the matter fact, the only -- the defense moved that the close of the case."
1976.76-143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2741.808,2746.533,"Well, you just said that you have the burden of proof in your case-in-chief to prove the absence?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2746.533,2749.66,That's correct of social values.
1976.76-143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2749.66,2750.861,So that would be the place where it commend.
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2750.861,2752.867,"That's where you have to put it in, right."
1976.76-143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2752.867,2759.603,I'm anticipating in effect to that aspect of California's burden under your --
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2759.603,2776.843,"And the close of the people's case if we have not proven, that we have not -- but at least raise the jury issue on social value, his motion to dismiss would have been granted and we'd be -- well, we wouldn't be here."
1976.76-143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.843,2782.742,(Inaudible) California need any more proof in the materials do you?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2782.742,2785.359,"No, we still recognize as this Court recognize that the --"
1976.76-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.359,2789.302,"It's hard to fail, hard to fail in your proof, isn't it?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2789.302,2790.019,As long as the projector --
1976.76-143,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2790.019,2791.95,"That's on its face, the material."
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2791.95,2794.659,"The projector bulb doesn't fail, we usually do."
1976.76-143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.595,2846.556,"You still have the Roth-Memoirs test in California, is that as a matter of state constitutional law?"
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2846.556,2847.84,That's state statutory law.
1976.76-143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2847.84,2848.192,State statutory law?
1976.76-143,1,46154,william_douglas_stein,,2848.192,2860.961,"Yes, there are statutes that were periodically reacted following this Court's decisions and it stopped at Roth-Memoirs, and it's been hung there."
