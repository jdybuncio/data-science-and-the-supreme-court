1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.34,Now we will hear arguments this morning in Clark against Community for Creative Non-Violence.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,12.136,15.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.212,258.382,"May I ask a couple of preliminary questions, Mr. Bator."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,275.891,300.209,"Your Honor, the district court found explicitly, on the basis of a record that I think substantially supports that finding, that there has been no discrimination in the application of this demonstration; that in fact the Park Service has across the board tried conscientiously to enforce the regulation against sleeping."
1983.82-1998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,316.077,322.794,And the amendment of the regulations was designed to prevent sleeping overnight in the parks?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,322.794,328.697,It was designed to prevent camping and sleeping as a constituent of that camping.
1983.82-1998,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,328.697,334.07,"Mr. Bator, has there ever been a complete ban on demonstrating in Lafayette Park?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,334.07,338.912,"There had been a ban, I believe, back... I don't know when the date--"
1983.82-1998,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,338.912,340.099,"Many, many years ago?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,340.099,345.394,"--Many years ago, there was a complete rule against any demonstration in Lafayette Park."
1983.82-1998,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,345.394,348.142,Would it be the Government's position that that would be perfectly valid?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,348.142,357.2,"Your Honor, it's not this case, and in the case of Lafayette Park I think our position would be that it would be valid, but we luckily do not need to argue that position."
1983.82-1998,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,357.2,362.105,Why do you draw a distinction between sleeping all night and demonstrating all night?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,362.105,383.394,"The composition of the Park Service regulations on that is to maintain a bright line between the round-the-clock vigil and the camping, sleeping activity, and I think that that is responsive to the notion that the round-the-clock vigil is--"
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,383.394,388.08,You mean that there's a bright line between sleeping and not sleeping?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,388.08,391.64,--The bright line is between the round-the-clock--
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,391.64,394.279,How do you tell when somebody's sleeping and when they're not sleeping?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,398.278,401.48,"--Your Honor, the--"
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,401.48,404.276,"I mean, I was worried about that bright line."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,404.276,410.086,--The bright line is between two sorts of activities.
1983.82-1998,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,428.109,436.809,But precisely how do they carry on the round-the-clock vigil between midnight and so on?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,436.809,437.153,How?
1983.82-1998,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,437.153,437.887,How do they do it?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,437.887,443.369,People do maintain round-the-clock vigils in these parks.
1983.82-1998,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.369,443.65,How?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,445.478,447.539,"They stand, they sing, they carry candles."
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.644,464.221,"Well, you could also sit in a chair or lie down, as long as you're not sleeping, is that it?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,464.221,465.063,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,465.063,470.935,So you can enter a tent and lie down and lie there all night--
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,470.935,471.92,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,471.92,473.279,--as long as you don't sleep?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,473.279,474.715,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,474.715,475.324,And you're all right.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,475.324,476.231,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.262,515.245,"Well, may he sleep during the day?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,521.446,528.226,The rule bars sleeping only if it is a constituent of the use of the park for living accommodation purposes.
1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,568.07,578.486,"Is that partly related to the proposition that the park is there for the use of everyone, including hundreds of thousands of tourists that come to Washington--"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,578.486,579.143,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.143,582.11,"--want to take pictures, walk around the flowers?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,582.11,594.854,It has historically been the position of the Park Service that these places simply are not suited for camping because they are so intensely used by so many people for so many different purposes.
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,604.976,607.755,"Mr. Bator, I have trouble."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,622.812,623.312,Right.
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.312,630.37,You did give them a permit to set up tents and to crawl in those tents.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,635.292,636.727,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.18,639.149,You agreed to that.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,646.146,647.787,"--No, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,647.787,651.3,If he just happened to fall off?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,651.3,665.155,"The finding of the Park Service here, Your Honor, Justice Marshall, is that the threat to the parks comes from a regime in which people generally are told that they can stay for a long time and sleep there."
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,668.934,669.715,But they didn't bar that.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,678.117,689.347,"--The judgment of the Park Service is that if you have a rule that you have to maintain an all-night vigil, that is not likely to threaten the park in a serious way."
1983.82-1998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.033,702.749,"Mr. Bator, does any part of the Park Service's liberality in the regulations accommodating demonstrators stem from previous decisions of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,702.749,704.654,"To some extent, yes."
1983.82-1998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.02,729.331,Not cases from this Court?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,729.331,730.097,Not cases from this Court.
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.87,886.394,"Are there some... are there any cases out of this Court... perhaps you've answered in answering Justice Rehnquist, but are there any cases out of this Court that would prevent the Park Service from saying that no tents or sleeping materials will be allowed in the park?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,886.394,891.001,"--We believe, Your Honor, that there are no cases that would squarely prevent that."
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.873,904.417,"I take it that if the regulation were amended to provide that, that you would be in conflict with the Court of Appeals--"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,904.417,904.808,--Right.
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.808,905.339,--judgments?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,905.339,907.306,"Yes, sir, right."
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.789,926.205,"Well, I take it that, since you say that the question is being asked from the wrong direction, I take it that part of your submission is that you could prevent any sleeping materials in the park?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,926.205,928.455,"We believe so, Your Honor."
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.455,930.548,Including tents?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,930.548,944.369,"The Government, we believe, has tried to be, to take a position that does treat generously of the business of demonstration."
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.369,947.399,It goes farther than you think the Constitution requires?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,947.399,950.085,I believe we have gone farther than the Constitution requires.
1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,958.91,973.825,"Under the present regulations, could a person put up a tent, let's say a pup tent that's probably 25 square feet more or less, and leave it there for an indefinite period, under the existing regulations?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,973.825,977.699,"No, Your Honor, you would have to have a permit for that."
1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,977.699,979.871,"No, I mean with a permit, with a permit."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,979.871,983.853,The permits would not allow you to do that indefinitely.
1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,983.853,985.196,How long?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,986.634,990.82,I don't believe the regulation itself contains a time limit.
1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1000.862,1016.762,"If you have 50 pup tents, small pup tents in Lafayette Park for seven days, especially at this time of year, would you say that would interfere with use of the park by other people, visitors, tourists?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1016.762,1035.504,"Yes, sir, and I doubt very much whether all 60... the 60 here were divided between Lafayette Park and the Mall, and this was proposed for December to March, so that the specific judgment that this was a reasonable demonstration involved that set of circumstances."
1983.82-1998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.504,1041.658,"Mr. Bator, may I ask this question about the general rule, assuming... you say you want to look at the general rule."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1066.992,1081.408,"Yes, Your Honor, the Government does feel that it is important and not fundamentally restrictive of the First Amendment to say that one thing cannot go on here at all ever, and that's to move in and sleep overnight."
1983.82-1998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1083.392,1087.078,So that demonstrations of the kind I've described could really be prohibited?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1087.078,1098.791,"--Your Honor, I don't think there is any indication that very large demonstrations cannot go on in Lafayette Park and particularly the Mall without people being allowed to camp there."
1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1244.984,1256.854,"Would you think it would violate the First Amendment if there was a regulation particularly applying to Lafayette Park that no one, no one, could be in that park after midnight until 8:00 o'clock in the morning?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1256.854,1257.713,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1310.598,1321.64,"If I understand it, the demonstrators want to get over the proposition that there are many people who have no place to sleep."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1325.936,1333.668,"Your Honor, we don't think the physical activity of sleeping is important itself in--"
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1333.668,1334.934,Have you ever tried to live without it?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1334.934,1337.496,"--I beg your pardon, Justice Marshall?"
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.496,1339.338,Have you ever tried to live without sleeping?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1339.338,1340.369,"No, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.369,1343.414,Have you ever had to sleep on a grating?
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1343.414,1344.32,"No, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1344.32,1348.49,"Well, these people want you and others to understand that."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1348.49,1351.676,"I understand that, Justice Marshall, and we respect--"
1983.82-1998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1351.676,1355.689,All you have to do is to look out the window of your office and you'll see it every night.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1355.689,1357.736,"--I understand that, Justice Marshall."
1983.82-1998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1482.577,1486.216,"Well, indeed, under the regulation you can pretend to sleep."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1486.216,1487.372,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.786,1514.938,"Well, if it tends to seem trivial, I think the Government has nobody but itself to blame for having gone to such lengths in allowing these things."
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1514.938,1518.938,"Your Honor, the regulations don't say people may pretend to sleep."
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.425,1551.19,"You didn't come up here from those previous judgments, did you?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1551.19,1551.549,"No, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.549,1554.111,So you are stewing in your own juice in some way.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1555.329,1555.814,No.
1983.82-1998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.814,1556.797,May I ask one other question--
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1556.797,1560.514,Could I just say one thing to that?
1983.82-1998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.271,1584.692,--I just wanted to clarify one thing I'm not sure of.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1596.218,1607.511,"Your Honor, the demonstration regulations and the camping regulations do not speak about the problem, if you will, of people sleeping on the bench."
1983.82-1998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.822,1616.977,"But no park district regulations, and we're talking about an area subject to the jurisdiction of the park district?"
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1616.977,1618.367,--As far as I know.
1983.82-1998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.693,1625.426,I wasn't aware of any either.
1983.82-1998,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1630.877,1632.673,"No, sir."
1983.82-1998,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1634.984,1640.982,Mr. Neuborne.
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1640.982,1643.653,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1702.443,1715.611,"If they did not, if the Park Service did not renew after seven days, must they have the burden to show that it's because other people want to use it or can they just cut them off in seven days?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1715.611,1719.296,"Well, one reason why they could cut them off would be that other people wanted to use it."
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1738.788,1744.114,"What if they just decided, seven days is enough for any one demonstration?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1744.114,1746.831,--That's an issue that would be a troublesome one.
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.799,1750.268,Why would it be troublesome?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1750.268,1767.011,"--In all candor, Your Honor, Justice Rehnquist, the position of the demonstrators at that point would be that the Government would be obliged to demonstrate a reason, some justification for why it was necessary to cut the demonstration short."
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.495,1771.29,"Well, what case would you rely on for that proposition?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1771.29,1779.49,"--I would rely on the general notions of the First Amendment, that where expressive activity is at stake the Government ought to demonstrate some need before it cuts it off."
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.49,1783.177,"I don't think that's necessarily true when the Government's dealing with its own property, is it?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1783.177,1790.502,The property of the Government... the suggestion that the parks are the property of the Government is an extraordinary statement.
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.719,1796.702,"Well, who do you think title to the parks is in, Mr. Neuborne?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1796.702,1802.542,"Title to the parks from time immemorial, as this Court said in Haig versus CIO, rests in the people."
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.542,1803.449,I don't think it said--
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1803.449,1804.479,Who engage in First Amendment activity.
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.479,1808.071,--I don't think the Court said that title rested in the people.
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1836.343,1841.513,"If that were factually justified, if indeed a factual basis could be justified--"
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.513,1842.2,"Well, it could be justified."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1855.787,1860.738,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that would be facially valid, Chief Justice Burger."
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1935.864,1940.455,What did you say is the number of tents that could be put up in Lafayette Park?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1940.455,1949.811,"The precise numbers for this demonstration were, as I understand it, 20 tents in a quadrant of Lafayette Park and 40 tents on the Mall."
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1964.148,1967.773,"What about a regulation that no tents, no tents at all, would be allowed?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,1967.773,1971.865,That raises the troublesome question of the Court of Appeals decisions.
1983.82-1998,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2027.827,2028.53,Mr. Neuborne--
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2028.53,2029.201,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2029.201,2030.122,--may I just put a hypothetical.
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2056.549,2057.549,"I hope not, sir, no."
1983.82-1998,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2057.549,2058.33,Sir?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2058.33,2059.877,"I hope not, sir."
1983.82-1998,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2095.581,2096.673,What?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2096.673,2100.922,--Undifferentiated fear of future abusive attempts to use the parks.
1983.82-1998,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2109.403,2126.241,"But if this particular convention was composed of people of very limited or negligible means, wouldn't they have similar objectives to your clients, that they just couldn't afford any of the hotels in Washington?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2126.241,2130.503,"Well, for one thing, there are camp grounds around the Washington area."
1983.82-1998,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2130.503,2132.471,"Your people could have gone there also, couldn't they?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2132.471,2132.862,Yes.
1983.82-1998,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2146.216,2148.934,A message that hotel rates are too high is not a First Amendment expression?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2148.934,2150.276,"--It is, Your Honor."
1983.82-1998,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2216.016,2218.311,You underestimate the resourcefulness of lawyers.
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2223.295,2225.247,"Well, I hope that wouldn't be so."
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.176,2289.283,Are the campers here allowed to have a fire?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2289.283,2290.158,"No, sir."
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2290.158,2324.612,"What if a group came, to extend Justice Powell's illustration, and said that they noticed that the Washington Post had within the last week announced or indicated that prices of restaurants were prohibitive in Washington, too high, and that they then want to assert their view in opposition to and to demonstrate the plight of ordinary people who can't afford to pay $25 or $30 for dinner or $7 for a breakfast, and so they want to have a fire to cook their own breakfast and lunch?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2324.612,2327.675,"Well, Your Honor--"
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2327.675,2329.986,"That's demonstrating a point, isn't it?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2329.986,2336.592,"--Yes, it is, and it is an attempt to reenact a particular plight, and so the hypothetical is well taken."
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2430.758,2450.546,"For First Amendment analysis, is that any different from camping in the park, in Justice Powell's illustration, as a protest against the high rates of hotels, and having fires to cook meals to protest against the high cost of restaurants in Washington?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2450.546,2451.874,"Yes, sir, I think there is a distinction."
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.874,2453.514,How is it distinguishable?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2453.514,2457.513,I think the distinction is... the distinction lies at two points.
1983.82-1998,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2466.399,2477.645,"My hypothesis, you must accept it assuming that the people who are doing what I suggest are just as sincere and just as hard-pressed as your people are."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2482.268,2498.745,"--Well, in that case the question might well be, are there alternative mechanisms to make the point, and how closely is the activity connected with the expression that the demonstrators are attempting to carry out?"
1983.82-1998,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2535.231,2542.463,Approximately how many people pass by the mall between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 in the morning?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2542.463,2547.273,"I would assume, Justice Marshall, very few."
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2692.98,2695.51,Will you stop a minute so I can ask you a question?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2695.51,2696.118,Of course.
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2696.118,2696.962,Good.
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2711.814,2712.642,Absolutely not.
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2754.828,2763.934,What if the Government were to say that Lafayette Park is a very small place and as a result we're not going to allow any demonstrations.
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2781.647,2791.565,"I think there are areas of the park, for example the areas near the Washington Monument, the area surrounding the Lincoln Memorial, which have traditionally been recognized as places of serenity and contemplation."
1983.82-1998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2846.605,2855.165,"Well, is it really so unreasonable, though, to say that in a tiny fragile park like Lafayette Park that you can't camp out?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2860.849,2890.041,"--Were there a showing that the camping out, Justice O'Connor, that the sleeping in some way incrementally interfered with the park... you see, the problem is of course, on the facts of this case the act of sleep, the act of actually remaining there, which is quite important to the demonstrators as a communicative mechanism, the act of remaining there to sleep through the night in no way increases the intensity of the park use."
1983.82-1998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.427,2902.629,"Mr. Neuborne, I wonder if that's consistent with the record."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2937.818,2945.175,"--Well, first, Justice Stevens, we have agreed and I think the Government recognizes that there is complete agreement on the maximum number."
1983.82-1998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.33,2953.374,"I understand, but your own application says that the maximum number will never be there unless they can sleep."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,2983.081,3000.59,"I agree, Your Honor, Justice Stevens, that were the sleep here solely facilitative, were it simply a mechanism to make it easier to conduct the demonstration, while that is a non-constitutional factor that the Park Service might take into account, it is certainly not constitutionally obliged to do so."
1983.82-1998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.823,3009.211,"I realize it's not the basis on which you argue, but it's what you said in your application."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3009.211,3021.566,"But there is a linkage between that statement and the communicative elements as well, and that is a recognition... and this is a biological recognition... of what it means to be a homeless person and on the street all day."
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3150.138,3152.263,Did you present this argument to the Court of Appeals?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3152.263,3152.56,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3153.089,3154.964,Did any of the eleven judges agree with you?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3154.964,3155.839,"No, sir."
1983.82-1998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.49,3174.113,"Well, there's no question that what the people who drafted it interpret the regulation that way."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3174.113,3177.643,"Yes, but I think the traditional--"
1983.82-1998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.643,3181.564,And there's no mystery about what their interpretation is.
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3181.564,3184.015,"--No, they made it very clear."
1983.82-1998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.904,3192.12,And isn't the regulation subject to that construction?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3195.65,3205.256,"Well, I think where there are two plausible constructions, Justice White, of a regulation... and I think it is a plausible construction to suggest that it does not bar the activity at issue here."
1983.82-1998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.752,3220.673,--You mean override the view of the agency of its own regulation?
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3220.673,3226.826,--It wouldn't be the first time that this Court has done so to avoid the necessity of a constitutional adjudication.
1983.82-1998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.044,3234.526,"Before you do, let me ask you one other factual question."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3234.526,3234.917,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-1998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3234.917,3237.259,"As I understand it, there's no fires permitted."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3240.804,3244.131,"They don't keep warm, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1983.82-1998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.647,3245.709,Even if they come--
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3245.709,3251.816,"They wrap themselves, they wrap themselves in whatever, overcoats and bedding and--"
1983.82-1998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.816,3253.252,--But you don't have anything like electric heaters--
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3253.252,3253.596,"--Oh, no."
1983.82-1998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.174,3255.549,"--or anything like that, or blankets?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3255.549,3263.827,There is no amenity whatever contemplated in connection with this demonstration.
1983.82-1998,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3303.389,3309.995,"Why don't you take a picture of them sleeping on the gratings, which they do all over Washington?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3309.995,3310.558,"--Yes, sir, I know."
1983.82-1998,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3310.558,3313.635,"Well, why don't you take those and use those?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3315.648,3318.725,They would be and indeed are.
1983.82-1998,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3318.725,3320.132,"Well, why don't you?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3320.132,3322.209,"Well, there are pictures taken."
1983.82-1998,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3322.209,3324.583,"Well, where are they used?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3325.583,3327.675,That's one of the problems.
1983.82-1998,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3329.066,3338.953,"Well, I mean, how are you going to... I'll bet you more people pass by the Department of Justice building than pass by the Mall."
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3338.953,3341.171,"--Yes, sir, but I--"
1983.82-1998,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3341.171,3345.246,And they can see them sitting on the grating in front of the Department of Justice.
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3345.246,3346.34,--I think that's correct.
1983.82-1998,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3346.34,3349.636,"Well, why do they have to go over to the Mall to see them?"
1983.82-1998,1,17909,burt_neuborne,,3349.636,3352.807,"The problem, Justice Marshall, is that they don't appear to see them."
