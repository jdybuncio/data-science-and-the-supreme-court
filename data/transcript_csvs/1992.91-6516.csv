1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.687,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-6516, Edward Soldal v. Cook County, Illinois."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,11.249,29.881,This case involves the issue of whether the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the law abiding against unreasonable seizure of their home and effects by state officers.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,102.888,112.275,"You know just that the Fourth Amendment protects possessory rights in a piece of personal property just anywhere, do you?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,112.275,120.443,The Fourth Amendment would protect possessory rights in the type of property which is protected by the Fourth Amendment.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,122.653,129.707,Let's assume the officers enter an open field and run off with a mowing machine.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,132.08,137.053,I think if that is a seizure--
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,137.053,139.574,"Well, it's an effect, isn't it, and it's a seizure."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,139.574,145.987,"--If it is a seizure, if it is an effect, and if in fact that seizure is unreasonable, then it would apply."
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.223,200.324,"Well, there's no doubt that if you seize something incident to an invasion of privacy in the home or some other protected place like a car, why the Fourth Amendment does, is implicated."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,200.324,205.858,But the point of those places was that there was no invasion of privacy.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.038,230.665,"So a law enforcement officer walks up to a person on the street, grabs his briefcase out of his hand and walks off with it, and then gets a warrant to open it?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,230.665,232.447,Yes.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.447,238.111,And he had probable cause to have it opened.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,244.514,245.084,Yes.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,245.685,246.266,Even if it's never opened?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,246.266,258.595,Even if it is never opened because this Court has consistently held that the Fourth Amendment does protect possessory rights as well as in addition to privacy rights.
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.192,295.688,"But if that is so how do you explain that there hasn't been, that this is the first time that a case like this should have come up in a couple of hundred years?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,309.646,312.958,"I think that's not accurate, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.958,313.659,Okay.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,314.34,339.436,"Because the G.M. Leasing case, which was a seizure for tax purposes, in that case by IRS agents, did analyze the seizure itself, not any search but the seizure itself as a possible Fourth Amendment violation, held that it must satisfy the command of the Fourth Amendment that it be reasonable and held eventually that it was reasonable."
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.436,340.227,What was the date of that?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,340.227,343.349,The G.M. Leasing was--
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.349,346.311,1977.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,346.311,347.571,"--Okay, 1977."
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.571,349.374,So it's not 200 years.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,351.924,355.366,"Well, Judge, I don't think that's true too, either."
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.501,376.991,--I'm talking about sheriff seizures.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,383.906,385.005,"--Well, most--"
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.005,392.152,I assume that there's a state remedy and it seems to me the reason has probably been that there is a state remedy for those seizures.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,397.635,408.151,"--And for that reason I have not brought a procedural due process claim before this Court, and it is a Fourth Amendment claim that is before this Court and not a procedural due process claim."
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.151,411.373,"How do you, how does the Fourth Amendment apply to the states?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,411.373,413.336,Through the Fourteenth Amendment.
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.336,414.435,Which reads--
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,414.435,416.926,Which is due process.
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.926,419.961,"--no one shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,419.961,420.409,Correct.
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.409,420.969,Right.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,423.061,432.537,"In that sense, but this Court has always been clear that civil rights actions, there are basically three types."
1992.91-6516,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,444.746,446.168,"Which is what you're claiming here, isn't it?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,446.168,446.849,--Yes.
1992.91-6516,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,446.849,450.252,"I mean, you're bringing an incorporation argument, not a procedure argument."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,453.314,456.086,"That is correct, Justice Souter, yes."
1992.91-6516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,475.206,480.67,"Well, should we address that question here in answer to this case?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,480.67,491.169,"Justice O'Connor, I really think you have addressed it at great length in any number of cases, from Monroe against Pape to more recently Zinermon against Burch."
1992.91-6516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.169,500.325,"Well, the state in this instance does give your client a civil damages action for the trespass, I assume?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,500.325,500.996,That is correct.
1992.91-6516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,501.524,503.785,So you could have filed that claim.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,505.698,516.172,"I didn't because under Section 1983 the Congress has very clearly, in my view, given me a Federal remedy for this type of action."
1992.91-6516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.655,530.923,"Well, do you think that the action of the officers was basically random and unauthorized in the sense the court talked about in Parratt or Williamson County?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,530.923,535.336,In terms of it not being pursuant to an established state procedure?
1992.91-6516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,535.336,535.837,Right.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,535.837,536.747,Yes.
1992.91-6516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,539.418,545.124,So perhaps then that's all the process that is due.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,545.124,550.496,--If I were bringing a procedural due process claim that would be true.
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.496,555.239,But then you're making the law turn just on the technicality of pleading.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,566.877,585.52,"It doesn't at all, Justice Kennedy, and if you look at the cases that have construed Parratt, for instance if you look at Daniels against Williams, where the prisoner slipped and fell, that clearly would not, which was dismissed on Parratt grounds, that clearly would not be a Fourth Amendment case."
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,641.048,650.254,But I take it the procedural violation is necessarily hypothesized on some substantive constitutional violation having occurred.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,650.254,660.302,"Well, under a procedural due process claim you would obviously have to show some deprivation of life, liberty, or property."
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,742.295,745.538,"That's what Monroe v. Pape held, wasn't it?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,745.538,747.0,"Yes it was, Chief Justice."
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.0,752.473,"But that dealt with a statutory question basically, not a constitutional one."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,752.473,762.217,"Well, Monroe v. Pape was, my understanding of Monroe v. Pape was that it was they were alleging a Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violation."
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,762.217,762.828,Yes.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,780.31,784.514,"That is correct, Chief Justice."
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.157,798.611,"But 1983 doesn't create any substantive rights and so there was a Fourth Amendment, was that the basis there?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,798.611,804.165,"Monroe v. Pape I think alleged both Fourth and Fourteenth, although I'm not going to swear to that."
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.165,804.856,Yes.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,805.627,806.616,Yeah.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.189,817.756,"And of course if the Fourth, if the Fourth Amendment required first resort to state remedies there wouldn't be a 1983 action."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,817.756,832.165,"Well, that, for all practical effects that would be true because in a vast majority of situations where you have violations of civil rights that also does amount in some sense to a violation of state law."
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,862.493,867.549,"Yes, but the holding in Monroe against Pape was a statutory one."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,878.424,879.335,Okay.
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.335,887.21,"But 1983 did not, rather Monroe against Pape did not address the contours of the Fourth Amendment."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,887.21,892.823,"Yes, I understand the distinction that you're making there."
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.354,944.308,"Well, in Parratt, in that line of cases, and Hudson against Palmer, tend to cut against that argument, perhaps in a rather limited field."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,944.308,958.055,"--Well, they cut against that argument in a procedural due process case, there's no question about that, and set forth that in such a case post deprivation process may be all the process to which a person is due."
1992.91-6516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.055,961.939,But that just means there's no constitutional violation.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,969.162,969.763,That's correct.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.907,1000.595,"Are you just, are you basing your primary argument on the fact that this was a seizure of property which would qualify as an effect or as of a house?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1002.735,1003.456,No.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.367,1010.88,"Well, I know, but house and effects, they're all property."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1012.423,1013.441,--That's correct.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.441,1016.024,Are you indicating there was any invasion of privacy in this case?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1016.024,1016.634,Yes.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.009,1025.531,"Well, they got thrown out of their house, didn't they?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1025.531,1026.161,That's right.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.582,1036.019,"Isn't that a fairly egregious invasion of privacy, to get thrown out of your own house?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1036.019,1038.959,"--It always seemed to me, Justice White, that it was."
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.959,1045.574,"So you don't need to really rely on just the fact that this was a seizure of a piece of property, do you?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1045.574,1051.806,I don't need to rely on that but I think I have an extremely strong case based upon that also.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.806,1052.397,Is that your strongest?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1052.397,1053.899,I would say they're both extremely strong.
1992.91-6516,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.929,1072.181,And what did the Seventh Circuit say about that aspect of the case?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1072.181,1083.389,"--It said there was not an invasion of privacy here, that this type of activity did not invade the privacy because it didn't invade my clients' secrecy."
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.595,1113.039,When somebody stops me from doing a lawful activity do I say you're invading my privacy?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1113.039,1115.29,--In certain situations--
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.29,1121.884,"I mean, I don't know what that, that doesn't mean anything to me unless by privacy you mean the right to be let alone, I suppose, and then everything invades the right of privacy."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1121.884,1138.486,"--And this Court has analyzed and defined the right of privacy in much narrower terms than that, notably in United States against Place where it held that the detention of baggage for 90 minutes was an invasion of privacy of the defendant in that case."
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.816,1171.12,"The words of the First Amendment don't say anything about invasion of privacy, do they?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1173.081,1174.543,--And they also say secure.
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.135,1212.798,It doesn't say secure from everything.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1217.059,1217.639,That's correct.
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.639,1219.102,"And you say this is a seizure, which makes sense to me."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1219.102,1220.362,Okay.
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1309.133,1313.225,Do you agree with the Seventh Circuit's analysis on the takings issue?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1314.965,1321.67,I don't think it was a taking because it... and certainly I didn't plead that in the complaint.
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1322.932,1328.127,Your pleading was confined to the Fourth Amendment aspect of the case?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1328.127,1329.687,"No, my pleading, my original--"
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1329.687,1333.2,"You pled a conspiracy to deprive of property, didn't you?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1333.2,1335.25,"--I'm sorry, I couldn't hear."
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1335.25,1338.233,"You pled a conspiracy to deprive of property, didn't you?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1338.233,1341.836,"Well, no, I don't think in so many words."
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1361.828,1367.472,Would a taking in violation of the takings clause be a substantive due process violation under the Fourteenth Amendment?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1367.472,1376.728,"--Judge, I really don't... Justice, I really don't feel equipped to answer that question."
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1408.35,1414.913,"If the Government demolishes a house and puts a public school on it, but without compensating, is that a seizure?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1414.913,1417.236,Is that a seizure?
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.416,1437.158,And under the takings clause your remedy is an action for inverse condemnation usually.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1450.539,1460.714,"If there were a, what could be construed as a seizure, and if that seizure was unreasonable, yes, I think it could be."
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.714,1476.816,Well then you really are broadening the Fourth Amendment considerably because there's a whole class of cases where some agent of the Government goes out and purports to take or occupy private property that really he wasn't authorized to do.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1488.132,1501.832,"Yeah, well, I think you would need to look at whether the taking itself was, came within the definition of a seizure, and then look at whether the seizure was unreasonable."
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.832,1504.765,I don't know why you would have to proceed in that order.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1525.368,1529.48,"Well, this is not a taking for a governmental purpose."
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1565.924,1571.237,We take this case on the hypothesis that the sheriff stands in the shoes of the trailer park owner.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1571.237,1572.368,"Correct, Judge."
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1574.569,1585.448,If this had been a state run trailer park and the sheriff had wrongfully evicted and removed the trailer pad wouldn't you say that that was a taking?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1585.448,1588.839,If it... no.
1992.91-6516,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.92,1607.611,But why?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1621.99,1631.958,"Certainly one thing to look at would be whether the taking was for the, for a governmental purpose."
1992.91-6516,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1640.262,1646.317,When the Government takes evidence it is taking it for its own purpose.
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1651.059,1653.64,"Yes, more the latter."
1992.91-6516,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1653.64,1655.743,"Well, what do you do then in this case?"
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1665.341,1690.446,"Well, it does fit within the line of cases that say that the non-criminal context of a seizure is irrelevant to whether the Fourth Amendment applies, and also the fact, as this Court held in O'Connor against Ortega, the non-investigatory context of the seizure is irrelevant in terms of the application of the Fourth Amendment."
1992.91-6516,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1690.446,1713.49,"Well, I'll grant you that, which gets you to the point in effect of demonstrating that there is nothing in the purpose, in the civil nature of this that precludes a Fourth Amendment application, but it doesn't get to the point of saying how do we distinguish between a case appropriately brought under the Fourth Amendment and one that should be brought under the Fifth for compensation."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1713.49,1731.913,"Yeah, then I am left with the distinction that I drew initially there, that if it was for the Government to actually do something with the trailer or in some way convert it into something for their own use, then it would appear that the takings clause would be more appropriate."
1992.91-6516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.913,1732.894,But why does it have to--
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1736.956,1737.687,Correct.
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.818,1741.019,Why does it have to fall into one or the other?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1741.019,1742.879,Why couldn't it fall into both?
1992.91-6516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.879,1744.361,You concede that it cannot fall into both?
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1744.361,1745.752,"No, I don't concede that at all."
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.069,1772.018,"Yes, Mr. Stainthorp."
1992.91-6516,0,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,1772.018,1772.659,Thank you.
1992.91-6516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.659,1774.061,"Mr. Gillis, we'll hear from you."
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1774.061,1778.873,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-6516,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.268,1801.621,xxx thought there was plenty of state action?
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1801.621,1806.085,"--They advanced a number, I think two or three positions."
1992.91-6516,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.829,1817.942,Well anyway they didn't decide the case on the basis that there was not state action?
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1817.942,1818.563,--That's right.
1992.91-6516,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1847.472,1849.933,How about its protection of property?
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1849.933,1852.745,--The Fourth Amendment's protection of property?
1992.91-6516,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1852.745,1853.886,Yes.
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1853.886,1858.399,We do not think the Fourth Amendment protects basic property interests.
1992.91-6516,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1866.393,1872.306,So that seizure basically is a dead letter unless it's accompanied by a privacy violation on your view?
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1872.306,1873.688,Yes.
1992.91-6516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.688,1890.879,"To me it's one thing to say that, as we have in Katz and later cases, that a violation of privacy constitutes a search and a seizure, or a seizure, even if there isn't any physical violation of property rights."
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1905.299,1921.119,"I admit that to put any type of ceiling on that conduct would be risky, but on the facts we have here where there is no prying or snooping, invading or inspecting, we think the Fourth Amendment is not involved."
1992.91-6516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.002,1940.293,"Well, what about the classic English case challenging general warrants, which is what this provision of our Constitution was all about, was a case alleging trespass, a violation of property interests."
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1946.387,1953.5,"--I think it was trespass to gain information that should be kept private, that persons have a right to keep private."
1992.91-6516,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1956.051,1960.716,"Yes, but that was no part of the old trespass action, was it?"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1960.716,1962.326,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-6516,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1962.326,1978.307,"That was no... I mean the intention to gain information was not part of the cause of action in Entick and Carrington, and there's no indication that that was, that that policy was somehow narrowed when the Fourth Amendment got adopted, was there?"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,1978.307,1984.571,I think you have to look at the objective acts of the police officers or sheriffs.
1992.91-6516,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.701,2026.9,"Mr. Gillis, could I give you an... we had an argument this morning arising out of a drug seizure in that the law enforcement agency took possession of a home that had been purchased with the proceeds of, allegedly, of drug transactions."
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2047.913,2053.337,--I think that could be a Fourth Amendment seizure if the Government is following through on some interest.
1992.91-6516,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.29,2062.013,"Even though there is no criminal proceeding, just that it's the proceeds of criminal conduct?"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2062.013,2066.458,"I think that it, the Fourth Amendment should not be limited to the strict--"
1992.91-6516,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.458,2068.777,"To evidentiary searches, right?"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2068.777,2069.359,--Right.
1992.91-6516,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.952,2086.438,"So if this precise seizure we have in this case, to use the colloquial term rather than the constitutional term, had been for the purpose of forfeiting the trailer you would agree that would have been a seizure?"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2086.438,2089.491,"Yes, or any typical police activity."
1992.91-6516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.491,2104.422,"So taking the trailer for the Government to keep does constitute a Fourth Amendment violation, but taking the trailer in order to give it back to the, well, they're taking it to get it off of the property--"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2104.422,2119.421,We think this is like the Cardwell case where the police car was parked on the public lot and then the police officers took paint scrapings from it and used those.
1992.91-6516,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.957,2146.61,"--They didn't succeed in carrying it off either, did they?"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2146.61,2156.036,"No, they... it was moved temporarily and given back to the petitioners in this case."
1992.91-6516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.036,2157.215,"Well, how was it moved?"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2161.189,2170.896,"The trailer park people put a hook on it with a tractor, moved it off on its wheels to a nearby lot where it was kept safe."
1992.91-6516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.896,2180.811,"Isn't the theory of this case and wasn't the theory of the judgment below that it was in the possession of the police officers, that they took possession of it and moved it out of there?"
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2180.811,2189.717,"If you adopt the theory of the Seventh Circuit it was temporarily in their possession, but turned over again to the plaintiffs, unlike--"
1992.91-6516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.717,2192.899,"I understand, but it seems to me that's at least a temporary seize."
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2195.39,2200.836,"--I think you could, using the common meaning of words it was a temporary seizure."
1992.91-6516,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.784,2289.351,"In Texas against Brown Justice Stevens said that the Fourth Amendment protects two interests of the citizen, the interest in retaining possession of property and the interest in maintaining personal privacy."
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2290.372,2292.365,I think we do.
1992.91-6516,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.865,2294.967,"You have to, I suppose."
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2294.967,2295.626,--Yes.
1992.91-6516,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.763,2307.153,Thank you... excuse me.
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2312.549,2322.934,"Horton against California was the search where they were, the search warrant said rings and they also took guns."
1992.91-6516,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.934,2332.09,"Well, the court said the right to security and person and property protected by the Fourth Amendment may be invaded in quite different ways by searches and seizures."
1992.91-6516,1,33837,kenneth_l_gillis,,2332.09,2333.462,"Yes, we agree with that."
1992.91-6516,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.061,2351.803,"Thank you, Mr. Gillis."
1992.91-6516,2,33172,john_l_stainthorp,,2354.417,2356.446,"Thank you, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
