1996.95-1181,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.676,"We'll hear argument now in No. 95-1181, William C. Dunn and Delta Consultants, Inc. v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,8.708,13.102,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,50.635,58.6,"Now, if it were a... an off-exchange futures deal--"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,58.6,59.822,--I'm sorry?
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,59.822,63.535,--If it were an off-exchange futures--
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,63.535,64.694,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.694,75.841,"--agreement that we were dealing with, I guess the Commodity Futures Trading Commission... both parties agree, it wouldn't have jurisdiction?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,75.841,78.913,"I believe... yes, both parties would agree, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,84.187,88.259,Why shouldn't futures and options be treated the same?
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,88.259,97.426,"--I believe they should be, Your Honor, and I believe both of them are exempt by the Treasury Amendment, as long as they're off-exchange transactions in foreign currency, whether in futures or in options."
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,97.426,103.33,Although the Treasury Amendment didn't really speak of the options.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,103.33,104.061,No.
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.043,132.929,But there are some holdings that distinguish transactions in from a future or an option agreement.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,132.929,151.221,"I would think the holdings Your Honor is referring to are certain holdings that have distinguished off-exchange futures from off-exchange options, along the lines that an option until exercised does not become a transaction in the foreign currency itself."
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.155,172.706,Exchange traded futures or exchange traded options?
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,172.706,185.313,"In the two cases I believe Justice O'Connor is referring to... is the Chicago Board of Trade and the American Board of Trade case... they both dealt with off-exchange options on foreign currencies, and--"
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,185.313,186.365,She said futures I think.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,186.365,187.787,--Thank you.
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.167,198.344,But you... would you run by me what you said about dictum because the Second Circuit said we might have gone on another ground but we didn't.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,202.146,212.624,"As I said, Your Honor, I believe that the holding in the American Board of Trade case on which the court below relied in this case was dicta because it was on-exchange trading."
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,213.372,219.197,"--But in that earlier case, the court didn't decide it on the basis that it was on-exchange trading."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,225.37,225.61,--No.
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,235.618,236.029,Is their holding.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,236.029,240.901,--The holding in American Board of Trade was options do not become transactions in foreign currency--
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.901,241.092,Right.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,241.092,242.023,--until they're exercised.
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,242.023,242.404,Right.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,242.404,247.336,The court below recognized that they could have gone on a different basis--
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.336,247.656,But didn't.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,247.656,258.723,"--but did not, and accordingly could not overrule the decision of the prior panel and noted the conflict with the Fourth Circuit and indicated that that... such a conflict was for this Court to resolve."
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,258.723,261.055,Yes.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,264.629,271.102,"Oh, I... my only point, Your Honor, was I said I thought it could have been dicta, but clearly that is not the way the court, the Second Circuit, went."
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.102,272.223,Right.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,272.223,287.283,"The question, thus, is whether the off-exchange foreign currency options are transactions in foreign currency within the Treasury Amendment and thus exempt from regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act."
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,334.875,337.005,"Well, you say whatever type."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,339.216,340.177,"That's true, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,345.05,353.138,Tell me who were the traders that the Treasury had in mind when it proposed this amendment.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,355.668,359.89,The majority... the off-exchange interbank market is primarily composed of the major banks.
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.89,360.251,All right.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,360.251,363.322,And in fact the trading in this case was done in such banks.
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,363.322,366.784,"Now, are the major... that's in part an answer to my next question."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,377.3,381.425,"I'm only unclear, Your Honor, if you're asking back in 1974 or--"
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,381.425,381.685,No.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,388.269,389.109,--They're trading--
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,389.109,391.462,As they're now--
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,391.462,393.133,"--They are trading foreign currency options now, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.667,424.652,"--So that if the concern at the time the amendment was originally proposed was to keep this business within the United States, or keeps the... keep the American banks competitive, that concern of policy I presume then would be just as applicable to options trading today as it was for future tradings then."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,424.652,426.255,"--I think that's precisely correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,451.829,461.186,"If... as I understood your answer to Justice Souter, there were very few traders other than the large banks in options in foreign currency."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,463.828,467.151,"Again, Your Honor, are we speaking then or now?"
1996.95-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,467.151,467.661,Then.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,467.661,478.337,I don't know what traders existed back in '74 in the Government securities market.
1996.95-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,504.524,514.751,One of the concerns that I have is that whatever we say here with reference to foreign securities... options in foreign currencies is going to apply also to options in Government securities.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,527.388,528.89,"--All right, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.234,691.639,Why couldn't in have a narrower meaning given that the statute also uses the word involving?
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,702.756,708.89,Because there is no indication of any congressional purpose to indicate such a distinction.
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,739.09,744.013,Is there some reason in policy why you would want to distinguish between the two?
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,744.013,747.956,There is no reason why I would wish to distinguish between the two.
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.956,751.129,Why one would wish to distinguish between the two then.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,751.129,761.925,I don't think that there would be a reason in light of the legislative intent indicated in enacting the statute.
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,870.215,878.521,"Because we're going to have to draw the distinction with respect to the sort of recapture proviso at the end, aren't we, because that refers to sales for future delivery?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,883.495,888.819,"I do not agree, Your Honor, that the savings clause only relates to futures."
1996.95-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,906.76,913.954,"But sale for future delivery is a fairly straightforward description, isn't it, of the future versus the options contract?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,913.954,920.678,"I would say, Your Honor, that the description of sale for future delivery would include both futures and options."
1996.95-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.816,937.698,"If you were describing an option alone, would you use the word delivery?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,946.945,952.729,"--Well, I think you deliver under an option as much as you deliver under a future because--"
1996.95-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.729,961.345,"But you don't deliver until you... until somebody exercises the option; whereas, under the futures contract, if the contract is not canceled, you do have to deliver."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,961.856,976.223,"--Oh, that's true, but my point is first that most futures contracts are offset rather than actual delivery being made under them, and the nature of the transaction is both futures and options are derivative transactions."
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.11,996.717,"Well, whether actually delivered or not, whether they're offset instead of executed, doesn't alter whether they are a sale for future delivery."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1000.06,1003.803,--And I believe that is true for both options and futures.
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1003.803,1005.596,An option is not a sale at all.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1014.041,1017.944,"From the writer's standpoint, Your Honor, there's an obligation."
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1042.667,1081.113,"Mr. Stumpp, I thought section... 7 U.S. Code, section 6(c) had some specific bearing on this case, and it's entitled Regulated Option Trading and says that no person shall offer to enter into or enter the execution of any transaction involving any commodity regulated under this chapter which is of the character of or is commonly known to the trade as an option contrary to any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1104.7,1106.633,"On 6c(f), that's exactly the purpose, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1106.633,1125.693,"Yes, but on the first... on subparagraph (b) it seems to give to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the power to regulate or prohibit some transaction in the character of an option."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1125.693,1126.274,That's true.
1996.95-1181,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1208.538,1222.827,"But to reach your conclusion, you have to say, as you do apparently, that an option with respect to foreign currency is a transaction in foreign currency."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1226.5,1231.003,"--An option is as much a transaction in foreign currency as a future is, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.003,1239.288,"Would you look at, let's see, section 6(c)."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1245.911,1248.865,"Brief on the merits, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1248.865,1262.785,"--Brief on the merits, and it's item 2 on page 6a which is section 6c(d)(2)."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1308.582,1312.585,"Well, first, Your Honor, I don't agree with that kind of a conclusion."
1996.95-1181,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1473.202,1475.984,"Why couldn't you deliver Eurodollars, Mr. Stumpp?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1475.984,1478.325,They don't exist as such.
1996.95-1181,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.325,1480.228,That's a good reason.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1526.256,1541.917,"Speaking here, Your Honor, I don't think there is any regulatory gap because even the CFTC's complaint describes the investments that were entered into here as investment strategies, and I think that would fall within the definition of investment contracts for SEC jurisdictional purposes."
1996.95-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1574.648,1618.767,"If we think that the language is open to either interpretation, and at the time they enacted it, nobody really thought about the options market developing, and if there's a good practical way to get your... the industry's concerns dealt with through negotiations between Treasury and CFTC dividing responsibility, why wouldn't we then, other things being equal, say, all right, the people who administer this, apparently the Treasury and the CFTC, think it's better to read the language as inclusive and then get the exclusion through negotiation with the industry between the agencies?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1629.436,1641.594,"First, Your Honor, I'd note that it might not have been intended that way, but I think your question has a hypothetical element to it simply because the CFTC and the Treasury Department most certainly do not agree over the way this provision is read."
1996.95-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1642.794,1645.715,But I was thinking they could work out... they don't agree.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1645.715,1647.067,--They don't agree.
1996.95-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.824,1673.214,Right.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1673.214,1673.795,Obviously--
1996.95-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1673.795,1687.662,"I noted that that brief was filed for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and for the United States as amicus curiae, whereas the opposition on the merits is just for the CFTC."
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1687.662,1688.193,--That's right.
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.047,1694.688,"And this thing was called the Treasury Amendment, wasn't it?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1694.688,1695.427,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.427,1697.46,Because it was introduced by the Treasury Department.
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1697.46,1701.441,Specifically by... or specifically enacted as they proposed it.
1996.95-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.441,1729.23,"But if I may just vary Justice Breyer's question, yes, these agencies right now do not seem to be in agreement, but if this Court made a decision that would say what the law is, then does it follow that there are going to be this tight regulation then that would drive everyone to the London or other markets instead of reasonable exemptions being made?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1729.23,1734.893,"I think that that's... obviously, it's a hypothetical because it hasn't happened, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.178,1749.704,"Well, isn't your answer that if Treasury were that confident, they would never have introduced the Treasury Amendment?"
1996.95-1181,0,26119,gary_d_stumpp,,1764.223,1768.677,I will agree with that observation.
1996.95-1181,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.131,1777.633,"Very well, Mr. Stumpp."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1779.844,1787.507,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1798.176,1804.38,"Well, so you both agree that it's a... an option is a transaction in."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1804.38,1804.851,No.
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1806.281,1807.653,Then I misunderstood you.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1807.653,1808.161,--Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1830.197,1833.499,Is it a transaction involving a commodity?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1833.499,1837.881,It would be fair to characterize it as a transaction involving a commodity.
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.691,1853.862,"May I clarify one thing at the outset, Mr. Minear?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1859.626,1860.478,--That's correct.
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.478,1870.081,And the Chicago Board of Trade has filed a brief in which they express concern about the status of off-exchange transactions in Federal securities.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1880.479,1883.291,"To a large extent, that is true, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.686,1891.586,"Correct, but they're concerned about the off-exchange transactions."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1891.586,1892.257,Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.083,1907.257,"And your position is that the trading in options will... would be regulated, but trading in futures would not."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1907.257,1909.047,That is true.
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.047,1909.478,Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1909.478,1918.975,"I think it's also important to point out, however, that it's not clear if there is actually a market off... over the counter in Government security options."
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.27,1940.119,"But the irony then is you would retain the power to regulate the less... I mean, the market that may not exist, namely, the options, and you would have no power to regulate the market we know exists in futures."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1940.119,1942.881,"--Well, that simply reflects what happened in 1974."
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1988.549,1993.744,"Well, it could exempt... but it could not regulate the futures, the off-exchange trading in futures."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1993.744,1994.453,It could not.
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.453,1994.934,Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1994.934,1995.595,That is correct.
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1995.595,2007.703,"Now, what regulations has the CFTC imposed on the market in foreign currency options?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2007.703,2017.94,Generally foreign currency options would be subject to the usual requirements of a contract market and the usual requirements that govern options trading.
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2024.713,2026.166,They just prohibit it.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2026.166,2029.167,"They have largely prohibited it with certain very important exceptions, however."
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.606,2064.25,Could it be said that the trade here was under one of the exceptions?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2065.051,2067.121,"No, I do not believe that they would qualify for any of the exceptions here."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.678,2088.016,I think Congress was also concerned that the Treasury Department ought to have control over matters that involve trading in foreign currency which probably affect our own currency as well.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2091.967,2092.667,--That is correct.
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.667,2096.239,It can do what it wants and the President cannot alter its decision.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2096.239,2097.341,That is largely true.
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.341,2112.76,"I think Congress was concerned that these decisions should lie with the President of the United States through the Treasury Department, and I don't see, as far as the impact of that upon our national life is concerned, how options are any different from futures."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2122.197,2127.821,"Well, it's not clear, Your Honor, first of all, in the record what effects this will have on the foreign currency markets."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.586,2159.911,"Well, I certainly don't think that just the use of the word in... it bears the meaning you want to give it, but if that same terminology had been used in some legislation, I can just envision the Government coming up here and saying... let's say, an SEC authorization says that it can regulate transactions in something, and you would say, well, it's ridiculous to think that you can avoid all of this by simply dealing in options."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2169.138,2177.154,"We think what... we think... Congress had in its mind was the problem of futures trading and not options trading, and we think the language it used actually indicates that."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.175,2194.876,--Where are those in your brief?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2194.876,2196.186,"--Yes, those are in our brief."
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2209.165,2212.597,There's no sound coming out of your speaker.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2215.319,2216.868,--I'm not sure if there is a problem.
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2216.868,2218.849,It's not connected.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2218.849,2221.272,I will try and speak more loudly if that would be of assistance.
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2221.272,2222.462,I think you'll have to because it isn't working.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2225.985,2229.547,I would much prefer to speak to the important matters here.
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2271.546,2274.037,To go back to Justice Scalia's question for a minute--
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2274.037,2274.598,Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.598,2308.118,"--I'm... it may well be that the language determines this in your favor, but if it does not and if it really is open and if Congress did in fact regulate... exempt the foreign transactions for the reasons set out in the Treasury letter, then is there any reason why, in a world where options transactions now serve the same purposes and are used to the same extent as futures transactions, the result should differ?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2308.118,2308.969,Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.969,2317.345,I mean if the language is open and the world is such that the purpose is the same and the Treasury Department apparently thinks that's what it meant.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2317.345,2320.567,"Yes, we think there is a very good reason--"
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2320.567,2321.148,What is that?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2321.148,2328.251,"--that they shculd be treated differently, and that is Congress' historic concern that options posed a more serious risk of fraud than futures."
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.251,2344.713,"If that isn't so, that is to say, if in today's world it's just as easy to be fraudulent or not fraudulent in respect to a futures transaction when engaged in by thousands of people as a options transaction, then what do we do?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2344.713,2345.254,"Well, I think--"
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2345.254,2348.826,"I mean, is it like the Commerce Clause not foreseeing the automobile?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2348.826,2367.427,"--I think it's a matter of the Court looking to the expertise of two bodies: first, Congress which has continued to regulate options more strictly and has vested authority for exceptions with the CFTC; and then the CFTC itself and its assessment of whether these markets do pose a serious risk or not."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.878,2389.823,"But if they trusted the FTC to make these determinations, they wouldn't have needed the Treasury Amendment."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2401.802,2422.084,"I think what Congress was doing in 1974, it was looking at the markets that existed at that time, and it was saying, yes, we feel we can safely exempt the foreign currency futures market, the only market that existed and the only market that was described in the Treasury Amendment's... the Treasury Department's correspondence respecting the Treasury Amendment."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2429.768,2436.604,"Well, no, but the legislative findings deal with... in section 5 deal with both futures and options."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2436.604,2446.859,"--Yes, that is true, and again I think section 5 is probably most notable for the fact that it distinguishes between transactions in commodities and options."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.859,2452.522,I thought you were saying that Congress really wasn't thinking about options at all when it passed this bill.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2452.522,2455.315,"It was not to a large extent, and with regard to section 5--"
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.315,2457.905,"Well, then why did it include options in the legislative findings?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2457.905,2463.54,--The legislative findings... you're talking about the last two sentences of that section which appear on page 3a.
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.54,2465.912,"Well, I presume those are as good as any other findings."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2465.912,2471.415,"But those findings were added in 1983, some time after 1974."
1996.95-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.489,2505.757,"With respect to this very case, Mr. Minear, the point that was made I think in the Chase Manhattan brief about the SEC has ample jurisdiction to take care of this kind of operation."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2505.757,2508.618,"--That is not necessarily true, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.859,2564.886,"Isn't it true also, or is it... it's something I picked up from one of the briefs... that as the traders become more and more sophisticated, it's harder to tell a difference in a futures and an option, and you can even have an option on a future, et cetera, et cetera?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2569.431,2570.71,--It could be.
1996.95-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2594.476,2604.373,"But if they are so close that you can't tell them apart, what sense would it make to say that the futures are out but the options are in?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2604.373,2612.728,"--Well, we think that what Congress did in 1974 is it looked at the futures market as it existed then and said those... that area is exempt."
1996.95-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2634.312,2639.625,"Mr. Minear, don't futures and options involve the same market participants?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2653.664,2662.76,"Well, I think all of these can raise very complex economic questions in terms of the relationship between the options market and the futures market."
1996.95-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2683.243,2688.296,"Well, then maybe you need to adopt the Board of Trade's position that they're both subject to the act."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2688.296,2689.038,No.
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.959,2712.412,Could you refer me to something just in respect to your answer to Justice Kennedy?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2744.104,2752.829,"Yes, we are saying that there would be... if you hold that options are excluded, there will be a significant portion of the market that will not be subject to regulation by anyone."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.529,2783.018,Who monitors futures contracts for fraud?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2783.018,2788.561,"--No one is monitoring the futures contracts for fraud, and in part that was because--"
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.561,2788.901,"So, it works there."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2789.842,2792.194,"--The... and again, we're talking--"
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.194,2793.136,Is there some rule that everybody has to be regulated or--
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2793.136,2805.674,"--Let me clarify this again that with regard to the over-the-counter market, there is no CFTC direct regulation of futures, but that was based on the Congress... congressional determination that that was not necessary."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.955,2807.826,--That's begging the question.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2824.795,2825.316,--That's correct.
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.316,2828.639,But they also use the term on to refer to options.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2831.851,2832.973,I think the context--
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.973,2835.053,"They use in, they use on, they use involving."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2835.053,2854.195,"--I think you will find that they refer to transactions in options in only one case and that's in section 6c(f) where they say, transactions... where they actually refer to that the CFTC would have no jurisdiction over transactions in options on foreign currency traded on a national securities exchange."
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.19,2882.174,But the problem with that argument is the unless such transactions involve at the end of the subsection.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2885.307,2885.827,That's right.
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.729,2891.34,Not if involve is the broader term.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2891.34,2900.916,"Our view is this, that the transactions in foreign currency would include spot transactions, would include cash forward transactions, and would include futures transactions."
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2919.858,2946.074,"But, Mr. Minear, now do you agree that if the petitioners had engaged in exactly the same scheme, including misrepresentations and all, with their customers in trading in off-exchange foreign currency futures, the CFTC would have no jurisdiction over it?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2946.074,2947.376,We think that would--
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2947.376,2949.287,Same conduct exactly--
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2949.287,2950.289,--There would be one--
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2950.289,2951.859,--but in connection with futures.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2951.859,2952.57,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2958.253,2958.453,No.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2959.484,2961.406,"--Well, board of trade is not necessarily--"
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2961.406,2962.277,"They're off, not a board of trade."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2962.277,2965.048,--with your hypothetical assuming it's not on a board of trade.
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2965.048,2965.239,Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2965.239,2974.515,"In that situation it's true that the CFTC would not be able to bring an enforcement action, but it might be far more difficult to bring that type of fraudulent scheme and let me explain why."
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2984.931,2986.042,An option can?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2986.042,2996.518,"--An option can because what you're telling the person is, here, you pay this premium, a small premium, and you... and the sky is the limit on what you might get in the form of your investment return."
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3015.092,3022.766,Wouldn't there be even less reason to find an exception for an option where the buyer doesn't have to go ahead with it?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3024.977,3026.528,The difficulty here--
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3026.528,3029.129,"I mean, it's just a strange argument it seems to me."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3029.129,3034.142,"--Well, I think that this... the answer here is largely a part of history and largely a part of market psychology."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.116,3040.997,"Well, how do you know that?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3040.997,3049.312,"I think Congress made that determination in terms of how it decided in 1922, since 1922, that there would be no options."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.031,3063.121,And so all that proves is what you're saying was true in 1922.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3064.824,3072.157,"And what it proves is that in 1974, the relevant time for determining the Treasury Amendment, Congress continued to hold that view."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3072.157,3078.31,"Well, if we adopt your view of the Treasury Amendment, not if we adopt the petitioners'."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3078.31,3086.698,"Well, even apart from the Treasury Amendment, Congress continued to impose a ban on options in 1974 even though it was allowing trading in the futures market."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.479,3093.023,"Mr. Minear, has anybody... who's representing the President's position in this case?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3095.594,3096.746,"--Yes, that's right."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.165,3126.956,Thank you.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3126.956,3134.229,Now I'd like to point to some other textual indicia because I think we haven't really spent much time talking about those.
1996.95-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3172.654,3178.779,Does the word transactions in modify just foreign currency?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3178.779,3179.04,--No.
1996.95-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3183.283,3185.504,"So, then you do have transactions in an option."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3185.504,3190.686,"Yes, in repurchase options which in that case were specialized... is a specialized type of option."
1996.95-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3193.538,3195.56,That means you can have a transaction in an option.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3195.56,3205.436,"--You can have a transaction in an option, and we... our view would be different if Congress had said transactions in foreign currency options, but it simply said transactions in foreign currency."
1996.95-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3220.298,3221.358,I guess there's no such thing--
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3221.358,3222.38,--even though it included other kinds of options.
1996.95-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3222.38,3225.852,--There's no such thing as a repurchase future I suppose.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3225.852,3230.283,"I think not, and in fact I think that is true."
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.283,3232.865,Would you help me out with the term repurchase options?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3235.436,3239.479,"This is actually an area where there's some uncertainty, but let me explain."
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.363,3245.614,But we don't know what repurchase options are.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3245.614,3252.807,"--We think options are options on repurchase agreements, and we think that Congress might have been looking forward to the possibility of options on repurchase agreements."
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.071,3261.713,"And the universe that repurchase agreements covers, is that all agricultural commodities?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3261.713,3262.224,No.
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3285.558,3286.319,Help me again.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3291.993,3294.765,"--Yes, although this more often takes place between banks."
1996.95-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.499,3298.689,I see.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3298.689,3302.552,"But these are all Government securities, so they fall within the Government security exemption anyway."
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.552,3327.417,"Mr. Minear, if we should disagree with you and hold that options are included within the exemption, do you think the language at the end of that Treasury Amendment, unless such transactions involve the sale thereof for future delivery conducted on a board of trade... do you think that that is... can be applied to options?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3327.417,3329.998,We think it cannot be applied to options.
1996.95-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.309,3334.161,You're going to be in big trouble if we disagree with you then.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3334.161,3335.153,"--Yes, I think that's right."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3370.255,3374.828,"Mr. Minear, you said some part of that legislative finding was added in 1983?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3374.828,3375.108,--Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3375.108,3378.921,What was added and what was put in in 1974?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3378.921,3383.884,The 1974 language actually I think can be traced back to 1922.
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.595,3390.649,But what was added in 1983 that wasn't there... but was there in 1974?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3390.649,3398.062,"--The language respecting options which appears on page 3a of our appendix, and it begins at about halfway below the page."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3398.062,3398.703,Furthermore?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3398.703,3403.057,"Furthermore, transactions which are of the character of and are commonly known to the trade as options."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.43,3410.461,And that was added in 1983.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3410.461,3411.403,That was added in 1983.
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3516.319,3520.042,"But that would be a matter of the agency's jurisdiction, wouldn't it?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3522.604,3524.156,I think that you do in fact.
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3540.156,3540.947,"Yes, but that isn't a rule in thin air."
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3544.6,3545.499,Yes.
1996.95-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3545.499,3553.763,"And if anything here where it's the Treasury Amendment, why wouldn't you think Congress would like the courts to pay particular attention to the Treasury, if anyone?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3553.763,3563.55,"Well, we think that the Court's explanation of deference in Smiley is that Congress has delegated this authority to the agency that's charged with administration of the statute."
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3563.55,3578.571,"But on this point, hasn't the Government taken different positions at times and said that both futures and options in foreign currency were excluded from CFTC jurisdiction?"
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3582.053,3583.283,The United States filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit--
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3583.283,3584.084,Exactly.
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3584.084,3584.594,--taking that position.
1996.95-1181,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3584.594,3588.128,And so why is any deference owed here?
1996.95-1181,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3592.199,3595.751,"Well, the CFTC's position is not a litigation position."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3605.648,3606.449,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1996.95-1181,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3658.384,3659.385,"Thank you, Mr. Stumpp."
