1964.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.586,603.113,But not before the jury.
1964.53,0,15587,allen_bpierson_jr,,603.113,608.158,The Court would not allow him to testify before the jury on that limited point.
1964.53,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.158,614.691,But there was no conflict between the two -- the testimony of the defendant and the deputy before the jury.

1964.53,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,824.989,827.325,He was -- he was cross examined.
1964.53,0,15587,allen_bpierson_jr,,827.325,837.108,"The procedure in Louisiana as I understand it is that out of the presence of the jury, the judge will hear the testimony bearing on whether or not the confession was voluntary."
1964.53,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,845.929,856.335,But we -- Yes but the defense did question the accuracy of the testimony of the principal witness that is the chief deputy.

1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,2665.273,2674.226,Of course you do understand that our officers have no control over the matter in which the sheriff handles the -- his portion of the trial.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2674.226,2675.389,"No, it is a matter of fact."
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,2680.932,2690.271,"Now, at this time, I'd like to take up the question of the so-called confession or statements."
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2836.844,2842.066,How about when the counsel said that he hadn't had any sleep according to his contention.

1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,2846.379,2851.913,"Now that wasn't -- that wasn't because he was on bread and water, it was because he just didn't eat."
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2854.631,2854.843,What is that?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,2854.843,2861.218,Or if he had when the court questioned him there without having the prosecution able to get hold of him at that time.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2862.461,2873.668,"Well, what was his testimony that he wasn't furnished food for 48 hours or that he didn't want to eat for 48 hours?"
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,2873.668,2876.988,Approximately how long had it been since you had slept.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2947.284,2952.536,That the entire testimony of both of these deputy sheriffs in its printed record?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,2952.536,2958.784,"Not in their testimony, no sir, but the testimony which apparently was deemed that testimony which was necessary."

1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2986.685,2988.723,Is there a typewritten record here?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,2988.723,2989.884,"No sir, it's not here."

1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3136.185,3154.619,"Before you get to that, may I ask, what about the statement that one of the witnesses made as related by counsel to the effect that during his custody of this jury he made no acquaintances and removed all friendships."
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3154.619,3157.643,I have no explanation for this sir (Voice Overlap)

1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3168.327,3170.594,I say I may have an answer for it.

1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3171.571,3173.589,I say I may have an answer for it.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3173.589,3173.962,Yes.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3176.393,3184.042,I've been assistant district attorney for 10 years and there are many times that I practiced before the Court that I don't even see defendants and witnesses had come there.
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3235.982,3237.812,Well that --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3237.812,3238.09,No sir.
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.094,3270.854,(Inaudible)
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3270.854,3271.735,Sorry.
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.349,3339.049,Or that (Inaudible) indictment?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3339.049,3340.058,His badge?
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.058,3352.013,(Inaudible) distinction between the deputies of the witness and an outsider.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3352.013,3353.475,Personally I don't see it.
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.576,3357.475,"Well, even if one is bad or the other is bad or either --"
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3357.475,3358.491,"Oh, but now wait just a minute."
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.159,3364.746,Well I understand that.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3376.054,3377.19,To talk with the --
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.19,3379.32,-- to associate with the jury like the deputy did.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3379.32,3380.539,Oh no -- no.
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3381.787,3384.815,"Well, I know, I know but I -- forget that case we had."
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3384.815,3385.065,Alright.
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.065,3394.949,"In this particular case, if a witness, a non deputy witness had been allowed to associate with the jury, you would I supposed think it was error."
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3394.949,3397.024,Because then he would be an outsider in the segment.
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.024,3397.521,Yes.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3404.513,3410.452,Because Article 394 of the Louisiana Criminal Code says one is correct and the other is incorrect.
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.452,3422.955,But why do you suppose in actuality or in operative result why is the one bad and the other not?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3426.713,3433.136,"Mr. Justice because when I came up here, yes, that it'd be sworn and there was a certain fellow who've had a job, they do stood right behind me."
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.639,3456.545,So there's some explanation for him being there and he's not been a witness.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3456.545,3466.416,"That's correct, Article 394 of the Louisiana Criminal Code which says that's his duty, that's his job."
1964.53,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3485.334,3486.691,Well I think you went --
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3486.691,3491.591,(Inaudible)
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3491.591,3495.928,"Well the only thing is if we had all the deputies, I wouldn't be here today."
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3495.928,3496.944,Probably whether --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3496.944,3499.55,In other words I wouldn't be here today.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3499.55,3503.952,The problem is you don't have to obviate even in a small parish where there are only two deputies I should think.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3503.952,3505.606,"Well, I'll say this, it's not impossible --"
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3505.606,3511.407,Except in the rare case where all the deputies are going to be prosecution witnesses and (Voice Overlap) so you can prove that you could have special deputies.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3511.407,3517.743,I can say on this particular case that it was quite a general law as far as that was concerned.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3537.352,3539.077,While he was out there apprehended pretty soon after the --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3539.077,3539.908,That's right.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3540.158,3541.362,How long after they admit?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3541.362,3541.742,I beg your pardon.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3541.742,3544.356,How long after the murder when these people were apprehended?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3544.356,3546.748,"Oh, within 8 to 10 hours."
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3549.442,3550.537,Were there any --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3550.537,3550.819,Pardon me --
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3550.819,3553.088,Excuse me.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3556.569,3558.595,Yes sir.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3558.595,3559.345,And how was that handled?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3561.419,3599.168,"We have a group of three doctors appointed to take approximately 30 days within which to review the conditions of the defendants' sanity both at the time of the commission of the crime and as of present and then that commission or that insanity commission reports back to the court its findings and try to go into trial on the merits, the defense is allowed to present that and had that issue passed upon for them to trial on there."
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3599.168,3599.958,By the judge?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3599.958,3601.365,"By the judge, yes."
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3622.954,3628.47,And where -- we're both kind to -- I mean both periods of insanity it opposed here?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3628.47,3629.058,Yes sir.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3629.058,3630.664,"First, is inability to stand trial."
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3630.664,3631.208,That's correct.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3631.208,3632.038,Now it was decided against him by the --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3632.038,3633.415,That was decided against him by the trial judge.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3633.415,3636.067,And then on the trial of the merits --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3636.067,3641.024,The jury decides against him on the question of insanity at the time of the commission of the crime.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3641.024,3644.665,"And was it there before the jury, the report of this lunacy Commissioner --"
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3644.665,3644.735,Yes sir.
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3644.735,3645.554,-- was a relied witness.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3645.554,3662.278,"Not only, not -- no way, not only the report of that commission but the members of the commission have presented to the jury and the judge questions them and the defense counsel is allowed to cross-examine and in addition to that if there's any question in his mind from the time he gets that report, and he gets that report before he goes to trial."
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3672.384,3673.298,The trial judge or --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3673.298,3674.815,"No -- no, it's the defense counsel."
1964.53,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3674.815,3675.446,The defendant?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3675.446,3678.801,"Yes, the defendant."
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3678.801,3684.669,As I understood the counsel that one of these deputies had lunch with the jury.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3684.669,3686.012,That's correct sir.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3686.501,3689.959,Would the statute require that?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3689.959,3692.792,Well if the deputy isn't there they need separation.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3692.792,3695.101,Is that your -- is that your question to down there --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3695.101,3695.609,Yes sir.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3695.609,3697.34,-- to have them get accustomed with --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3697.34,3700.007,"(Voice Overlap) law, they are 27 years and that was the custom when I came there."
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3702.459,3704.668,The deputy's eats -- lunches with the jury?
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3704.668,3707.664,Yes sir.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3727.477,3737.727,Is that an isolated instance and being in Louisiana's provision that the deputy does eat with them frequently.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3737.727,3741.747,I would -- I would mention to say that that's a matter of common practice.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3742.058,3743.008,I have no idea for it.
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3743.008,3743.294,Yes sir.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3743.294,3744.156,It speaks in telling that --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3744.156,3752.866,"Well now, particularly in those parishes where the eating facilities are not available to the jury and the jury room they say."
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3752.866,3754.464,It maybe bad without taking the --
1964.53,1,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,3754.464,3761.24,It maybe bad but I just wonder how it can be avoided.
1964.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3800.82,3802.799,Mr. Pierson.
1964.53,2,15587,allen_bpierson_jr,,3802.799,3805.307,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1964.53,3,35295,leonard_e_yokum,,4348.811,4352.145,Did I understand that you wished the complete transcript sent to you?
1964.53,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4352.145,4353.797,"Yes, we would like them."
1964.53,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4353.797,4355.693,Do you have all of that?
1964.53,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4355.693,4357.308,"Oh, is it here?"
