1957.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,229.584,273.844,"Mr. Sand, may I ask at the outset, in order to appreciate the reach of this -- does the -- in the problem of this kind, appreciate the general problem, but does the specific setting in which the problem arises in the Second Circuit raised the question for all the other circuits or other variations in the different circuits regarding the practice of what they do about, what they say when they file opinions and make docket entries thereon and then later there's a later entry."
1957.79,0,35094,leonard_b_sand,,276.884,287.168,"Well, the crucial question that the Second Circuit has -- has held and the other circuits would agree, is the intent of the -- of the district judge."
1957.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,297.17,308.708,"Well, this -- this question may not -- this -- you -- one cannot say that this raises that question of statutory construction which will hereafter govern every circuit."

1957.79,1,42395,thomas_c_burke,,1812.51,1832.884,"The rule of -- of -- I don't want to dispute the -- the -- but I would like to quote the exact language of the rule which states, ""When the Court directs that a party recover only money, etcetera, the clerk shall enter a judgment forthwith upon receipt by him of the direction."""
1957.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1851.794,1867.976,"Mr. Burke, the -- the complaint is not in the record and I wonder if the judgment, the final judgment, whichever is the final judgment, used judgment for the precise amount paid for in the complaint."
1957.79,1,42395,thomas_c_burke,,1867.976,1877.475,The -- is a -- are you referring to the final judgment as the later document which the judge signed?
1957.79,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1877.475,1887.414,"Well, if -- if not the amount that you have -- you wouldâ€™ve executed on, if you had -- if you had levied under your -- under your judgment as you conceive it."
1957.79,1,42395,thomas_c_burke,,1887.414,1897.336,"Oh, may I say this that the compliant does expressly set forth the amount that was paid and for which suit was being brought."
1957.79,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1908.674,1913.484,(Inaudible) appears from the requirement in the complaint?
1957.79,1,42395,thomas_c_burke,,1918.649,1922.269,The judgment sets forth the -- the amount of the tax that was paid.
1957.79,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1922.269,1923.359,Yes.

1957.79,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3292.606,3293.952,Mr. Chief Justice.
1957.79,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3325.262,3353.269,"That answer -- that answer is based on the assumption that a specific figure in the judges' opinions are not to be deemed incorporated in the judgment, i.e. the entry of April 14th that that's really at the heart of this business, to what extent you can incorporate in an informal statement to formalize terms and statement of the judges' opinion."
1957.79,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3391.284,3394.496,"Well, even if you can, it was not done here."

1957.79,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3418.535,3447.074,"We cite in the -- in our reply brief to page 5, the Treasury regulations which applied at the time -- the District Court rendered its decision in Schaefer and the construction of those by the Internal Revenue service and they would not have made payment unless they were submitted to them a document which contained the exact amount of the recovery."

1957.79,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3476.145,3477.141,"Well, --"
1957.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3477.141,3477.561,-- that -- that's the one you referred to.
1957.79,2,35094,leonard_b_sand,,3477.561,3496.576,-- there was one -- which applied in this -- in this particular case that the prospect of the possibility of the taxpayer going to the Internal Revenue service with this opinion to obtain payment is what is on the (Inaudible).
