1970.97,0,36392,malvine_nathanson,,27.199,30.899,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.97,1,41755,stanley_m_meyer,,1354.632,1362.857,"If the Court please, Chief Justice, I’d like to just mention two things before I actually get into the discussion of the law."
1970.97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1386.473,1391.698,"Well, the problem with that is they have one grand jury, exactly the same time."
1970.97,1,41755,stanley_m_meyer,,1391.698,1395.349,I believe that it was the jury with the same people that heard him testified.
1970.97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1395.349,1396.65,"Sure, that was one grand jury at the same time."
1970.97,1,41755,stanley_m_meyer,,1396.65,1399.901,"Yes, that’s true."
1970.97,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1399.901,1404.812,Would it be in better shape if this case was represented to one or the other one?
1970.97,1,41755,stanley_m_meyer,,1404.812,1406.879,"Your Honor, there's no doubt about that."
1970.97,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.458,1693.644,"What do you think prompted the New York court to change its mind that there wasn’t very much of a change in its personnel, was there?"
1970.97,1,41755,stanley_m_meyer,,1693.644,1703.827,"No, I don’t believe there was any change, it's very interesting, I believe Judge Keating who wrote the majority of opinion had left the court though."
1970.97,2,36392,malvine_nathanson,,3062.228,3077.916,"On this question of the effect of the rule that we state as constitutional required upon criminal prosecutions throughout this entire country, first, I believe the District Attorney has misinterpreted what we state as constitutionally required."
1970.97,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.023,3107.379,How is it important to the use factor?
1970.97,2,36392,malvine_nathanson,,3108.83,3118.78,"Well, we have not proposed that a jurisdiction other than the one which has compelled the testimony be bound by the transactional immunity rule."
