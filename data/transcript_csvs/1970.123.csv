1970.123,0,35092,louis_sherman,,18.716,21.599,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.123,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,21.704,22.548,We’ll just wait.
1970.123,0,35092,louis_sherman,,147.647,150.235,Thank you.
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,1755.843,1756.809,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.809,1770.961,"And that’s what you have to sustain here that this punching the nose, beating whatever, however you describe it, did not violate either one or both of those two clauses I just read?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,1770.961,1772.615,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1773.551,1780.977,"That’ll call for some explanation for me, so I hope at sometime in your argument you’ll dwell on it a little bit anyway."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,1780.977,1783.22,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1813.148,1814.781,Where was it tried?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,1814.781,1824.642,"It was tried in Mobile, Alabama before Judge Daniel Thomas, Justice Black."
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.315,2072.112,Do you think the situation would be any different if instead of saying “guilty as charged” they said “We find the two brothers guilty” and then recited the original charge in --
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2072.112,2075.299,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I do think it would’ve been different."
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2075.936,2077.054,Tell me how in --
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2077.054,2079.235,I think this.
1970.123,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2121.797,2126.733,"Mr. Sherman, get to that second point of expulsion."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2145.232,2147.608,"Mr. Justice Marshall, that is correct."
1970.123,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2147.608,2151.426,"Well, isn’t that dissention?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2151.426,2153.217,"No sir, it’s not."
1970.123,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.217,2155.373,"Well, is it mild disapproval?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2155.373,2156.041,Sir?
1970.123,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.041,2160.851,Is it mild disapproval?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2160.851,2166.403,It would not be dissention within the meaning of Article XIII (1).
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2190.167,2191.259,Defense legal isn’t it?
1970.123,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.259,2192.763,"Well, suppose he punched, didn’t want some meeting?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2192.763,2193.346,Sir?
1970.123,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.346,2197.62,Suppose he punched the business manager once in a meeting?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2197.62,2198.417,Well --
1970.123,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2198.417,2199.95,"You know, the one by group, you know?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2199.95,2200.629,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2215.66,2218.822,Nobody asks you to take judicial notice of that.
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2218.822,2219.917,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.868,2257.85,Did he ask for some sort of special verdict here?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2262.841,2269.006,"No sir, but I do not think that’s of course, that wasn't an issue in the case either, but I don’t think --"
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2269.006,2276.945,"It might be if he didn’t ask for what you’re asking for now, that might have a lot to do whether he was entitled to it, or whether he waived it?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2276.945,2283.357,"Well, sir that was not within the procedure of the union remedies."
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.357,2287.659,"I think it stopped you from asking for it, because you’re asking for it now."
1970.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.659,2291.387,"Well Mr. McDonald, I think you may have gotten it without asking for it, didn’t you?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2311.29,2315.787,"I did not notice that Mr. Justice White, but apparently it is."
1970.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.787,2324.013,"Well, they certainly referred to it in the letter explaining what happened when his case was affirmed in the union."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2342.423,2344.35,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2390.946,2391.613,Either one?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2391.613,2392.496,Sir?
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2392.496,2393.529,"Either one, either charges?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2393.529,2394.125,No sir.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2400.625,2401.798,Which is -- which one?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2401.798,2403.777,The automatic expulsion.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2403.777,2405.491,I mean which is the charge there?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2407.197,2414.811,The charge is that he created dissention among the membership to create a division of funds.
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2417.53,2419.947,Or work against the interest and harmony of the Brotherhood.
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2419.947,2421.96,"Of the International Brotherhood, yes sir."
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2421.96,2429.625,"If you permit me to say so, I frankly do not at all understand what you are offering as a defense."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2441.027,2442.827,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2442.827,2446.174,Are you defending on the ground that he didn’t assault him and beat him up?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2446.174,2447.799,No sir.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2457.64,2460.364,"That was the central thing they charged against him, wasn’t it?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2460.364,2470.062,"Yes sir, but in doing that, they said that this act itself is a violation of Section 13 (1) which carries with it an automatic expulsion."
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2470.062,2471.812,"Well, why do you say it’s not a violation?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2476.123,2483.527,Because this was a personal thing between Mr. Hardeman and the business agent Mr. Justice Brennan.
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2494.423,2513.195,"No but, Mr. McDonald, what it leads 13 (1) is any member who endeavors to create dissention among the members, stop right there, to beat up the business agent, that’s not an endeavored or could not be found to be an endeavored to create dissention among the members?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2513.195,2519.552,"No sir, I submit its not, because I submit in interpreting this Section, you cannot stop right there, because --"
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2519.552,2521.624,"Well, may I go to the next one for a moment?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2521.624,2522.284,Sir?
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2522.284,2524.32,May I go up to the next point there?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2537.229,2545.393,"No sir, because that is a personal thing and this prohibits an attack against the organization itself, the organizational structure."
1970.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.393,2552.622,And who’s the -- isn’t the top authority in the union the lodge itself?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2552.622,2553.895,Well the top authority --
1970.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.895,2556.077,Didn’t you appeal to the lodge?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2556.077,2564.054,"No Mr. Justice White, the trial was in the lodge, the local lodge, and appeal went to the executive council of the International."
1970.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.054,2564.749,"Well, everybody --"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2564.749,2567.454,And then to the Executive President.
1970.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.454,2582.54,"There were 61 votes in the lodge against 36 (2) -- who thought that this was a violation of Section 13, and the top appellate authority in construing the constitution within the lodge thought it was a violation of 13."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2582.54,2584.269,"Mr. Justice White, I don’t --"
1970.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.269,2589.443,Aren’t those actions worth some --
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2589.443,2591.489,I don’t think that is the case.
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2606.733,2613.224,Well that Mr. McDonald is look at page 56 on exhibit 2.
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2613.224,2619.451,"Mr. Justice Brennan, pardon me sir, you’re in the appendix, page 56."
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2619.451,2634.246,"The exhibit 2 has that at its heading to the left is a column 61-4 and 36 against, and the right to that party is guilty as charged, 61 to sustain 36 to reject."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2640.155,2656.476,"On the basis that at a meeting a motion was offered to the membership saying “We have found -- the trial board has heard the evidence, and having heard the evidence, they find him guilty."
1970.123,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.216,2672.999,Without knowing anything -- you say nobody knew anything about it himself unless you get a 61 to 36 vote?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2672.999,2673.454,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2680.397,2687.891,"Well, does the record show what was presented to the lodge when that vote was taken, or before that vote was taken?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2687.891,2690.049,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I believe it does."
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2715.879,2717.251,What did they hold?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2717.251,2724.086,They held the same thing as the guilty as charged in accepting the finding of the trial board.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2724.086,2726.461,Did that ended so far as they were concerned?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2726.461,2727.388,No sir.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2734.295,2735.441,What did he do?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2735.441,2742.201,He examined the transcript of the executive council hearing and of the local lodge hearing.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2742.201,2744.137,What conclusion did he reach?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2744.137,2747.529,He reached the same conclusion not to disturb the finding.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2747.529,2750.776,Was that the end of it so far as the lodge was concerned?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2750.776,2753.109,That was the end of it as far as the whole union was concerned.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2753.109,2756.352,Why did he not attack that in court?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2762.278,2763.776,The reason he did not --
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2763.776,2767.781,"-- was wrong, why not go to the court?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2767.781,2772.68,"Well, the reason for it, Mr. Justice Black was because of a real solution."
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2799.311,2800.082,"Well, he can work it back."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2800.082,2800.644,Sir?
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2800.644,2803.833,"He didn’t want to get back to him, well how can he get damages for not getting back?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2803.833,2807.598,He can get damages under Section 412.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2838.637,2843.18,Without going to court to see whether his expulsion was right or wrong?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2843.18,2846.027,"Yes sir, that’s what the Act says."
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2846.027,2852.933,Did this Court here try that question as to whether he’d been properly expelled?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2852.933,2854.535,No sir.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2854.615,2857.882,"That’s never been tried at all then, is it?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2857.882,2870.073,"That is at issue in this case, because the whole heart of this damage suit is that the complaint says that we were improperly expelled because we did not have a full and fair hearing."
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2874.468,2882.597,"You can have a full one because you didn’t go and ask for judicial review, if you didn’t have it?"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2882.597,2883.155,Well we had a --
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2883.155,2889.258,I don’t understand how you could attack this expulsion without attacking it directly in court.
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2889.258,2890.813,We did in this particular case.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2890.813,2895.339,"Yes we did from another case, but you say you didn’t try it out in the court."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2895.339,2898.666,"Yes sir we did, and I’m sorry I misunderstood you Justice Black."
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2898.666,2901.073,To show that he was improperly expelled?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2901.073,2901.516,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2901.516,2906.909,Or did you just submit this technical argument you have about the two charges?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2906.909,2937.565,"That, Mr. Justice Black, the two charges was the basis of our -- him being found guilty of a charge for which there was no evidence to support him, was the basis of our theory that our evidence in court that he did not -- was not given a full and fair hearing because he was at same position as a man on trial under two-count indictment and one count the evidence conformed into one count but not conformed to the other."
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2941.586,2946.317,"Well, then to pursue your analogy, I go back to what I suggested before."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2968.693,2970.433,"No sir, because --"
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.433,2974.282,"I think you will look at the books, you’ll find they do with a great deal."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,2977.86,2990.168,"Well the point here Mr. Justice Burger is that if he’s guilty of one, you’re saying here is that he could get the same punishment under both charges."
1970.123,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2998.568,3004.659,"But here out of the Court of Appeals opinion, see if this is the heart of the case."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3033.794,3040.591,"That’s true, but the Court of Appeals reviewed all of the transcript and the evidence that was taken on this matter."
1970.123,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3040.591,3046.826,I don’t see how they could reach a conclusion myself or you may explain it to me.
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3060.359,3061.233,Well --
1970.123,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3061.233,3062.737,"Mr. McDonald, let me add to this."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3062.737,3063.086,Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1970.123,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3063.086,3066.037,And I think it brings us back to Justice White’s question.
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3076.743,3077.051,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3077.051,3079.047,But whose function is it to interpret that?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3080.578,3094.811,It should be the plain meaning of the particular charge because included in Section 101 (a) (5) (b)is a requirement that the member be given specific charges.
1970.123,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3112.576,3127.849,"Well, it’s perfectly obvious that the members of the Court are disturbed about how you reached the result that beating up the business agent didn’t create dissention among the members, or work against the interest and harmony of the Brotherhood."
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3134.676,3156.888,"Your Honor, I think Mr. Justice Blackmun, when you read the Article together in its context, it becomes obvious of course, maybe it doesn’t, but it becomes obvious to me and apparently to the justices who have reviewed this that this Article prohibits some attack against the organizational structure itself."
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3162.713,3174.253,(Inaudible)
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3174.253,3179.436,The court should decide within the plain meaning of the ordinary meaning of a particular Section.
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3179.436,3188.003,"Well, this is the course, Mr. McDonald, whether the Court could have anything to do with what it means, whether or not its interpretation is entirely --"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3188.003,3198.709,"Your Honor, I think that Congress has issued a mandate that the Court do it, because Congress has said that no member shall be expelled without a full and fair hearing."
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3206.709,3230.516,"In your argument is that we have to -- the courts have to be here in saying what did 101 (a) (5) (b) when it says that must be before the court, and that you say that you didn't have any obligation of the court and obligation to interpret what is then by grace the section --"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3230.516,3231.816,Yes sir.
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3247.358,3248.244,"Well, what’s the difference --"
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3248.244,3248.768,Now --
1970.123,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3248.768,3249.77,-- that I’ve been talking about?
1970.123,1,39921,robert_e_mcdonald_jr,,3249.77,3270.716,"No sir because, I submit it’s not, because if you’re going to say “Look and see if there’s some evidence” we’ve got to interpret the charge to see if there’s some evidence, otherwise you’d be in the position of trying to decide an embezzlement case from the facts without looking to see the meaning of the embezzlement statute."
1970.123,2,35092,louis_sherman,,3561.679,3575.652,"Yes, one small point and that is to call the attention of the Court to defendant’s exhibit number 3 at page 61, which is the out of work card of the union."
1970.123,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3613.823,3614.904,Thank you Mr. Sherman.
