1996.95-1764,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.067,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1764, Saratoga Fishing Company v. J. M. Martinac & Company."
1996.95-1764,0,34028,keith_zakarin,,11.888,17.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1764,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.066,83.828,"Mr. Zakarin, is it not possible in contract suit to recover also damages for property that it is clear would be at risk if the item sold were destroyed?"
1996.95-1764,0,34028,keith_zakarin,,83.828,85.08,Justice O'Connor--
1996.95-1764,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,85.08,88.402,"I mean, there's some leeway, is there not, under a contract theory?"
1996.95-1764,0,34028,keith_zakarin,,88.402,95.468,"--Justice O'Connor, that depends, of course, upon the existence both of privity and the scope of the contract at issue."
1996.95-1764,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.422,136.357,"Well, but even in the East River situation where you're dealing with commercial sellers, if you would... you may not want to concede that, but assuming we're dealing with a commercial seller and a commercial buyer, does East River indicate that a contract recovery, if it were available for these other things, should be applied?"
1996.95-1764,0,34028,keith_zakarin,,136.357,145.296,"Ordinarily, the answer is... the answer is that East River is silent as to the recovery in a particular contract of those items."
1996.95-1764,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.98,173.035,"Well, do you think East River meant to not go as far as, say, Hadley v. Baxendale would?"
1996.95-1764,0,34028,keith_zakarin,,173.035,185.764,"The standards for recovery of damages are different in tort and in contract, and I do not believe that East River necessarily sets those parameters."
1996.95-1764,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.32,198.051,"That's Hadley v. Baxendale, too, is it not?"
1996.95-1764,0,34028,keith_zakarin,,198.051,198.883,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1764,1,21286,daniel_b_macleod,,1702.168,1709.614,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.652,1739.345,"May I ask you two questions, just to be sure I understand part of the case?"
1996.95-1764,1,21286,daniel_b_macleod,,1748.06,1752.654,Probably.
1996.95-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.769,1772.106,"Assume the bargain included warranties on the ship itself but nothing more, and then you add the... Madruga added the additional equipment, which was lost in the... for tortious reasons."
1996.95-1764,1,21286,daniel_b_macleod,,1773.558,1774.139,"--Yes, I think so."
1996.95-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.139,1774.489,All right.
1996.95-1764,1,21286,daniel_b_macleod,,1798.395,1800.037,"I think not, Your Honor."
1996.95-1764,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1812.376,1816.88,"But Madruga then would be the person who suffered the loss, but it would have been by paying its customer."
1996.95-1764,1,21286,daniel_b_macleod,,1822.324,1843.008,"I think the proper focus is on the benefits and the responsibilities of the bargaining of the commercial contracting parties, and if Mr. Madruga chose for one reason or another to extend a warranty on the equipment that he put aboard, or extend the original manufacturer's warranty, I think that's Mr. Madruga's problem, and I think undoubtedly he would be compensated for it in the purchase price."
1996.95-1764,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1843.008,1851.895,It seems to me that Madruga... let's assume that Madruga just sold one vessel.
1996.95-1764,1,21286,daniel_b_macleod,,1885.447,1886.999,"Actually that was the second purchaser, Your Honor."
