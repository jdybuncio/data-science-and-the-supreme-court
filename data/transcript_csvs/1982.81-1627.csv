1982.81-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.387,We will hear arguments next in Shepard against National Labor Relations Board.
1982.81-1627,0,39401,robert_f_gore,,42.061,50.101,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic dispute in this case has been going on for 12 years."
1982.81-1627,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.013,200.4,"The ALJ doesn't himself issue cease and desist orders, does he?"
1982.81-1627,0,39401,robert_f_gore,,200.4,207.087,"--Justice Rehnquist, he issues a proposed decision order, and if it is not appealed to the Board, it becomes a final order."
1982.81-1627,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.087,207.805,That becomes a final order?
1982.81-1627,0,39401,robert_f_gore,,207.805,209.587,Yes.
1982.81-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,234.466,236.778,"Will you identify that footnote for us, since you seem to--"
1982.81-1627,0,39401,robert_f_gore,,236.778,245.493,"--It is Footnote 2, Mr. Chief Justice, and it would be in the petition for certiorari."
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1365.046,1394.803,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this Court has long recognized that Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act vests the Board with broad discretion to fashion the remedy for an unfair labor practice that it believes is appropriate to effectuate the policies of the Act."
1982.81-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1435.628,1446.434,What if the... What if it is proved satisfactorily that the agreement causes the kind of... an independent businessman to join the union?
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1446.434,1469.284,"Mr. Justice White, unless the union resorted to conduct that would independently violate Section 8(b)(4), either to force the employer to sign the agreement in the first instance or after it was signed to force the employer to abide by it, of course, in that situation there would be a damage remedy under Section 303."
1982.81-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.345,1475.126,"Yes, a coercion on the employee or the independent contractor employee is irrelevant--"
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1475.126,1475.75,That's right.
1982.81-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.498,1495.306,"--The coercion might... exercised against these independent operators might violate some other provision, but it wouldn't violate 8(b)(4)."
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1495.306,1530.823,"--That's correct, and if I could just make one additional point on that, the decision of the Administrative Law Judge only says on Page 43a of the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari, says that the... it having been found that the union and the associations enforced provisions of the MLA requiring owner-operators to make payments to the union of dues, initiation fees, assessments, and contributions to trust funds in violation of Section 8(e), it would then... the ALJ would then recommend an order of the refunds."
1982.81-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.993,1538.88,Or even coercion.
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1538.88,1551.769,"Coercion perhaps in some other sense, but the type of coercion to which Section 8(b)(4) speaks, it would not, and in fact this Court's decisions in Servett and Teamsters versus Morton make that unmistakably clear."
1982.81-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.753,1709.921,"Of course, one could affirm the judgment below and rule basically in the Board's favor without coming to any conclusion as to whether an 8(e) violation might be remediable under 303."
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1709.921,1730.116,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but... and we are not saying by the same token that the failure of Congress to provide a damage remedy under Section 303 forecloses the Board itself from awarding a reimbursement in an unfair labor practice proceeding."
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.505,1738.909,Didn't the Board rely on... or did it?
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1746.611,1747.734,--It did.
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.734,1749.563,And you say that is wrong.
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1749.563,1750.39,No.
1982.81-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.876,1860.749,Mr. Kneedler--
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1860.749,1861.249,Yes.
1982.81-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.249,1865.453,--Mr. Gore told us that the 8(b)(4) charges were withdrawn.
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1869.091,1871.139,"Well, my understanding--"
1982.81-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1871.139,1871.965,"--the significance of that, if any?"
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1871.965,1873.011,--Excuse me?
1982.81-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.011,1876.761,"Comment on the significance of that, if any, in your view?"
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1876.761,1908.651,"Well, the original charge filed by Mr. Shepard was based on or alleged what amounted to an 8(b)(4) violation, alleging, incidentally, not that the union was coercing Mr. Shepard, but consistent with the secondary aspect of Section 8(b)(4), alleged that the union was coercing Terra, the broker, by virtue of the existence of the agreement."
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.401,2065.068,Why would you draw the difference between... The person against whom the secondary pressure is applied is these owner-operators.
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2091.34,2092.26,--Right.
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.26,2116.331,"Now, however, in this case, you say because it is only an 8(e) violation, namely, no pressure on the employer, the owner-operators who would be in exactly the same position as if the employer was pressured, they have suffered the same injury, shouldn't have the same remedy that they would have had if the employer had been pressured."
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2116.331,2120.032,"Well, under... depending on... two remedies."
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.262,2129.59,Yes.
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2129.59,2147.161,"With respect to Section 10(c), in order to... the general remedial provision for the Board to award relief, the important point to recognize there is that Section 10(c) is not a replication of a private damage action such as 303."
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.326,2184.538,"So if both the employer and the union want to damage these people together, and they both agree to it, there is no injury, but if only the union wants to damage him and pressures the employer into it, there is injury, there is a compensable injury?"
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2184.538,2201.563,"--Well, again, under Section 303, that is the distinction that Congress has drawn, and what we are saying is that at the very least, it cannot be an abuse of discretion for the Board to draw a parallel judgment in its administration of the administrative unfair labor practice proceedings."
1982.81-1627,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2279.826,2280.513,Mr. Kneedler--
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2280.513,2280.903,--Yes?
1982.81-1627,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2280.903,2288.136,"--it isn't really clear, though, is it, why the Board denied the relief here?"
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2299.835,2306.909,"Well, the Board did say that... well, it said several things."
1982.81-1627,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2311.783,2316.45,You seem to agree that that was probably erroneous.
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2316.45,2319.012,"No, I don't concede that that was erroneous."
1982.81-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2334.002,2349.776,"What sort of relief was the Board talking about being... when the Board said as one of its reasons for not granting the relief Petitioners here sought, that relief is available in the district court under 303, what kind of relief was the Board thinking of?"
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2349.776,2375.533,"--No, it was... as I interpret the Board's order, its point was that Congress has dealt with several, but one being that when you have third parties who are injured by a union's secondary activity, Congress provided a separate forum for a person to recover for a union's secondary... unlawful secondary activities."
1982.81-1627,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2383.811,2385.199,"Well, you do agree with that?"
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2385.199,2414.594,"--I do agree with that, but I draw the opposite conclusion from that than Petitioner does, because Congress's foreclosing of a damage remedy for the individual demonstrates that Congress did not believe that monetary relief was necessary as a rule to effectuate the policies of the Act, and the Board has simply made a parallel judgment in administering the separate administrative proceedings under Section 10(c)."
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.904,2774.885,"What does the Board do, or do you know, in an 8(b)(4)... suppose the owner-operators here had filed an 8(b)(4) and proved it?"
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2774.885,2775.837,Well--
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.837,2779.806,"And it had been adjudicated, an 8(b)(4) violation."
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2782.068,2783.679,"--Yes, in fact--"
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.679,2785.242,And would they?
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2785.242,2791.832,--The Santini Brothers decision that we cite in our brief is precisely that situation.
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.832,2793.895,And generally they do in that case?
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2793.895,2796.126,"Well, it has not come up that often, but Santini Brothers--"
1982.81-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2796.126,2797.642,But that is monetary relief.
1982.81-1627,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2797.642,2806.498,"--That is monetary relief, but it also contains the element of coercion in the 8(b)(4) violation, which is consistent with Congress's judgment in 303."
1982.81-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3176.36,3177.189,Very well.
1982.81-1627,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3178.749,3181.328,"Just a few comments, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1627,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3204.584,3210.286,"I was asking him only the significance of it, if any, not the reasons why--"
1982.81-1627,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3210.286,3216.797,"--He correctly stated what the Board quite often does, but it is not in the record why it was done in this case."
1982.81-1627,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3240.85,3247.565,"--Well, did the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit remand the case to the Board?"
1982.81-1627,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3250.158,3257.687,"Yes, sir, and I think it is presently pending on cert. What it did is, it ordered the Board to make whole remedy or to show cause why it would not effectuate--"
1982.81-1627,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.687,3258.374,Under 8(e).
1982.81-1627,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3258.374,3259.169,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-1627,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.169,3263.466,And the Board... what action did the Board take?
1982.81-1627,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3263.466,3268.403,"I believe it is sitting here, Number 82-3."
1982.81-1627,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.167,3269.573,"Oh, I see."
1982.81-1627,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3270.821,3271.262,"No, sir."
1982.81-1627,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.823,3275.851,So the Board has never had a chance to give more than three lines.
1982.81-1627,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3275.851,3277.068,--Exactly.
1982.81-1627,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3384.004,3388.488,Very well.
