1963.49,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.726,187.982,-- understand what determines whether a helper is to become an upgraded helper.
1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,187.982,195.011,"The -- the record indicates â€“ there was a lot of argument, Justice Stewart in the record about whether upgrading is automatic."
1963.49,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.885,199.261,Was it not really an issue here?
1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,199.261,200.633,I don't think it's an issue at all.
1963.49,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,200.633,201.73,These people all were upgraded.
1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,201.73,206.339,"They were all upgraded when they went and this is also true in the next -- well, in the next case as an apprentice."
1963.49,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.339,206.445,But you're --
1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,206.445,207.627,I don't think it's an issue at all.
1963.49,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,207.627,215.396,"But you're assuming that there maybe or was some discretion, management discretion in determining whether or not a helper, these helpers should become upgraded helper but in any --"

1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,219.028,220.65,"Exactly, exactly."
1963.49,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,222.902,224.815,Under the bridge or over the dam.
1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,224.815,241.537,"But -- when -- because they were passed by when they return and completed their 1040 days of work, they found that formerly junior upgraded helpers already had carman status and seniority."
1963.49,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,437.735,438.902,(Inaudible)
1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,438.902,439.812,"Yes, Justice Goldberg."
1963.49,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,439.812,460.632,Assuming the -- that was referred to (Inaudible)
1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,460.632,471.606,The record indicates that this has never happened without the employee's -- without the employee's agreement in the history -- in the -- in the memory of anyone that was present.
1963.49,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,486.41,492.309,(Inaudible)
1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,492.309,501.219,"Adequate -- adequate performance Justice Goldberg, we would insist, is always a condition of a -- of continuing seniority in the simplest case."

1963.49,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,516.511,527.517,In the Brooks -- the Brooks case which is the next case Mr. Chief Justice is an apprenticeship and I will argue in that case with the exact same rule applies that there's no difference between the cases.
1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1127.413,1131.363,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1452.717,1453.864,That's correct.
1963.49,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1463.406,1471.922,And there's no argument (Inaudible)
1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1471.922,1472.487,They were upgraded --
1963.49,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1472.487,1473.574,(Inaudible)
1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1473.574,1475.875,-- before they went into military service.
1963.49,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.645,1487.315,(Inaudible)
1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1487.315,1493.157,"In a sense, the contract that -- that's what I want to get into immediately."

1963.49,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.403,1529.122,-- to any -- any way of determining the up -- upgrading?
1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1529.122,1537.665,"If the man proved inept at the work, he could be demoted and -- and put back to working as a carman helper, certainly."
1963.49,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1541.452,1547.757,(Inaudible)
1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1547.757,1549.978,"Work in a carman's position, yes sir."
1963.49,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1549.978,1551.976,(Inaudible)-- as a carman helper.
1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1551.976,1552.816,That's right.
1963.49,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1552.816,1553.841,(Inaudible)
1963.49,1,40839,robert_w_yost,,1553.841,1562.724,And -- and -- and I want you to bear in mind also that the 1040 days is not a four-year calendar period of any kind.
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,2697.558,2702.232,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.158,2962.643,"(Inaudible) they must -- what was at the Diehl principle, the thought that -- that he would have acquired the proper level of skill simply by being on the job."
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,2977.008,2984.118,"Mr. Justice White, I don't think we -- no, I don't think this Court should say that he would've obtained any degree of skill."
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.296,2987.802,But you don't think there's any element of that at that stage?
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,2987.802,2988.182,"No, I --"
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.182,2990.798,(Inaudible)
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,2990.798,3004.056,"Actually, all that is required for their two -- the two things I have to respond to, all that's required to do a day's work as a carman for an upgraded helper is to perform adequately."
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.153,3030.521,"Well, what was the -- can you tell me what the purpose is in (Inaudible), wasn't it in 1040 days and what is the purpose of these three, isn't this an apprenticeship to learn something or is it just a fact that you've got a lot of people that --"
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3030.521,3030.99,We've --
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.99,3033.151,-- that are -- want the same job.
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3033.151,3042.953,"Well, we've taken this case on the assumption that it's a training period, though -- though all that is required to become a carman after 1040 days is the 1040th day of work."
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.953,3044.131,(Inaudible)
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3044.131,3046.025,"Right, we've taken it as a training period."
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.83,3059.682,"But the fact is -- but -- but the -- that one of the -- one of the realities is that the situation, if it is a training period, it must be and this is (Inaudible) training, you don't get any more work."
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3059.682,3063.394,I think it -- you have to satisfactorily perform as the carman.
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.869,3072.589,Did that involved -- it does involve --
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3072.589,3072.819,That's right.
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.819,3075.409,-- the 1040 days worth of experience as (Voice Overlap) --
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3075.409,3075.711,That's --
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.711,3076.442,-- what do you think that --
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3076.442,3077.465,That's correct.
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3077.465,3085.462,Do you think that's an automatic thing that anybody would acquire simply by being there based on the work?
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3085.462,3092.124,"Your Honor, on the -- it -- it of course isn't absolutely automatic."
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.539,3094.098,Do I understand (Voice Overlap) --
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3094.098,3094.569,Someone could've been sick.

1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3099.884,3100.403,That's all.
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.835,3112.117,Suppose this really --
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3112.117,3113.272,-- the possibility of getting --

1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.73,3119.459,The work period.
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3119.459,3121.842,It's a work period.
1963.49,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.236,3132.801,(Inaudible)
1963.49,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3132.801,3133.109,Yes.
