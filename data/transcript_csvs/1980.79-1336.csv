1980.79-1336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.981,We will hear arguments next in Chicago and North Western v. Kalo Brick & Tile.
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,11.216,16.823,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.441,116.815,"What was the nature of the ICC proceeding, Mr. Johnson?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,116.815,120.922,--The ICC proceeding was an abandonment application.
1980.79-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.802,244.544,"What if the shipper had sought to sue the Railroad under the Hepburn Act, under the Carmack Amendment to the ICC, is federal court jurisdiction there exclusive?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,244.544,255.587,Section 9 would permit a damage action to be filed before the Commission or in federal district court.
1980.79-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,272.064,276.624,But what if it were... you say then that it couldn't be filed in the state court?
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,276.624,279.873,"No, because, if you look at--"
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.873,280.451,"No, what?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,282.169,291.009,"--No, you could not file an action claiming violation of the Interstate Commerce Act in state court."
1980.79-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.432,419.817,But it's one thing to say that the body of law has to be common and uniform; but it's another thing to say that concurrent jurisdiction exists between the state courts and the federal courts in applying that uniform body of law.
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,419.817,438.965,"The Esch Car Service Act, and in the context of this case, more importantly, I think, the Transportation Act of 1920 evidence a new and radically different philosophy of Congress with regard to regulation of interstate commerce."
1980.79-1336,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,564.963,568.898,Would your position here be any different if ten percent of the shipments were intrastate?
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,568.898,587.001,"That issue has been addressed by some state courts and that percentage; basically, in state courts, most of the state courts have said, that's not enough intrastate commerce to set aside the overriding national interest."
1980.79-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.125,686.397,"You say, then, that the State of Iowa can't tell a railroad it must provide the cap service to a particular plant, even though it doesn't conflict directly with the ICC provisions?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,686.397,698.643,The State of Iowa cannot require provision of interstate car service under state law.
1980.79-1336,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.712,809.145,"Mr. Johnson, do I correctly understand that this argument based on the absence of any state law duty is equally strong if there had been no abandonment proceeding?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,812.66,813.596,I do not.
1980.79-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,948.089,956.726,Do you say the plaintiff could attack the action of the Railroad either before the ICC or in the federal district court?
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,956.726,964.613,Under Section 9 the plaintiff may seek damages in either of those forums for a violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.613,986.855,"But, if he sues in the federal district court, don't the controlling cases suggest or hold that the district court should refer the guts of the case to the ICC?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,986.855,997.24,"I feel that in the situation we have in this case, where you have physical impassability of the line, I think a district court, where you're talking about awarding damages--"
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.24,999.676,"Well, whether the suspension of service was justified or not?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,999.676,1000.208,--Yes.
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.004,1003.066,Or would they have to?
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1003.988,1007.127,--I believe they would.
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.314,1012.157,Because of primary jurisdiction?
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1012.157,1012.579,--Yes.
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.839,1037.225,"Suppose the reference was made and the ICC ruled that cessation was proper and no damages, can the district court them come to the contrary conclusion?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1037.225,1038.287,"--Well, that's an appealable decision."
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.287,1041.067,"Well, so in that very case?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1046.86,1047.282,Yes.
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.282,1047.938,Right?
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1047.938,1049.501,"Yes, I think it's--"
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.501,1052.983,So the district court can't come to a contrary conclusion?
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1052.983,1063.964,"--Well, I think if the district court decided in the facts of the case that it required the discretion or expertise of the Commission referred it, then the district court would follow the Commission's ruling."
1980.79-1336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.992,1084.003,"But what if it decided that it should have the benefit of the Commission's views, the Commission said the abandonment was justified, could the district court overturn that finding of the Commission?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1084.003,1089.0,"No, I believe that the district court--"
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.0,1091.358,Don't you have to appeal that to the Court of Appeals now?
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1091.358,1091.874,--Yes.
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.07,1117.146,"Well, suppose you start off with damages before the Commission, don't go to the district court, what kind of a proceeding is that?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1118.785,1121.112,"Yes, as I understand it."
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.909,1128.797,"Well, then what if the ICC says the cessation was justified?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1128.797,1132.233,--Then they would not award damages.
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.233,1144.399,"Well, and then... let's assume you then go to the district court, would the Railroad... I suppose you would suggest the Railroad would plead res judicata?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1144.399,1145.946,"Yes, I think it would be preclusive."
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.946,1152.038,"There's no difference between that case, and than when you start off in the district court, is there?"
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1152.038,1152.865,"In the state court, you mean?"
1980.79-1336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.865,1153.787,"No, in the district."
1980.79-1336,0,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,1153.787,1155.77,If there's primary jurisdiction.
1980.79-1336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1166.36,1173.92,Mr. Rush.
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1173.92,1178.105,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1303.087,1318.033,"Mr. Rush, what do you do with that last paragraph in Stroud that says the state law has no application to the furnishing of cars to shippers for the transportation of freight in interstate commerce?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1318.033,1322.282,"Well, I would hang my hat on it, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1387.099,1393.206,"Is it a form of review, in a sense, of the Commission's action?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1396.971,1398.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, that thought hadn't occurred to me."
1980.79-1336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1409.7,1411.7,"It has the same consequence, does it not?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1411.7,1412.45,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-1336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1412.45,1416.072,As though they were reviewing you and the Commission and reversing you?
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1416.072,1420.539,"Yes, I think it would."
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1445.171,1450.684,"Well, would the state court be bound by the action that it got back from the ICC?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1450.684,1451.714,A state court?
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.474,1488.419,"Then, you don't really have a uniform system if, as your colleague contends, where you have it in the federal court alone, since the federal court according to you is not bound to follow the ICC."
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1488.419,1504.444,"No, but it would be subject to normal principles of judicial review so that provided the reasoning was sound and we stayed within out statutory authority, they would be obligated to follow it, in my view."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.444,1510.926,Why wouldn't that be reviewable in the Court of Appeals rather than in the district court?
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1510.926,1516.845,"Because if it were referred, initial review is by law in the district court that referred it."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.845,1519.829,That's because of the referral statute?
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1519.829,1520.969,"Yes, Justice White."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.635,1538.336,"But review is on the record, isn't it, or is it?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1538.336,1544.427,"Yes, it would be on the record, just as any other agency proceeding."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.911,1547.88,"But the district court couldn't rehear the whole matter, could it?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1549.894,1550.394,"--No, sir."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.863,1551.394,Why?
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1551.394,1558.048,"--It would be my view they cannot review it ab initio, that they would have to accept the record made before the Commission."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.375,1562.858,"And if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, accept them."
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1562.858,1563.671,--That's correct.
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.29,1661.569,And then the Commission's decision is reviewable only in the normal appellate process?
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1661.569,1662.6,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.573,1902.895,"Is primary jurisdiction simply a question of deferral and then the Court ultimately deciding, or is it a question that the Court simply keeps its hands off and it's a decision for the Commission to finally make?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1902.895,1913.375,"Literally, as I've always considered the doctrine, it means that the Court must defer initially to a decision by the Commission."
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.375,1915.781,"When you say ""initially"", what do you mean?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1915.781,1927.12,"Well, it's subject to... as I indicated to you earlier, Justice Rehnquist, a review on the traditional grounds of judicial review of Commission decisions."
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.634,1943.521,"It's not like a review under the Administrative Procedure Act, where any agency action can be reviewed for it's arbitrary or contrary to law."
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1943.521,1952.094,"--No, sir, I'm suggesting it is comparable to APA review, but that is a very limiting type of review."
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.614,1998.232,"Well, then, for your counsel or your associate counsel for the Railroad to state that the courthouse at Fort Dodge is only four miles or four blocks away, is really rather elusive so far as the plaintiff is concerned because it means that the plaintiff has to come back to Washington."
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,1998.232,2002.652,"I'm not sure that I follow that argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.652,2010.135,"Well, I mean, you can't get a final trial of your case in the federal court if you're right."
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,2010.135,2011.165,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.79-1336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.04,2016.756,Everybody all over the country has to come back to Washington and try their case before the ICC.
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,2016.756,2020.489,"Well, I would modify that only in one respect, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1336,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2054.164,2077.983,"As I understand it, Mr. Rush, your position is that there is no room here for the doctrine of primary jurisdiction or for a reference to the Commission by a state court, but that the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act and its companion legislation means that state courts are completely ousted from jurisdiction in this field."
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,2078.608,2079.154,"That's correct, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.856,2085.558,"Do you mean, not only state law is ousted but the state courts are ousted?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,2088.619,2091.118,"Yes, I would think that's correct."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.021,2100.287,"Oh, it is under the National Labor Relations Act."
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,2108.629,2110.643,"Yes, sir, although our--"
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.643,2118.28,"Do you think, here... have there been some holdings that federal court jurisdiction is exclusive?"
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,2118.28,2122.278,"--That's correct, Your Honor, under Section 9 of our Act."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.934,2125.543,Does the present Act say so?
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,2127.698,2135.757,"--No, but the way those cases go, since it says you may bring it in federal court, that that means you must, if you're complaining under it."
1980.79-1336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.757,2136.273,I see; yes.
1980.79-1336,1,27892,henri_f_rush_jr,,2136.273,2137.819,Thank you.
1980.79-1336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.819,2141.817,Mr. Blackburn.
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2141.817,2144.941,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2179.819,2181.754,By that you mean that it would go to the state courts first?
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2181.754,2183.02,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2184.769,2186.939,On the abandonment of an interstate line?
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2186.939,2200.683,"--The facts of this case, Your Honor, show that the railroad was neglected over a long period of time and ultimately failed because of that neglect."
1980.79-1336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2224.471,2233.733,"But suppose you're contemplating building this plant, no plant is there, so you build a plant there."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2239.325,2242.464,"Your Honor, we do not think that is going to be an issue in this case."
1980.79-1336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2242.464,2244.62,"No, that's hypothetical."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2244.62,2245.337,Right.
1980.79-1336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.337,2247.603,Obviously not an issue here.
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2247.603,2251.554,"No, we would not claim that at all."
1980.79-1336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.554,2255.522,"But once the service is available, it must be maintained?"
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2255.522,2256.131,Right.
1980.79-1336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.909,2267.236,"Well, what else... I'm not sure I follow."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2269.408,2277.404,"Well, we would suggest, Your Honor, that those state statutes do impose duties upon the Railroad."
1980.79-1336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.404,2299.207,"Well, certainly if you were dealing with an interurban service between two cities in Iowa or a public utility, the state would have the right to require the utility to extend its services to any willing customer under existing law, would it not?"
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2299.207,2299.473,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.473,2301.363,In the absence of congressional preemption.
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2301.363,2301.738,Right.
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.408,2501.61,"Mr. Blackburn, could I ask you a question about the negligence theory?"
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2501.61,2501.938,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.938,2517.807,Assume that the Railroad was losing money on this line and they went in before the ICC and got an abandonment on economic grounds that it's a loss operation and it's not necessary to maintain the public interest and the ICC gave permission.
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2521.025,2534.801,"Your Honor, we do not contend... and here is where the amicus and the railroad and we are in agreement... we disagree, we do not disagree with very much of what they said."
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.488,2540.892,"Your answer is, no, I take it?"
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2540.892,2541.955,"My answer is, no."
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.955,2545.485,"Well, if there's no duty in that case, they can willfully abandon."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2548.046,2559.588,Because the Interstate Commerce Commission Act does provide for provisions for abandonment and has language to the effect.
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.588,2560.682,"But I mean, as a matter of Iowa law."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2572.63,2581.486,"Well, we would suggest they could, but then they would subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the Iowa court if they carelessly abandoned."
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.908,2593.295,"But if they don't have a duty to refrain from willful abandonment, what is the nature of the duty to refrain from negligent abandonment?"
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2593.295,2601.869,"We would suggest, Your Honor, under... the duty arises under the statute that provides--"
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.869,2608.601,"Well, would they have a defense to your action if they filed an answer and said, we didn't do this negligently, we planned it five years ago."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2615.209,2621.049,"--No, I do not... I do not think that would isolate them from liability, if that's what your question is."
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2621.049,2626.219,"But you seem to acknowledge there'd be no cause of action if it were willful, but there is a cause of action if it's negligent."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2626.219,2627.781,"Well, maybe I misspoke myself, Your Honor."
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.264,2637.215,"My first question is, assume no negligence but merely a corporate plan, let's abandon this line because we're not making any money."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2639.481,2642.73,"--Oh, I'm sorry, I intended to say, yes, if that was the question."
1980.79-1336,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.73,2647.446,So then your claim does not really depend... your duty exists whether they were negligent or not?
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2647.446,2648.602,"Whether they were negligent or not, yes."
1980.79-1336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2648.602,2660.956,"At any rate, we have the decision of the final court in Iowa that passed on the question that in the circumstances of this case a damage action was permissible under state law."
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2669.28,2671.389,"Yes, Your Honor, that is true."
1980.79-1336,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.065,2744.392,"Mr. Blackburn, before you get to facts, are you going to talk about the Colorado case?"
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2745.157,2746.703,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1336,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.703,2747.718,Thank you.
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2747.718,2770.115,"We think those cases are all cases involving regulation and not remedy, and the amicus disparages our attempt to distinguish between the remedial effect as opposed to the regulatory effect of a regulatory scheme."
1980.79-1336,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2797.698,2801.228,"Well, wouldn't that remedy destroy the Colorado case?"
1980.79-1336,2,35455,m_gene_blackburn,,2801.228,2803.399,"Well, Your Honor--"
1980.79-1336,3,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,4086.714,4087.214,A very short one.
1980.79-1336,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4087.214,4088.932,You have one minute remaining.
1980.79-1336,3,17758,bruce_e_johnson,,4088.932,4092.041,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1336,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4146.082,4146.597,"Thank you, gentlemen."
