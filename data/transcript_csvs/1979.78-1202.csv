1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,4.09,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1202, Chiarella v. United States."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,45.143,47.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,148.847,152.98,"Well, you said no special relationship."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,175.893,187.197,"I would agree that there is a relationship between the author and the printer, who is an agent of his principal, the printer, but there the remedy would not be something which is analogous to section 10(b)."
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,191.367,195.113,"By this statute, but you said no special relationship."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,204.055,210.268,No special relationship between the seller of the stock in the open market and the printer.
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,289.411,293.277,"Incidentally, where does the concept ""insider"" come from?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,297.866,319.153,"No, the only rule that Congress has ever enacted, Justice Rehnquist, which deals with insiders, insofar as trading, is Rule 16(b), which mandates that an insider, which is defined in the statute as an officer or director or majority -- not majority, but control shareholder -- of a corporation is proscribed from trading, purchasing or selling, or selling or purchasing --"
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.153,324.322,Was your client charged with a violation of the rule under 16?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,324.322,325.296,"No, he was not."
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.209,333.484,"Well then, it really doesn't make much difference whether he's an insider or not, does it?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,333.484,333.756,"Well, as I think --"
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.756,335.407,The case law.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,335.407,337.885,The case law also --
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.885,338.835,From the Second Circuit.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,338.835,340.291,"From the Second Circuit, yes."
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.818,364.62,And Texas Gulf Sulphur is a Second Circuit case?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,364.62,367.326,"Yes, Your Honor, it is indeed a Second Circuit case."
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.856,372.496,In the Second Circuit?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,372.496,375.829,"In the Second Circuit, in that circuit alone."
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,607.039,612.017,"Well, his conduct certainly wasn't very appealing to a person of ordinary moral standards."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,613.726,621.46,"Well, not very appealing but that is most respectfully, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, hardly a standard to bring within a statute enacted by Congress."
1979.78-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,650.909,655.287,"In your opinion, was it criminal under state law?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,655.287,678.769,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, under New York state law I don't believe it was, but there are statutes in other states in this country which would seem to proscribe what is called industrial espionage, that is taking a secret of an employer and using it for your own benefit, and so possibly in some states it might be deemed criminal, but not in New York to my knowledge."
1979.78-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,678.769,684.801,You feel fairly certain about that in New York?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,684.801,687.151,"I don't know, but I believe so."
1979.78-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.166,801.778,"Mr. Arkin, why isn't the case apposite?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,807.58,813.944,"Well, because there there was conduct which was directed at the seller, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.78-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.713,822.436,You mean the trespass itself was a tort against the seller?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,822.436,844.365,"The trespass itself, and I suspect what would happen there in the English court is that in those days when trespass meant somewhat more than it may today, it felt that that was something which was a fundamental wrong to the buyer and so they imported or created for that particular case that kind of duty."
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,884.968,894.113,Suppose a judge trying a case in the trial court knows that economic consequences are going to have a great impact on the market.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,914.355,917.813,"No, I would suggest, Your Honor, it is not what this fellow did because --"
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,917.813,918.943,"No, I don't mean --"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,918.943,935.027,"No, no, not even abstracting, not even in principle because the individual in the hypothetical Your Honor gives, is somebody who in effect does something to the sellers or buyers of shares in the market."
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,942.178,956.142,"Well, I am assuming for the purposes of my question that what he does is the correct, not a corrupt decision but a correct decision, but he just takes advantage of the knowledge that he has acquired about the economic consequences."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,956.142,965.42,I would say a judge is a special person having a special relationship to the public as a whole not to make use of his judicial knowledge or decisions from his own --
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,965.42,967.25,How about his secretary?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,967.25,971.025,"I would say his secretary would stand in his shoes, but --"
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,971.025,972.853,The bailiff of the court?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,972.853,975.306,"It becomes more difficult, the more remote you become."
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1088.449,1095.872,"What did the government rely on, Mr. Arkin, to show that an instrumentality of interstate commerce had been used in this transaction?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1095.872,1097.164,The mail.
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.164,1098.828,That the offer was made by mail?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1098.828,1117.038,"Well, no, the fact that the confirmation slips of the particular -- the indictment lists 17 counts in the common ways of U.S. Attorneys in the Southern District, the number of counts was 17 based upon five interceptions of information and each one was a separate mailing."
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.038,1118.575,From Mr. Chiarella?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1118.769,1128.007,"Well, from the broker to Chiarella, that is the confirmation slip on the purchase of stock."
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1178.29,1187.829,"Well, hypothetically if he had been able to borrow enough money and borrowed a million dollars and bought a million dollars worth of stock, it might have an affect on the market, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1187.829,1189.514,"Not artificially, Your Honor."
1979.78-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1246.105,1255.906,"Mr. Arkin, supposing the tender offeror here had been the issuer, you could have an issuer wanting to buy up a block of its own stock, would your case be different?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1255.906,1258.177,That would be a Texas Gulf case.
1979.78-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1258.737,1259.081,"No, no."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1262.204,1263.473,He would be a tippee.
1979.78-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1273.982,1276.991,"The tippees there got it directly, didn't they, from the directors or officers?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1276.991,1278.999,"Yes, they got it from the issuing corporation."
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.999,1281.881,And this man got it through his job at the print shop.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1281.881,1284.605,But he got it from a source not the issuer.
1979.78-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1287.78,1299.42,"In other words, are you conceding -- let me be sure I don't lose this -- are you conceding that he would be liable if the client of the print shop had been the issuer?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1299.42,1307.029,"And he had purchased the issuer's share, I am conceding that under Texas Gulf Sulfur he would fit, yes, assuming he knew that the information came from the issuer."
1979.78-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1307.029,1315.964,But does the wrongfulness of his conduct or the language of the statute draw any distinction at all between the kind of customer of the print shop?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1317.811,1320.593,"No, the statute itself is a very broad and generic one."
1979.78-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1320.593,1321.47,I understand.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1321.47,1334.21,"It is much like the mail fraud statute, and it doesn't even say that he would be guilty in the hypothetical which Your Honor tenders, but that was engrafted on the law in Texas Gulf -- actually before, in Katy Roberts --"
1979.78-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1334.21,1342.688,"Well, are you conceding that Texas Gulf Sulfur wasn't in all respects properly decided?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1342.688,1345.138,"Oh, no, I'm going to deal with that right now."
1979.78-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1415.635,1419.921,"Who is the beneficiary of that, the entire investing public?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1419.921,1423.923,"The beneficiary of that, Your Honor, depending on what you are --"
1979.78-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1423.923,1425.189,I am talking about the Texas Gulf Sulfur rule.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1425.189,1441.412,"In Texas Gulf Sulfur, the beneficiaries there directly, the parties protected -- the parties protected are the selling shareholders who have the right to expect, have a confidence in the officers, directors of their corporation."
1979.78-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1441.412,1447.967,"So it is only the shareholders of the corporation of which the defendants are the insiders, is that it?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1447.967,1449.095,Yes.
1979.78-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.083,1483.26,Suppose one of the officers of the corporation seeking to make the tender offer individually for his own account went and bought up some of the stock ahead of time.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1483.26,1485.69,He would --
1979.78-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.69,1488.837,"If he made a profit, perhaps his own company could recover it."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1488.837,1489.439,Yes.
1979.78-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.439,1492.537,But how about the selling stockholder?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1492.537,1493.864,I would think that the selling --
1979.78-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.864,1497.517,And he fails to disclose to them that there is about to be a tender offer.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1497.517,1506.842,I would think the selling shareholder could recover on the ground that the selling shareholder could claim to be an injured party and that the officer of the issuing corporation --
1979.78-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.842,1514.809,And this would be true even though the tendering company itself may buy a limited amount of stock without disclosing anything?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1514.809,1517.256,"I think I missed your question, Your Honor."
1979.78-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.217,1527.117,The what?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1527.117,1527.811,Or the offeree.
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.819,1534.611,"I am talking about an officer of the company that is making the tender offer, the offeror."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1534.611,1536.824,The offeror.
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.824,1541.03,He knows about this pending offer --
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1541.03,1541.239,Yes.
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.239,1547.956,-- and he goes to some of the stockholders of the target company and he buys it up for his own account.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1549.967,1550.827,He has indeed.
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.059,1555.883,"Oh, no, they aren't his shareholders."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1555.883,1560.276,"The tender offeror -- excuse me, I am sorry, I was off on something else."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.023,1568.985,"Well, he wouldn't have any duty to disclose to them --"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1568.985,1569.453,No.
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.27,1572.693,"Yes, that is what I am asking."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1572.693,1573.893,He wouldn't --
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.893,1577.778,He wouldn't have a duty to the tender offerees' shareholders?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1577.778,1579.215,"No, he would not."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.215,1586.927,"Now, if he would not, I suppose you would argue a fortiori that this printer's employee wouldn't?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1586.927,1589.073,"Yes, I would argue that, certainly so."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.875,1600.582,"Well, have there been some cases like that on an officer of the offeror trading in the shares for his own account?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1600.582,1606.86,"Not to my knowledge, not in the shares of the offeree corporation."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.86,1613.412,And I suppose under the law the offering corporation itself may acquire some of the shares?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1613.412,1624.647,"Under the law, under the Williams Act, and before the tender offeror -- under the Williams Act, the tender offeror can now acquire up to five percent without making a disclosure under the Williams Act."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.647,1628.099,And that is not thought to be a fraud on anybody?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1628.099,1628.592,No.
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.062,1630.415,And how about before the Williams Act?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1630.415,1657.619,"In 1968, Judge Friendly, prior to the Williams Act being enacted, said that we know of no rule of law applicable at the time -- referring to prior to the Williams Act, which was about to be enacted -- that a purchaser of stock, who was not an insider or had no fiduciary relationship to a prospective seller, had any obligation to reveal circumstances that might raise a seller's demand. So that as of 1968, it was very clear that there was no such obligation."
1979.78-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.619,1682.635,"Yes, but under my brother White's question he is an insider of the offeror corporation, and he uses that inside information based on that inside information, i.e., of a forthcoming takeover attempt by his corporation, he goes to shareholders of the target corporation and buys their shares, and because of his inside information he has every reason to believe that the price of the shares is going to go up."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1682.635,1690.244,"That would undoubtedly be something which the offeror, tender offeror could claim against him in a suit for --"
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.244,1693.266,"Well, assume he could, but could the selling stockholders of the offeree also get to him?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1693.266,1694.798,"No, no way."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.115,1699.264,He is using inside information.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1699.264,1703.417,"Inside, not to the target corporation, not to the issuer."
1979.78-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.545,1724.965,"Your insider is my outsider, in other words."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1724.965,1727.558,Exactly right.
1979.78-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1727.558,1739.711,"I suppose if the printer had breached his contract and just decided to publish, he is printing but he decides he is just going to -- it would be a hot item to announce to the press, so he Just announces it."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1745.17,1769.59,"I think that is exactly right and I think a very fine hypothetical to teat is what we are presenting to this Court here, and the point is that had Vincent Chiarella, for example, say, gone to the target company and said let me sell you some information you would like to have, why, that would not have the violation clearly of section 10(c) it would have been some kind of contractual or perhaps conversion breach."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.59,1787.339,"The reason, of course, I suppose was it had not been in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, that would be -- but the thing that puzzles me a little bit, we seem to be coming to the conclusion that your client may have defrauded the customer of the printer, the tender offeror but not the person that he bought the stock from."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1796.247,1796.589,Because --
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.589,1803.11,Even though the defrauded party is a different party than the person from whom he bought the security.
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1803.11,1816.599,"Well, that is one of the themes off the Solicitor General and I suggest to you that in connection which means a fraud directed at the transaction, something which intended to visit injury upon the seller or purchaser of shares."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.828,1827.199,"Do you think all-- it may be that blue ship and all the rest, but in essence does it hold that the wrongdoer must defraud the other party to a transaction?"
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1832.782,1849.765,"There are 10(b) cases which may, depending on the standing issue, come up with somewhat different way, but basically all of the cases involved have to do with imposing a sanction upon somebody who is directing his fraud, his misconduct toward the purchase or buyer of shares"
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1849.765,1864.92,"What about (c), subparagraph (c), which reads ""to engage in any act, practice which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person."""
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1876.091,1879.336,"Yes, but his conduct was not directed at the seller in this particular case."
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.336,1883.845,Is there anything in that language that says it must be directed at the seller?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1883.845,1890.831,"Well, this Court, if you will, in Blue Chips seemed to suggest that very strongly, adopting the Burnbaum rule out of the Second Circuit."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.778,1924.612,But isn't that argument you Just made applicable to the arguments that the Solicitor General has made that are different from those made below?
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1924.612,1931.813,"Yes, I think that the fact that different arguments have been made and rejected by the government at various levels certainly does go to that point, yes."
1979.78-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.95,1953.433,"Their evidence -- I hate to go over time this way, but their evidence on this point was confined to the people who had bought the -- rather, who had sold the stock to Chiarella."
1979.78-1202,0,40928,stanley_s_arkin,,1955.889,1957.136,"Yes, they did."
1979.78-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1967.762,1969.711,Very well.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1979.994,1982.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.912,2051.271,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I just throw one question at you that you could handle before you get -- suppose that -- one can argue that it was the seller who was defrauded or one can argue that it was the tender offeror who was defrauded, either way."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2065.554,2076.179,The SEC's dissent decrees in this area have made the restitution first to the public investors and if they can't be identified then to the tender offerors whose information has been converted.
1979.78-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2078.04,2086.822,"But assuming there has got to be a choice, you say the investor would get it even though the tender offerors could have made precisely the same transaction with the investor?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2086.822,2088.577,Well the tender offeror is --
1979.78-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.577,2098.505,"He could have separately -- say he doesn't have up to 5 percent, he could have gone to the sellers and said I will buy this amount of stock at this very same price that this person does."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2098.505,2102.251,"That case is not only a distinguishable one, it is antithetical in our view."
1979.78-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.304,2114.746,The information he is about to make a tender offer isn't publicly available.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2114.746,2120.726,"That is internally generated information, gotten through bona fide business activity, It is not stolen information."
1979.78-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2120.726,2123.654,It is the epitome of inside information.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2123.654,2134.387,"But inside information in the cases that have come up thus far can't be misused in situations where it has been misappropriated, where there is conversion or theft or misappropriation."
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.452,2150.326,"Well, inside information has to be fitted in with some portion of rule 10(b)(5), doesn't it, which doesn't say anything about inside information?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2150.326,2150.976,That's correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.749,2178.218,"Well, the issue here I suppose ultimately is was there a duty to disclose."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2178.218,2180.105,There was a duty to disclose here --
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2180.105,2180.879,"That is the issue, isn't it?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2180.879,2184.815,It is indeed -- to the tender offerors and to the public investors.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2189.716,2192.882,Wasn't there also a duty to disclose to the tender offeror?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2194.993,2195.387,Precisely.Precisely.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2195.387,2196.882,Yes.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2196.882,2201.65,It was a double failure to disclose in connection with a securities transaction.
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2289.321,2295.185,Now to whom was this duty to disclose owed as you are now positing it?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2297.904,2302.389,The first duty that we deal with is the duty owed to the tender offerors.
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.452,2309.591,Disclose what?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2309.591,2315.698,Disclose that he was about to deal on his own behalf or in his own interest with their confidential property.
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.698,2317.222,That he was about to misappropriate this information?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2317.222,2318.807,That he was about to misappropriate it.
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.343,2331.068,Not that he was about to purchase shares on the New York Stock Exchange?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2331.068,2336.651,He had to disclose that he was about to use their information to purchase shapes on the New York Stock Exchange.
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.651,2337.47,That is all.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2337.47,2343.832,That is the omission and it is conceded that he made no such disclosure to these tender offerors before converting their information --
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.832,2345.716,"He made no disclosure of any kind, did he?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2345.716,2348.813,NO disclosure of any kind.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2348.813,2353.598,"Just so I may be clear, your submission is he should have disclosed what?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2353.598,2364.222,He should have disclosed to the tender offerors that we are dealing with first that he was about to misappropriate confidential information entrusted to them to purchase stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2364.222,2369.385,And that -- there were two separate disclosures then -- and that he was going to use this confidential information --
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2369.385,2375.184,Both things had to be disclosed as a matter of agency law and as a matter of common law fraud.
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.184,2386.232,So then your basic submission is that the criminal provisions of the SEC make any violation of an agency principal relationship into a crime?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2386.232,2387.009,Not at all.
1979.78-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2439.527,2445.682,You think that criminal statutes should be more broadly construed than civil statutes?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2445.682,2461.717,"The statute should be given its literal interpretation, that is all we are contending for, that it reaches any fraudulent device used in connection with a securities transaction, not limited to particular kinds, not limited to transactions that injure particular categories of victims."
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.48,2474.072,"How about the officer of the tender offeror who uses his inside information to go out and trade on his own account, just like this printer did?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2474.072,2476.553,He violates section 10(b).
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2488.421,2498.22,Do you think in that case the seller of the stock from whom he buys could recover damages from him under 10(b)?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2498.22,2504.188,"Well, the question of who can recover in a private action is an unsettled area."
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2505.387,2507.038,I am not asking you how much.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2512.824,2515.216,There has been a breach of legal duty to that seller.
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2516.27,2517.216,Under 10(b)?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2517.216,2518.744,"Yes, that is correct."
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2519.017,2520.692,Because there is a duty to disclose?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2520.692,2521.81,There is a duty to disclose --
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2521.81,2523.419,Where do you get that out of 10(b)?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2523.419,2531.087,"Whenever misappropriated information is used in the stock market and it is material and non-public, there is a duty to disclose."
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2533.127,2536.16,Why does it have to be misappropriated?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2536.16,2536.278,Well --
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2536.278,2537.533,What if it is just confidential?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2537.533,2550.098,"If it is information, non-public market information generated through bona fide business activity, with no element of misappropriation, none of the case law yet has held that that brings you into the area of fraud."
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2551.294,2564.674,"What if this printer had gone out and just told everybody what he knew, he didn't go out and misappropriate it in the sense that he profited by it, he just went out and blabbed it all over town and a lot of other people started buying shares."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2564.674,2570.471,"Well, telling the truth is not a violation of section 10(b) because it is not deceptive, it is not fraud --"
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2570.471,2573.447,But he did spread around confidential information.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2574.788,2575.67,No.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2575.858,2578.94,Even though he breached his contract and breached his fiduciary duty to his principal--
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2578.94,2579.625,That's correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2590.213,2592.862,Does he need to profit by it himself?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2592.862,2594.222,"No, he doesn't."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2606.761,2618.851,"Mr. Shapiro, may I ask this question Do you read the opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals as requiring some special relationship, fiduciary relationship?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2628.867,2635.021,The court does appear to adopt a rule of regular access to non-public information.
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2635.021,2636.189,But you don't go that far?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2636.189,2643.264,"We don't go that far, for the reasons that are discussed in the amicus curiae brief of the Securities Industry Association."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2663.006,2682.974,"What about the investment analyst that pays a visit to a corporation and obtains more current estimates of earnings for the year than are available generally, then that analyst advises his clients to buy, has he violated 10(b)(5)?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2682.974,2700.284,"Yes, the theory that has been applied in these cases is that the leaking of the confidential information to this individual is a misappropriation or a misuse of confidential corporate information that shouldn't be available for the personal use of anyone and that is a wrong to the company."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2704.808,2724.927,"You are saying that if a corporate executive gives any information to an analyst who visits him that isn't public, and it may arguably affect the influence of the stock and that information subsequently is used, that both the executive -- I guess he is a tipper and the investment adviser is a tippee is that the --"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2724.927,2734.877,"That is essentially correct, if the information is material, confidential information that hasn't been disclosed to the rest of the analysts and the rest of the investors in the market --"
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.877,2738.755,"Well, where do you get that out of either the statute or the rule?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2738.755,2745.824,"That has been the consistent interpretation of the SEC since the Katy Roberts case and every court that has considered it, every court of appeals --"
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.824,2749.024,We are talking about the Second Circuit now.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2749.024,2753.349,This Court approved that rule in the case of Foremost v. McKesson.
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2763.425,2772.023,"It sounds like misuse, misappropriation -- they seem to me to be quite loosely used the government here."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2772.023,2775.396,"It is a violation of legal duty, that is what we mean by misuse."
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.108,2785.313,How do you decide whether there is a legal duty or not?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2787.022,2795.902,"It is ultimately a question of federal law of whether there is a violation, but you look to state law to determine if there is a duty to make this -- to keep this information confidential."
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.902,2810.093,"Are you saying, in response to Mr. Justice Powell's question, therefore that whether there was a duty on the part of the corporate president not to disclose to the analyst would depend on the law of the fifty states?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2810.093,2812.916,"Well, the law in the fifty states is consistent on this point."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2831.167,2844.481,But the difficulty is that as a practical matter corporate executives wouldn't know whether information was material or not in a sense that a jury might perhaps decide.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2857.722,2869.398,"The courts have wrestled with this difficulty, and one of the safeguards against improper prosecution or improper civil damage Judgments is the scienta requirement."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2876.179,2882.944,I think the point made in this case by your colleague is that there is no proof of intent in this case to defraud.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2882.944,2897.161,"The District Court charged the jury that it couldn't convict unless it found engagement in a device to defraud knowingly, intentionally and willfully with realization that it was wrongful, with an understanding that this was wrongful conduct."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2897.161,2899.468,What was the device in this case?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2899.468,2910.846,"It was failure to disclose to the tender offerors (a), and (b) failure to disclose to public investors that stolen information was being used in transactions with them."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2910.846,2914.05,"I understand, of course, that there was a failure to disclose."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2928.553,2929.424,I have no doubt that the man --
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2929.424,2932.47,"I don't defend what this fellow did, but I --"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2932.47,2944.961,"I have no doubt that the man on the street would say that someone that steals information that is non-public and uses that to exploit a seller in the stock market is guilty of a cunning device, but this is not a new cunning device."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2944.961,2947.732,Haven't you got new independent grounds for this?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2947.732,2949.086,We do
1979.78-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.086,2951.863,Even if he didn't have legal duty to the seller --
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2951.863,2954.668,He had a duty to those tender offerors and that is a ground --
1979.78-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2954.668,2964.046,"And even if he breached no duty to the sellers, he did breach a duty to the offerors in connection with his purchase of the securities."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2964.046,2964.804,That's quite correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.804,2967.018,And that is as far as you need to go?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2967.018,2975.234,"Well, we agree that the Court could affirm on that narrow ground, that is correct, but we also think that --"
1979.78-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2975.234,2978.497,Don't they usually try to affirm on the narrowest ground possible?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2978.497,2988.522,"Well, that is a possibility but we think that both of these theories are integrally related and that they both have a clear basis in prior law and we would --"
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2988.522,3005.387,"I know, but if you include the latter and say -- if you say you had to have a breach of duty to the seller, you have some -- it seems to me you have some problem about permitting the corporation itself to purchase shares without disclosure of the facts."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3015.646,3016.547,That's quite true.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3017.129,3018.759,And there was no breach of duty.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3018.759,3023.282,That is because there was no embezzlement or conversion in obtaining that information.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3023.282,3026.175,That is just restating your conclusion.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3026.175,3031.805,"Well, the information is generated within the corporation through honest methods."
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3034.65,3039.034,"I know, but there is no -- I am talking about the duty to the seller."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3043.549,3056.143,"That's correct, and at common law there wasn't a duty to disclose when information was gotten honestly and that is the principle we rely on here, and that has been the principle that the SEC and the courts have used under section 10(b)."
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.807,3090.962,"Mr. Shapiro, excuse me for interrupting but all of these cases are civil cases, how many criminal prosecutions have there been under 10(b)(5)?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3090.962,3093.159,We have collected some of them in a footnote.
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.159,3095.399,How many prior to this case?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3095.399,3098.836,"Criminal cases, I would say the number is between 20 and 30."
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.822,3104.632,Have they been prosecuted to a conclusion?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3104.632,3107.376,A number of them have which we have cited in our brief.
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.376,3108.182,With convictions?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3108.182,3109.824,"With convictions, with Appellate Court opinions."
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.824,3111.091,Under 10(b)(5)?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3111.091,3112.198,That's correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3112.198,3114.021,Do you remember where they are cited?
1979.78-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3114.872,3119.301,It is indeed a footnote in our brief.
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.301,3127.607,I was under the impression that a dissenting judge on the Court of Appeals said that there never had been a criminal prosecution under 10(b)(5).
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3128.614,3136.507,What he had in mind is that there has never been a criminal prosecution for misuse of inside information.
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3145.886,3147.901,But never a criminal case like this?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3147.901,3151.695,"Well, there is one case that has some similarity to this that we have cited."
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.931,3188.769,Judge Meskill said we have been cited no case in which criminal liability that 10(b) nondisclosure has been imposed on any purchaser of stock either inside or outside.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3188.769,3191.399,"Well, that case was not cited in the Second Circuit."
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3198.818,3207.518,Just before you leave your point of fraud of the customer --
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3207.518,3209.254,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3209.254,3234.956,One can agree readily with you that it was a breach of some sort of a fiduciary duty for him not to disclose to the customer corporation that he had acquired this information as an employee of the printers but how freely translatable is a breach of a fiduciary duty into something that is fraud or deception or misrepresentation?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3234.956,3242.09,That is an important question after this Court's Green decision because it has to be nondisclosure as opposed to simply unfairness --
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3242.09,3245.569,There has to be reliance to the detriment --
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3245.569,3245.793,No reliance --
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3245.793,3247.166,-- of the non-disclose.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3247.166,3253.351,"If I may say, in a government enforcement proceeding, there is no requirement of proof of injury to a private person, simply --"
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3253.351,3261.375,But fraud means misrepresentation upon which there is reliance to the detriment of the person to whom the misrepresentation has been made.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3261.375,3265.446,The definition is suppression of the truth to take advantage of another person.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3279.267,3280.556,"Fiduciary duty, a fiduciary duty."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3280.556,3281.914,A fiduciary duty.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3281.914,3290.174,And how is breach of a fiduciary duty so freely translatable into a misrepresentation or deception or fraud?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3290.174,3297.176,"Well, as the Court in the Green case pointed out, if there is a duty to disclose and a failure to disclose, that is a fraud."
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.885,3312.726,"That could follow as between strangers, but it might not carry over where you are talking about a breach of a fiduciary duty, which is a stricter standard."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3312.726,3321.66,"Well, if the fiduciary duty requires disclosure and there is non-disclosure and it is in connection with a securities transaction, that is 10(b)(5) fraud."
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.66,3323.688,But I don't see that follows necessarily.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3327.606,3339.862,"That is what this Court held in the Capital Gains case and it held that in Affiliated Ute, when there is a fiduciary duty to make disclosure and there was a failure, a complete silence on the part of the defendant, that was a deceptive device."
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3339.862,3348.728,"Now, Mr. Shapiro, what if the fiduciary duty had been obeyed here and there had been a disclosure?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3348.728,3349.993,To the tender offerors.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3349.993,3351.651,To the tender offerors.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3355.423,3360.685,"Well, in that case you would have to address the question of whether failure to disclose is on the sellers."
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3360.685,3365.289,"Presumably it wouldn't thereby be public knowledge, would it?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3365.289,3366.046,That's correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3371.901,3373.398,Why would it have been a fraud?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3375.091,3380.656,"Well, in a government enforcement proceeding it isn't necessary to show that there is a private loss, but the --"
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3380.656,3385.66,"Well, that is the definition of fraud though, common law definition, it has to be detriment, doesn't it?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3385.66,3394.068,"Well, this Court held in Capital Gains that there doesn't have to be proof of private loss in the government enforcement proceeding, and the lower courts have all held that under section 10(b)."
1979.78-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.92,3408.482,But somebody else has got to be involved.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3412.964,3428.054,"Well, there have been prosecutions in cases very similar to that where a false prospective may be misdelivered and that it causes no harm to anyone, but the convictions are sustained uniformly because there has been deceptive conduct in connection with a stock transaction."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3438.143,3441.415,"Mr. Shapiro, I have not read the instructions to the jury."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3452.255,3455.858,It was tried throughout on two theories.
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3470.142,3471.209,Without limitation.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3475.498,3491.92,"Well, the defendant moved for dismissal of the indictment and the District Court held that both kinds of fraud were encompassed by this language in the indictment and that it could be a fraud both on the tender offerors and a fraud on the sellers, and that is how the case was argued to the jury."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3509.449,3512.113,The Second Circuit certainly didn't rely on that theory at all.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3512.113,3518.488,"The Second Circuit relied principally on fraud on the sellers, although it affirmed on this alternative ground as well."
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.477,3529.125,Could the jury have decided it on either ground or was the jury required to find that there was fraud on both the offerors --
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3529.125,3534.933,"The jury could find on either ground, that's correct, that is how the case was argued."
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3567.331,3571.895,"Mr. Shapiro, let me ask you just one more."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3578.499,3593.38,"Well, I wouldn't concede that because the tender offerors did purchase securities, and if in fact they could prove injury in connection with those securities in their capacity as purchasers, they would have standing to sue under Blue Chip --"
1979.78-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3593.38,3603.249,"Say they had engaged in no purchase transactions just because there was a breach of duty to them, they could not recover damages just out of these five transactions."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3603.249,3610.372,"That's correct, if they were not purchasers, defrauded as purchasers they wouldn't have standing to sue under Blue Chip."
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3640.258,3644.196,"Mr. Shapiro, I am going to have to go back a minute."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3652.926,3653.694,That's correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3653.694,3655.399,So you do have to find both elements?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3658.498,3659.621,That's correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3659.621,3661.8,So there really aren't two independent grounds.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3661.8,3662.021,There is --
1979.78-1202,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3662.021,3677.373,"You wouldn't say a fellow who is eavesdropping at lunch one day and heard some inside information and he wasn't connected with anybody, he just heard it and he went out and purchased on the market and made the same profit as this man did, he would not have violated 10(b)."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3677.373,3683.307,"Without some element of misappropriation of wrongfulness in receiving the information, that tippee isn't liable."
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3690.442,3696.867,So just a wrong to the sellers alone would not violate 10(b)?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3696.867,3700.491,Just using information without some --
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3700.491,3707.262,Just non-disclosure to the sellers wouldn't violate 10(b)?
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3707.262,3707.41,That's quite correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3707.41,3712.493,Unless you went on and showed that the information was wrongfully obtained and being wrongfully used.
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3712.493,3713.483,That's correct.
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3714.008,3721.898,"Mr. Shapiro, your argument as I understand it turns on there being a relationship, however one might describe it."
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3768.64,3778.001,"Well, our position is that stolen, embezzled or converted information can't be used in the stock market under any circumstances."
1979.78-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3819.754,3836.155,"But the cleaning woman who was smart enough to understand the situation, who didn't work for the law firm but who did pick up not just one piece of paper but who picked up drafts of prospectuses of tender offers, what category would she fall in?"
1979.78-1202,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3836.155,3840.701,"I would say that that situation, you would have theft rather than embezzlement."
1979.78-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3862.718,3863.371,"Thank you, gentlemen."
