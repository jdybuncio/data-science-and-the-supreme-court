1962.133,0,21523,david_i_shapiro,,36.022,39.334,May it please the Court.
1962.133,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.584,152.029,He was a civilian employee?
1962.133,0,21523,david_i_shapiro,,152.029,152.912,Yes sir he was.
1962.133,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,152.912,154.66,"Although he had been in military, it's in the Air Force?"
1962.133,0,21523,david_i_shapiro,,154.66,155.46,That's correct.
1962.133,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,155.46,156.219,In military.
1962.133,0,21523,david_i_shapiro,,156.219,157.307,Yes.
1962.133,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.214,296.316,To who is which -- who is the third?
1962.133,0,21523,david_i_shapiro,,299.265,302.539,The third one apparently was an individual who was present there.
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1064.075,1068.601,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.133,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1178.249,1184.995,"Well, may be I'm confused, wasn't the request made to the production of these witnesses?"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1184.995,1220.149,"At the proceedings before the Civil Service Commission, the proceedings on appeal Mr. Justice Harlan at page 44 of the record, the attorney, the counsel for Mr. Williams asked the Air Force or one of the Air Force representatives at that proceeding, Mrs. Dillon, a personnel officer whether three named airmen were available for attendance at the hearing as witnesses and if so, why they had not been brought."
1962.133,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1253.155,1254.77,And that's all there is --
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1254.77,1255.179,That's all there is.
1962.133,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1255.179,1255.976,-- in the record?
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1255.976,1257.705,"In our judgment, yes."
1962.133,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1317.723,1330.531,"Well, is the government's position that if they requested the names and he wanted these witnesses to testify on cross-examination purposes it would – should have been granted, is that it?"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1330.531,1345.317,"It is the government's position that he asked these witnesses to appear in accordance with the Air Force policy, the Air Force would've permitted and in fact assisted the witness to appear."
1962.133,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1409.311,1415.967,"Mr. Pollak, what is [Inaudible]"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1415.967,1419.355,"Well, might I respond to that in two ways."
1962.133,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1528.244,1541.312,[Inaudible]
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1541.312,1541.663,If --
1962.133,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1541.663,1550.619,[Inaudible]
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1550.619,1551.466,No.
1962.133,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1634.175,1656.84,"(Voice Overlap) I must confess I didn't think there's [Inaudible] can I just sum up the word, what is the government's position, is it that -- is there any premise that he was entitled to have confrontation here or is it the government's position that he's not?"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1656.84,1680.975,It is the government's position that the regulations here afford cross-examination of witnesses to either party brings to the hearing and that had he asked these witnesses to appear and they appeared why certainly he is entitled to cross-examination.
1962.133,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1680.975,1696.07,But -- is it the government's position that he followed the regulation and had not been able to get them to appear that the government had no obligation to produce witnesses.
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1696.07,1701.274,I think they -- I'm not certain that the government would be here and let me state this case.
1962.133,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1720.061,1721.67,"No, I'm not thinking to that."
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1729.115,1729.779,"Yes, which stems --"
1962.133,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1729.779,1730.77,(Voice Overlap)
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1730.77,1732.323,-- which stems from the lack of a subpoena.
1962.133,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1732.323,1759.334,"Alright, now, what I'm trying to get to in this, if that had happened here, there's been a proper request whatever regulations provide and nevertheless although the Air Force to believe that let them come you said no, I won't come, would the government then decide that you nevertheless have proceeded and dismiss him as he was dismissed without producing?"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1759.334,1764.706,On the basis of the affidavits of men who refused to appear and who could not be ordered.
1962.133,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1764.706,1767.52,Yes.
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1767.52,1771.859,The regulation supports cross-examination of witnesses.
1962.133,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1786.175,1787.532,"Well, am I --"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1787.532,1789.744,We don't think that question is presented here.
1962.133,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1789.744,1813.473,"Well, am I to infer then from your answer that so far as the government's concern the only question before us is did he or did not apparently he did not this -- to have to ask for those witnesses as the regulation said that he might be and if it's the fact that he did not although he might have under the regulations that are set forth."
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1813.473,1814.491,That is our position.
1962.133,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.925,1835.831,I thought you also want us to believe that the [Inaudible]
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1835.831,1836.217,"That's right, sir."
1962.133,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.217,1848.576,And that the government presented these by affidavit [Inaudible]
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1848.576,1872.289,"Even though, that's right, that the government may present its case on affidavit and that he is not to direct his request to the government to present a live case but rather to bring the witnesses in and in accordance with the regulations which make this an informal proceeding where the rules of evidence are not strictly enforced where a verbatim transcript need not be necessary."
1962.133,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.54,1889.987,"And would you say that if he wants to look at the error, he should pass and arrange [Inaudible]"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1889.987,1891.405,"That is -- yes, the --"
1962.133,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1891.405,1892.453,[Inaudible]
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1892.453,1892.917,That's right.
1962.133,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.22,1951.256,"Did you ever had a perfect right for producing witnesses' affidavits and do not really find the man because [Inaudible] and it has the perfect right to give, to arrange the witnesses to this end where the employee [Inaudible]?"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1951.256,1959.333,"That I believe you've correctly stated what our position is, yes and here, he did not do so as we read this record."
1962.133,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.333,1965.838,"And the case, you say, isn't here when he tries to go [Inaudible]"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1965.838,1973.56,"The case that isn't here is where he tries to make his own arrangements and the witnesses themselves say, “No, we won't come --”"
1962.133,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.56,1974.054,Or the government --
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1974.054,1987.344,"Or the government obstructs it, yes, and we state that had he only tried, the Air Force regulations would have required the Air Force to permit them to come and to assist in their coming."
1962.133,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1987.344,1999.829,"But you're not -- you're saying number one, as I get it, that the regulations don't give this man a right to require the government to call a witness for his own case, if they don't want to call."
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1999.829,2000.703,That's right.
1962.133,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2000.703,2014.488,"And you a fortiori not arguing that if it chooses to hear the affidavits that they then can't say, “Well, since we haven't produced any witness, we don't have to produce these fellows to the cross-examination.”"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2016.288,2017.052,No.
1962.133,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2022.664,2027.713,"Well, I guess my question is rhetorical so it's late, [Inaudible]"
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2027.713,2032.597,I wanted to mention one other factor of proceeding.
1962.133,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2151.031,2156.148,[Inaudible]
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2156.148,2159.499,"We believe, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe he did."
1962.133,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2159.499,2160.895,I thought it was his counsel.
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2160.895,2161.465,Yes.
1962.133,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2161.465,2168.247,So far as the examiner could not go on there and that they were in the academy.
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2168.247,2171.749,"Mr. Chief Justice, counsel did make that -- take that position."
1962.133,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2171.749,2171.92,Yes.
1962.133,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2171.92,2176.596,"In our view, these witnesses were certainly available to this man."
1962.133,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2309.263,2311.727,Mr. Shapiro.
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2311.727,2320.399,I'd like to read from page 47 of the record if I may.
1962.133,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2408.928,2412.9,"Well, the trouble is this is ambiguous."
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2431.031,2431.604,"No, sir."
1962.133,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2431.604,2432.423,What is the fact?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2434.908,2439.978,"Yes sir, at the outset of the hearing right on page 44, the last sentence."
1962.133,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.747,2484.348,But it is perfect [Inaudible]?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2484.348,2486.304,"Yes sir, it was at the hearing itself."
1962.133,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.304,2489.69,That's another kind of your [Inaudible]?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2489.69,2491.713,"Yes sir, after the affidavits were read."
1962.133,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2491.713,2494.715,Did he ever try to contact the witnesses themselves?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2494.715,2495.068,No sir.
1962.133,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2538.737,2542.435,What was your point about not being able to get on the base?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2544.466,2545.543,I'm sorry sir.
1962.133,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2545.543,2547.693,What was your point about in not being able to get on the base?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2549.743,2550.685,"Yes sir, he was."
1962.133,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2594.893,2598.674,You two gentlemen seem to be and head on collision as I understand it.
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2610.986,2611.486,I hope so.
1962.133,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2611.486,2619.229,And you say on the contrary that there was a request made and you couldn't get him?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2619.229,2621.628,"That's what the record stated (Voice Overlap) Your Honor, that's the way you are --"
1962.133,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2621.628,2632.946,- (Voice Overlap) read the whole record it sounds off [Inaudible] to me because I can't imagine Mr. Pollak getting up in making the statement of that kind that he thought the record can be [Inaudible]
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2632.946,2674.76,"I think it's quite clear and I would also like to point to page 85 at the record where they explain their failure to produce them to the Civil Service Commission and it said here this witnesses at furnish warrant statements concerning Mr. William's behavior and it was considered unnecessary to bring them to the hearing, whether it was felt that any testimony they would give would be repetitious and it would've made William's case even worse."
1962.133,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2674.76,2680.811,"Well, it doesn't indicate here that Mr. Williams requested?"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2680.811,2704.238,"No sir but they point out there that the Air Force Academy and here is the important part, knowing the character and reputation of the airmen who were concerned in this matter, it is firmly believe that even had the officials of the academy deem it necessary for them to attend neither the counsel for Williams nor Mr. Williams could have discredited them upon cross-examination."
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2724.407,2735.671,"Mr. Pollak, can I ask you about Mr. Justice Harlan was correct here [Inaudible]"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2742.824,2756.466,We certainly take the position referring to page 85 which has been cited that there was no desire or intent on the part of any official of the Air Force Academy to preclude the witnesses from appearing.
1962.133,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2767.462,2767.903,"Well, Mr. Pollak --"
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2767.903,2769.655,For cross-examination?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2769.655,2771.81,"For cross-examination, yes Your Honor."
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2771.81,2774.727,And you believe they are obliged to do that?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2774.727,2782.76,I believe (Voice Overlap) -- under the Air Force regulation the Air Force would have been obliged to permit them to come and to carry out the policy.
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2782.76,2789.311,The Commission -- Commission would have been obliged to see that they got their report for the hearing?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2789.311,2792.069,The Civil Service Commission examiner?
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2792.069,2792.925,Yes.
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2792.925,2794.973,"Well, that --"
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2794.973,2803.788,"Well, I don't mean they could have compelled the Air Force but as an orderly proceeding against this man he would have been entitle to have -- to be there --"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2803.788,2804.837,I believe --
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2804.837,2806.676,-- for cross-examination of --
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2806.676,2817.012,I believe that if he had said at the hearing that we have attempted to make arrangements to have these witnesses attend and we have been unsuccessful with the Air Force at the commissioner (Voice Overlap) --
1962.133,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2817.012,2823.988,"Mr. Pollak, is that the key to your position that he would've had to approach those witnesses first --"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2823.988,2824.066,Yes sir.
1962.133,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2824.066,2840.91,"-- before he could make any request to the Air Force for assistance and as this record show and I don't because as I told you I haven't read it, if this record shows that there was a request to the Air Force it was a request without first going to the witnesses to ask them as they be."
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2840.91,2841.995,That is what the record show and you are --
1962.133,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2841.995,2843.367,And your position --
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2843.367,2846.591,I don't think we're at [Inaudible] on that (Voice Overlap) there was no request to the witnesses.
1962.133,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2846.591,2847.158,Alright.
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2849.243,2849.371,That's right.
1962.133,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2849.371,2857.596,"Now, your point -- your position as I understand that without a request for the witnesses first he has no case at all."
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2857.596,2872.628,"Our position is that we -- I would not -- I would like you to -- Court understand that had he made a request first to the Air Force Staff Judge Advocate and said, “We want you to assist us in getting these witnesses.”"
1962.133,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2888.752,2893.231,"Now, what do you think he did it by a way of request?"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2893.231,2904.079,"I think he came to the hearing and stated, “The witnesses aren't here, I expect you to produce the witnesses.”"

1962.133,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.579,2936.582,And hadn't you already said that that there wouldn't be a case if that have happened?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2936.582,2941.263,"Well, I certainly said that we think it would be very questionable whether the government would be here."
1962.133,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2941.263,2946.296,"Now, I am [Inaudible]"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2946.296,2952.493,"We -- the Air Force policy would have been to have the witnesses at the airway, had he made a request."
1962.133,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2952.493,2953.806,[Inaudible]
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2953.806,2955.041,"They are members of the airway, that's right."
1962.133,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2955.041,2961.514,"Or the witnesses have said [Inaudible], is that correct?"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2961.514,2963.088,"It could have done, yes."
1962.133,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2963.088,2972.542,"[Inaudible] some of our tax cases that goes within the government [Inaudible], I guess that's your argument though?"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2972.542,2986.395,"My argument really is I think as I hope I stated that had he ask to witnesses to come, have they not come, had he told the Air Force they weren't coming, the Air Force would've seen that they had come, that they would have come."
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2986.395,2993.386,"These two men that were at the air academy were really the complaining witnesses, were they not, against him?"
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2993.386,2997.044,"There was a third person that he didn't ask to come, there were three witnesses."
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2997.044,2998.695,All three of them?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,2998.695,3003.494,"And he asked for two of them to come, the third just -- he didn't make a request that the third would be here."
1962.133,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3003.494,3004.452,Was he there?
1962.133,2,21523,david_i_shapiro,,3004.452,3008.649,The third one was at the Oklahoma base which was somewhat more distant.
1962.133,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3012.502,3013.658,Where was this hearing?
