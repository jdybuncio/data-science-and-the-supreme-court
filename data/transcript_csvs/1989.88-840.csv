1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.762,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 88-840, Golden State Transit Corporation v. the City of Los Angeles."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,12.386,14.87,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.061,93.776,"Mr. Fasman, are you contending that merely because there was a Supremacy Clause violation you're entitled to recover under Section 1983?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,93.776,95.009,"No, we are not."
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.095,119.796,And so what... what federal law was it that protected this right that you say was denied to you?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,119.796,120.999,The National Labor Relations Act.
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,120.999,121.497,The National Labor law.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,121.497,121.81,Yes.
1989.88-840,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.423,165.262,"Well, Mr. Fasman, would you explain how a mere finding of preemption by the federal labor law satisfies the test?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,165.262,182.458,"Well, I think that in this case the mere finding of preemption rested upon the proposition that Congress specifically decreed that private parties shall have the right to engage in certain conduct; that is, collective bargaining and the use of economic weapons during a labor dispute."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.88,305.69,"In... in the Golden State case that we decided, was that a 1983 case?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,305.69,310.014,"Yes, this was pleaded under 1983 at the time."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,310.014,312.951,And what was the relief granted?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,312.951,314.467,The Court--
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.467,315.764,A judgment or an injunction?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,315.764,316.637,--A judgment.
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.948,321.775,Was there a prayer for an injunction?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,321.775,326.524,"There is a prayer for declaratory relief, injunctive relief and damages, yes."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.524,328.383,We just... we just ended up with a judgment?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,328.383,332.632,"Yes, that's right, and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.99,340.831,Was there any claim in that case that the preemption claim was not a proper subject for a 1983 case?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,340.831,344.456,--That did not come up the last time we argued the case.
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.456,345.081,It was not... it was not raised?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,345.081,346.126,"It was not raised, that's right."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,346.126,354.187,"But I suppose if it had been raised, there would be the same sort of an... would have been a same sort of an argument then as there is here."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,354.187,355.278,"Well, that's right."
1989.88-840,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,372.74,380.628,At any point in the proceedings has the city contested the award of the ancillary damages?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,380.628,381.596,Yes.
1989.88-840,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.529,396.121,"Well, I... I know it's not an issue before us here."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,407.289,419.363,"Well, the... the authority, Justice Kennedy, is... is basically the equitable authority that inheres in the Court to assure that injunctive relief is not... is not a hollow remedy or a nullity."
1989.88-840,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.327,432.404,And... and... and we have some authority to address--
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,432.404,434.48,"Yes, there is Supreme Court authority to that... to that effect."
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.078,544.982,"--That... that's not... that goes a little far, doesn't it?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,563.851,564.741,--That... that--
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.741,565.195,Isn't that right?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,565.195,566.209,--I do stand corrected.
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.584,566.927,Yeah.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,567.365,568.224,The private conduct.
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.909,578.173,"--Furthermore, the Fourteenth Amendment is directly applicable to the states."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,578.173,579.673,"Well, it is--"
1989.88-840,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.673,591.714,"It says no state shall deprive, and Congress has specific authority under that, under the... the fifth clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to pass legislation to enforce it."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,597.805,602.819,--I think... I think this may be a very nice juridical... juridical point.
1989.88-840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,661.624,676.149,"Mr. Fasman, maybe this really isn't a difference, but the rule you rely on that a preemption based on the Machinists analysis and so forth, you could really say that's a judge-made rule of law rather than the clear statutory directive as we have in most 1983 cases."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,677.726,683.069,I think the question in all Section 1983 cases goes back to the intent of the legislature.
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.521,727.644,Are you saying that our... our first opinion in Golden State three years ago decided this case?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,727.644,729.081,"I think, in essence, it did."
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.824,760.552,"Well, what... what is your response to the argument of Respondents that the National Labor Relations Act essentially creates rights in... in employees and employers enforceable against one another?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,760.552,774.843,"Well, the... the simple answer to that is that that is directly contrary to the interpretive approach that this Court has taken in Machinists and H. K. Porter in the whole second branch of the preemption... in the preemption doctrine."
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.614,805.41,"To put it more briefly, your response to that argument is that we decided otherwise in Golden State One."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,805.41,806.378,Golden State One--
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.378,807.33,Specifically what we decided--
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,807.33,807.83,--That's right.
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.08,815.359,--That you had an enforceable right not only against the... not only against the employees but also against the... the state.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,815.359,825.088,"And that's been accepted law at least since the '76 decision in the Machinists case, where the Court... where the Court first... first declared the second branch... second branch of the preemption doctrine."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.088,829.853,"On... on remand and in Golden State One, was there an injunction entered?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,829.853,835.694,The Court was prepared to enter an injunction giving us a franchise for four years.
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.694,836.944,But it didn't?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,836.944,841.692,"Well, we stayed... this... this case comes... comes before the Court on certification."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.957,843.645,"Oh, I see."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,843.645,853.033,--in... in the district court so that we could resolve this issue of compensatory damages or our right to compensatory damages before proceeding to other remedial issues.
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,853.033,870.025,"Of course, if there were an injunction ever entered, it certainly would have been based on the fact that... that this preemption, this so-called preemption right really entitled somebody to an injunction."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,870.025,880.488,"Well, not only... not only did the court... were the courts below willing to enter an injunction, but the city admitted that injunctive relief was appropriate here, thus admitting we have a cause of action--"
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.488,885.8,And I suppose that was based a lot on our decision in Golden State One?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,886.44,889.079,--I presume that it was directly based on that decision.
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.179,954.24,I don't know what we held in Golden State One if we didn't hold the opposite of that statement.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,954.24,959.708,"I don't think... I don't follow your... your point, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.708,960.957,I... I'm agreeing with you.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,962.846,963.892,I thought you were.
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.704,976.357,--I don't know what we held in Golden State One if we didn't hold that... that... that you don't need an express indication of congressional intent to create a right against the municipality.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,976.357,982.791,"The Ninth Circuit even went further by saying, based on its express language test, that the NLRA, and I quote again,"
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.524,998.316,"It may be that you... that... that the NLRA created a right to be free from this kind of regulation, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have a right for damages... to damages."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,998.316,1005.408,"I think under the standard accepted test that the courts applied in Section 1983 cases, we fall clearly within it."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.408,1014.42,"I suppose you could say that Congress may have intended an injunction but didn't intend any right to damages, just because the city was doing what it shouldn't have done."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1014.42,1046.501,"Well, that... that may be, but I think the... I think our essential point is that that would be a very unusual result if we have rights, privileges or immunities, and I think under the Court's traditional standards we do, the proposition that we're entitled only to injunctive relief would be extraordinarily unusual because Congress created a broad damage remedy that allows citizens deprived of rights, privileges and... and immunities guaranteed under federal law to sue for damages in the federal courts, and that's precisely our claim in this case."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.501,1049.359,"Of course, there's no express preemption in... in NLRA."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1049.359,1050.874,No.
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.874,1055.965,This is a... this is a court interpretation of what Congress intended.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1055.965,1059.355,That's... that's... that's absolutely right.
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.355,1069.1,"And you could say, I suppose, that this, all they really intended to do was to protect federal power, and injunction is enough."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1069.1,1071.099,"Well, Justice White--"
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.099,1088.186,"If you want to... if we've... if we've fashioned this preemption notion when it's... when it... even though a statute is silent, I suppose we still have an unresolved question of whether... whether damages are... are permissible."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1088.186,1098.23,"--Well, Justice White, it seems... it seems to me that the premise of your... of your argument is that there is no statutory basis for the Machinists doctrine, and that's just not right."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.711,1104.804,You mean that's just for preemption?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1104.804,1106.273,"Yes, for preemption."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.273,1107.615,"All right, that's fine."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1116.675,1116.971,Well--
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.971,1118.05,In addition to an injunction.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1118.05,1125.515,"--And the answer to that is it depends on whether what they have done contravenes rights, privileges or immunities granted to us."
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.202,1127.858,"Well, not necessarily."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1132.419,1143.257,"--Well, but the point is that if we have a right, privilege or immunity that's enforceable otherwise under Section 1983, we're entitled to damages for the infringement of that right."
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.875,1183.993,"Well, if you're right, Mr. Fasman, then although you said earlier in your argument that violation of the Supremacy Clause is not enough to recover damages under Section 1983, can you think of any case that would not give you... where there was preemption that would not give you damages, any case where the Supremacy Clause was violated?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1183.993,1186.021,I think there... there are many.
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.549,1198.689,What... what would be an example?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1198.689,1239.406,"Well, for example, a... a broad regulatory scheme, a scheme... and you'll pardon me if I don't... if... if I don't get the... the precise area correctly, but if Congress, for example, says we're preempting the area of nuclear... transportation of nuclear waste and says... says not... not in an effort to grant rights and not in an effort to say a specific party shall have the specific right to do X, Y or Z but just says this is an area of federal concern and the state takes an action in there, in that area, that is preempted, that doesn't necessarily sound in damages because there's no right--"
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.406,1240.313,Who would sue?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1245.733,1248.544,"--Well, I presume that someone... someone who is--"
1989.88-840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.544,1249.169,Someone like us.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1249.169,1250.573,--Someone who is--
1989.88-840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.541,1253.76,Let me test that.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1256.837,1257.087,--Sure.
1989.88-840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.087,1266.66,"Supposing they did preempt the delivery of nuclear waste, and a state passed a law saying you can't drive through on... on state highways."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1301.772,1306.222,"Well, they might, and they might depending upon the nature of why Congress--"
1989.88-840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.222,1310.159,"It seems to me under your theory they always would, and why wouldn't they?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1319.796,1327.34,--I think the real question in that case is whether the law was passed for the especial benefit of the people who would transport--
1989.88-840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1327.34,1339.398,"For the special benefit of people who are in the business of hauling nuclear waste around, special benefit of... of them as... just have them regulated by federal authorities so that they wouldn't be overregulated but yet they'd be... there'd be protection."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1339.398,1355.188,"--Well, if it's... if that's a clear reading of the legislative history of the statute, for example, if... if there were history in the statute that says that the reason that Congress federalized the field was to protect the right to haul nuclear waste across city lines, sure."
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.575,1370.68,"Well, what... what if the legislative history simply said that we're preempting this area because we don't want a lot of conflicting state and local regulations?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1370.68,1373.274,That was the point that I was trying to make.
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.178,1380.584,Well--
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1380.584,1381.194,--and if it isn't--
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.194,1393.219,"--So what happens when... when the hypothetical truck driver in Justice Stevens' example drives through the suburbs in violation of the, you know, the ordinance of Orange County?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1393.219,1400.34,"--I think what you're entitled to is... is an injunction, but you don't fall under the terms of Section 1983."
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.34,1400.903,Why not?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1400.903,1404.965,Because the... the law was not passed for your especial benefit.
1989.88-840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.729,1409.869,"Well, there's nothing in 1983 about laws being passed for the special benefit of anybody."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1409.869,1417.632,"--Well, that's the test that... that's one of the tests that the Court traditionally has used to determine whether there is an enforceable right, privilege or immunity."
1989.88-840,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.632,1419.756,"But that's in private cause of action cases, not under--"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1419.756,1421.77,"No, I think in this... in this as well."
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.548,1429.891,--I thought it was the test we applied to determine whether you could get an injunction also.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1446.51,1451.398,"Well, you're raising... it seems to me that you're raising a standing question as opposed to... as opposed to this issue."
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.49,1466.174,I don't see why I would have a... a cause of action for an injunction and not have a cause of action for damages in... in... in any case.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1466.174,1467.315,--In any case.
1989.88-840,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.328,1474.982,The situations you've posited don't seem realistically to... to be that to me.
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1485.399,1487.743,"--I'm comfortable with that result, of course."
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.445,1499.645,"Well, but then you have to retreat something from your earlier statement that it's not every preemption case that is going to give you damages under Section 1983."
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1499.645,1516.7,"Well, I think I've tried as best I can to... to show how preemption cases under these... under this especial benefit test that the Court has used, where the proper... the proper inquiry is to look and see if a party is an especial beneficiary of the particular law."
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.7,1523.9,"When you're talking about the special benefit test, is that the Cort v. Ash test for a private cause of action?"
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1523.9,1532.725,"It's the first prong of Cort v. Ash, and this Court has held that the first prong is useful in determining whether a right enforceable under Section 1983 arises here."
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1534.194,1536.458,In the... in the City of Roanoke case?
1989.88-840,0,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,1536.458,1537.599,Yes.
1989.88-840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1593.106,1597.76,"Thank you, Mr. Fasman."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1600.635,1604.086,Honorable Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.88-840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.902,1638.057,But he... but do you say he is entitled to an injunction under 1983?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1638.057,1638.792,"No, I'm not."
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.043,1675.307,How... how could we give an injunction unless the individual has a right?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1690.739,1711.48,"Well, in order to enforce the holding of this Court in Golden State One, yes, because I... the... the type of analyses the court goes into in determining whether or not there is preemption is a different kind of analyses that the court has engaged in in the 1983 action."
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.48,1713.323,"Now, let's not talk about preemption."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1721.961,1722.335,That is correct.
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.335,1722.913,Rights.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1736.315,1746.372,"Well, the court in a... preemption analyses, as this Court did, did find that there was a right based on a preemption analyses."
1989.88-840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.658,1819.0,How did the plaintiff in Golden State One get into the federal court?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1821.53,1824.341,"Well, there was a whole series of cause of action."
1989.88-840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.2,1828.56,I'm not... I'm asking about jurisdiction.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1828.56,1832.321,"--Oh, they were claiming under 1331 that there was a--"
1989.88-840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.321,1834.399,"All right, and what's the basis for the cause of action?"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1838.007,1838.616,--Yes.
1989.88-840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.752,1862.919,"Well, do you think you could have... do you think you could have gotten... they could have gotten into the federal court without pleading 1983?"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1862.919,1868.558,"Well, yes, because... well, they also had pled violations of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1989.88-840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.558,1870.649,Why would that get them in... into federal court?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,1870.649,1878.678,The Federal Court of Appeals ruled that they had no cause of action under 14... the Fourteenth Amendment or under the anti... they also pled antitrust violations.
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.572,2043.471,"Do you think in any of those cases, if the Court had not found 1983 rights it could, nevertheless, have... have found the ability to gain an injunction on the part of the individual against the... against the grant agencies?"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2043.471,2044.782,"Well, there was no--"
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.782,2048.5,"Do you know any case where we've drawn that distinction, where we say you have a right?"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2064.931,2066.994,"--I know... I know of no case in this Court, no."
1989.88-840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.994,2072.225,That may be what this case is all about.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2072.225,2072.57,That's correct.
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.485,2202.891,"So, Golden State One was wrong."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2207.748,2208.217,--No.
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.755,2241.016,We didn't find in Golden State... in Golden State One that the employer had a right against the state not to be impeded in the way the state impeded it?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2241.016,2242.014,"Yes, the Court did find--"
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.014,2242.905,We did find... a right.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2242.905,2247.373,"--Yes, but I would say that is a right in a preemption... preemptive sense."
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.533,2431.719,He does have rights against a third party to get an injunction?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2431.719,2436.921,"--Again, based on the preemption analyses, that is correct."
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.921,2441.84,"Based on any analysis, what you just said is not true, insofar as an injunction is concerned."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2451.868,2452.899,"Well, what--"
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.899,2459.317,"Before we'll give him damages, it has to be really clear, but if it's just sort of clear we'll only give him an injunction."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2463.112,2473.312,"--Well, what I'm saying is that in order to secure rights within 1983, there should be some... again, the Court has always indicated it's a question of legislative intent."
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.012,2481.168,"Rights, not did he... did it intend to confer 1983 rights."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2499.927,2501.19,"--No, that's not my position."
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.513,2520.136,"But we found that, didn't we, that it does compel the city here to refrain from doing what it did?"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2520.136,2523.838,"--But again, it was not the express language of the statute as a right."
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.946,2528.727,Right.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2528.727,2530.241,--that the city had such an obligation.
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.241,2531.476,So it was not clear enough.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2537.349,2547.471,"That is what I'm saying because I think there's a distinction in the type of analyses and the purpose of preemption, as opposed to a 1983 cause of action."
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.471,2563.244,Would the case be any different if ten years ago Congress had taken a look at our Machinists preemption case and that line of cases and passed a statute saying we agree... we affirm the holding of the Supreme Court in... in the Machinists preemption case?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2566.181,2569.616,"Well, you mean if the Congress expressly stated that--"
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.616,2580.3,"Expressly stated we think that the... that the free play of economic forces is protected by the statute as interpreted in Machinists, and we hereby ratify and endorse the rule of Machinists."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2580.91,2599.464,"--No, it would not, I... I don't believe, because, again, in the Machinists case and as far as the National Labor Relations Act is concerned, its purpose is to promote industrial peace and define the relationship of the parties, labor, management and the board, in reference to each other."
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.697,2606.664,--But also and to prevent third-party interference with the bargaining process.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2606.664,2607.914,"--Well, the Act doesn't say that."
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.882,2610.6,In Machinists.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2616.394,2616.832,--Well--
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.832,2625.923,"--If the Act had specifically said everything we put in the Machinists opinion, if that had all been written out in advance instead of... would that make any difference?"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2625.923,2646.727,"--Well, again, I... it's a question whether or not they would say... well, I would tend to say yes, that... that probably would be the situation if... provided... if... if there was expressly stated and created some kind of obligation on the part of... of the city... if the statute said that, if the law said that."
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.727,2655.178,"See, but... but... but when the court interprets a hole in a statute like that, it's in effect saying, well, this is what Congress really meant and they just didn't articulate it clearly enough."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2655.178,2664.657,"No, but again, I... in making it... and I don't wish to repeat myself but I guess I'm sorry if I do, that I believe in a preemption analyses."
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.352,2696.646,"You're saying, I guess, that a law that... a federal statute that preempts state law does not give any individual the right not to have state laws enacted?"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2707.03,2709.218,"Well, or to prevent the state law from being--"
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.218,2711.295,Enforced or--
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2711.295,2711.701,--Enforced.
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.839,2719.183,"--Well, would it be--"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2719.183,2722.775,--which compels certain actions on the part of a governmental agency.
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.775,2733.037,--But would it be different if there were a federal statute that said no state legislature or municipality shall enact any legislation that interferes with the bargaining process?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2741.205,2747.281,"I think if there... if it's expressed in the statute, that's correct because, as 1983 says, we're talking about--"
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.281,2751.498,But then your distinction is not between preemption and other kind of laws.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2758.324,2767.695,"--Well, my distinction is whether or not the statute, looking at the express language or in the legislative intent, does create such a right in an individual."
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.682,2916.885,Mr. Haggerty--
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2916.885,2917.072,--Yes.
1989.88-840,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.072,2919.963,"--before you leave that, would you tell me again what is the that you propose?"
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,2924.039,2924.351,Yes.
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.822,3017.704,"Mr. Haggerty, that... that... that has some... some intuitive appeal, that test, when one thinks of the poor municipality that doesn't know that it's violating the federal law and... and, therefore, you shouldn't give it... subject it to damages unless it's clearly enough stated."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,3056.798,3061.234,"Well, the city knew at that point, but, of course, at that point they had already had done--"
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.234,3064.357,"Yeah, but... but what you're arguing now applies to all cities in the future."
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,3064.357,3064.904,--That's correct.
1989.88-840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.904,3073.869,You're saying no city in the future will ever have a cause of action under 1983 for violating what we said the law is in... in... in Golden State One.
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,3073.869,3074.885,"Yes, because that--"
1989.88-840,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3074.885,3076.026,Why does that make any sense?
1989.88-840,1,31051,john_haggerty,,3076.026,3094.767,"--Because, again, it's a question of whether or not the city has violated or acted in disregard of the law, and the law in this case does not command the city in any way to do what the Plaintiff is asserting it should do so as to get 1983 damages."
1989.88-840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.568,3241.879,"Thank you, Mr. Haggerty."
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3246.425,3249.751,"Just one or two points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-840,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3279.177,3294.296,"Mr. Fasman, isn't this case almost unique in <NLRA> [= NLRA] preemption cases that have been decided by this Court in that a municipal corporation or some governmental body was a defendant, as opposed to employer versus an employee?"
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3294.296,3301.261,"Well, the employer versus employee... branch of the preemption document deals with the... deals with a different issue."
1989.88-840,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3301.261,3309.165,"But even Machinists preemption, those cases prior to this one have almost always involved employee versus employer, haven't they?"
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3309.165,3310.071,That's exactly right.
1989.88-840,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3310.992,3312.569,So... so isn't my statement correct?
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3312.569,3313.757,--It is generally correct.
1989.88-840,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.366,3360.582,Could you have maintained your action under... in... in Golden State One without resorting to 1983?
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3362.611,3362.892,Certainly.
1989.88-840,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3362.892,3365.611,--just pled the National Labor Relations Act?
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3365.611,3368.859,We could have pled just a violation of the Supremacy Clause in a federal question.
1989.88-840,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.515,3380.51,"And... and... and would have had a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause or a... a cause of action under the labor law, or both?"
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3380.51,3386.445,There's a question as to whether you have an implied right of action under the... under the labor laws or under the Supremacy Clause as such.
1989.88-840,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3386.445,3391.428,"And... and if you hadn't have used 1983, would you have gone through the Cort v. Ash--"
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3391.428,3394.068,In an implied right of action?
1989.88-840,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3394.068,3394.505,--Yes.
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3394.505,3395.786,"I presume we would have, yes."
1989.88-840,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.252,3413.466,"Do you think that if, even though you might not have had a cause of action under Cort or whatever the formula is for implied causes of action, you nevertheless would have it under 1983?"
1989.88-840,2,46698,zachary_d_fasman,,3413.466,3415.153,--I think we have one under Cort as well.
1989.88-840,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3463.351,3465.976,"Thank you, Mr. Fasman."
