1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.26,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-688, The National Private Truck Council, Inc., v. The Oklahoma Tax Commission."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,40.858,45.732,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.701,133.107,"Mr. Allen, there are other consequences upholding that the State courts have to entertain section 1983 action in State court, and I'd like you to address in the course of your argument how you think this would play out, if you're right, that they have to entertain a 1983 action."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,149.649,156.455,"Justice O'Connor, there may be... there may well be other consequences to the conclusion that section 1983 applies."
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.878,162.248,I know.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,168.76,195.898,"--If a State has a procedure requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies in a tax case, which, by the way, Oklahoma does not, but if it did, this Court's previous decisions would indicate that in the 1983 action those exhaustion of administrative remedy requirements are... ordinarily cannot be enforced in the Federal procedure."
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.898,200.283,"Well, in the tax area that can be very troublesome, and there... something else occurs to me."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,227.959,230.302,"Not necessarily, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.234,257.819,"Well, you're coming in claiming the right to declaratory and/or injunctive relief... State, you can't get these taxes."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,263.422,269.188,"Well, let me simply repeat that that's not an issue in this case."
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.874,323.763,"And that's... you know, that's precisely what this Court has been careful to say the States don't have to do, that they can at least require people to pay their taxes and litigate later and follow certain claims procedures in doing so--"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,323.763,324.143,--Well--
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.143,339.023,"--and I think you have a strong argument, but it does seem to me that if you're right, and if no adjustments are appropriate here, that it would have a rather dramatic effect on established law in this area."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,339.023,360.117,"--Well, you raise a very pertinent question, but I think we have to be very careful here, because the point you just made was that the Court has been careful to preserve the right of States to... or at least the constitutional right of States, putting apart the requirements of any Federal statute, the constitutional rights of States to require people to pay their taxes before they litigate the ultimate question."
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.487,379.899,"Well, you file 1983, you get a preliminary injunction."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,379.899,380.42,"--Well, there's--"
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.42,383.071,"That's the way it works, and there you are."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,385.293,392.077,"--There's a very important distinction, I think, for these purposes, between a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction."
1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.437,418.584,What if a State had a requirement just like the Federal Government does now that there simply shall not be injunctions issued enjoining the collection of a tax.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,418.584,425.4,"I think in those cases, Mr. Chief Justice, the State scheme has to yield to the Federal remedy, and I think--"
1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.4,431.873,So the Federal remedy requires the States to do something that Congress has said the Federal Government can't be required to do.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,431.873,435.075,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor, but let me return to--"
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.075,438.747,Then what sense does that make in terms of the Tax Injunction Act?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,452.078,453.797,"--Well, I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.315,497.576,--Against whom?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,501.429,501.809,--No.
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.98,504.501,Who are you suing here?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,505.59,506.171,--The official.
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.171,510.075,Can you sue the official in his official capacity under 1983?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,510.075,512.304,"Yes, you can, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.304,512.565,Have we said that?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,512.565,512.876,"Yes, you have."
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,512.876,513.577,For an injunction--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,513.577,514.697,For an injunction--
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.697,515.707,--and declaratory relief.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,515.707,516.99,--For injunctive and declaratory relief.
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.99,517.378,Not for damages.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,517.378,518.32,That's exactly right.
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.019,532.008,Where have we said--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,532.008,533.651,That seems to me the logical and appropriate result.
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.651,536.952,--Where have we said that you may sue him under 1983 for an injunction?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,536.952,547.338,"In the Will v. Michigan State Police, footnote 10, is where you have distinguished... you reaffirmed the well-established distinction--"
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.338,549.391,"That's an old Eleventh Amendment rule, yes."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,564.479,569.484,"--Well, Will was a section 1983 case, and in that case, in footnote 10--"
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.484,573.478,Footnote 10 in Will is the only authority you have?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,573.478,589.806,"--Footnote 10 in Will I think clearly established that under section 1983... and really reaffirmed the distinction between prospective and damage relief, that under section 1983 one may obtain injunctive and declaratory relief against State official--"
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,589.806,590.066,"Well, let me ask you this."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,594.929,596.341,--That's true.
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,596.341,626.491,"And I assume, then, that it is possible that the notion that States can provide adequate postdeprivation remedies at law could be a principle that would enable the State court to say, we will deny equitable relief, because there's a plain, speedy remedy at law here, no equitable relief."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,628.512,632.225,"Well, I'm not sure I understand the question, if--"
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,632.225,653.047,"Well, if the remedy sought in the State court is essentially an equitable one, would it not be open to the State court to deny an injunction or declaratory relief on the grounds that we have in this State a plain, a speedy, an adequate remedy at law?"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,653.047,656.689,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, not under section 1983."
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.315,669.378,"Well, because that's obviously not a plain, adequate remedy if you can't vote without paying the tax."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,684.419,688.61,"--Well, I don't know why one would not."
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.61,695.295,"Because it's not... the State doesn't provide an adequate remedy when it says you can't vote, which is what would be the effect of that."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,695.295,704.11,"Well, I really don't... that may be true, but I really don't see the distinction between that and any other constitutional tax."
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,712.436,716.259,"Yes, but those, there's nothing at stake except the interest in not having to pay the amount of money."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,719.851,722.493,"Well, the right to engage in interstate commerce in the State of Oklahoma."
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.493,725.265,You mean you don't... you can't afford to engage and pay the tax on the assumption--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,725.265,734.231,"Well, you might decide... if you're Mr. Griffiths here, you might decide instead of operating in Oklahoma, I'm going to operate in Arkansas, where I don't have to pay this tax."
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,738.824,742.095,"--But it's a burden, in any case, it's a burden that can economically be redressed."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,749.782,773.748,"--Well, the question was, I believe the question was it is open to a State court who has determined that a tax is unconstitutional, is it open to that State court to say, you've still got to pay it and then go for your refund later, and I submit that under the scheme of section 1983 that's simply not open to the State court."
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,773.748,775.518,"Well, except that I suppose that isn't what the court would do."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,785.855,786.624,"Well, that's why--"
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,786.624,788.935,It wouldn't say you're going to win your case before it's heard it.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,788.935,798.302,--That's why I think it's important to understand and draw a careful distinction between a request for preliminary injunctive relief and a request for final injunctive relief.
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,834.206,839.138,"Yes, but that doesn't go... it seems to me... I agree with you, but that doesn't go to the point of the hypothetical."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,850.017,856.342,"--Well, you're not entitled to... you may not be entitled to preliminary relief, and I wouldn't dispute that."
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,876.213,883.748,"Sure, but if you win in this case, is the implication that the judge would have had to do something different at the preliminary stage?"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,883.748,884.038,--No.
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,884.038,885.48,And so you--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,885.48,885.991,My answer is no.
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,885.991,899.059,"--You agree that if, in fact, there is a postdeprivation remedy, even if the court is required to entertain at least some claim for relief under 1983, it would not have to provide a predeprivation remedy?"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,899.059,902.7,It would not have to provide a preliminary injunctive... injunction.
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.7,906.992,"Well, it wouldn't have to provide a remedy to your petitioner before your petitioner paid the tax."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,908.194,911.246,"I agree with part of that question, but let me try to explain my answer."
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,930.908,933.771,"But then he doesn't need it, because the Court said the tax is unconstitutional."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,933.771,946.108,"--He may not need it, and therefore we're really arguing about something that has no significant impact on the States, but I submit to you that if the tax collector nevertheless threatened a levy on his property, that he would be entitled under--"
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,946.108,947.25,But how could he... how could--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,947.25,947.55,--section 1983 to injunctive relief.
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,948.431,958.427,"--Mr. Allen, you just said the State court has said this tax is unconstitutional, and once the State court said that, how can any State tax collector go out and levy on the property?"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,958.427,961.169,"Most of them won't, but sometimes they will."
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.484,970.805,Well--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,970.805,972.745,--but I submit required by section 198--
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,972.745,984.145,"--yes, but Mr. Allen, the reality is the State court is going to want to say we're not going to litigate this to finality because there is a plain, speedy, adequate remedy at law."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,995.612,996.371,--I--
1994.94-688,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.371,1010.862,"--and it seems to me that faced with the notion that we have recognized an equitable defense, if you will, to injunctive or equitable relief, that that might be perfectly proper."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1010.862,1016.645,"--Well, I have to only respectfully submit that in some circumstances I don't think it would be."
1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.457,1037.651,I would think you would have no standing in that case.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1037.848,1048.436,Putting aside the standing question... a tax only on... I don't know--
1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.436,1049.127,Gray hair.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1049.127,1050.526,"--Gray-haired white men, right."
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1064.475,1077.715,"In this case, if all you were entitled to under some of the earlier suppositions was a future injunction, are your attorney's fees just limited to that?"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1077.715,1080.598,"I'm sorry, I'm not--"
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.598,1090.413,"Well, if there were adequate remedies under State law, and all you're saying is that you... your argument earlier was, at least you're entitled to a future injunction."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1090.413,1090.872,--Yes.
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1090.872,1095.176,Are your attorney's fees limited to just the value of obtaining the future injunction?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1095.176,1097.857,"Well, I don't know how you would value attorney's fees--"
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.857,1098.508,Neither do I.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1099.919,1106.353,--unless it's by the value of the... I think you're entitled... if you're entitled to any relief under section 1983 you're entitled to your reasonable attorney's fees.
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1106.353,1107.044,Once the State--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1112.668,1117.42,"Well, I don't know."
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1119.353,1126.457,Back up and explain to me how you would ever get injunctive relief once you've had complete adequate remedy at law.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1132.161,1147.39,"--Well, in this case, for example, and typically in many of these cases, you get a final judgment on the merits, and the judgment reads, tax commission shall refund, and furthermore we permanently enjoin the tax commission from enjoining the tax."
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1151.684,1154.366,We're talking about the judgment of a State court--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1154.366,1154.666,--Yes.
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1154.666,1156.076,--in a case like this.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1156.076,1156.376,Yes.
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1156.376,1159.408,"And if it makes the injunction, it would make it under what law?"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1159.408,1161.979,"Well, normally they don't specify."
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1170.574,1172.547,Is that... I didn't realize that was the case.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1180.962,1183.104,--Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.
1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1204.358,1215.845,"Well, the place where it makes a difference I think is between... is what has to happen between the time you first challenge the tax and the time there's an ultimate adjudication."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1228.353,1234.808,I think they can impose the normal requirements that are imposed on persons seeking preliminary injunctions.
1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.808,1239.852,"Well, can they impose a special rule on anybody who seeks to enjoin the collection of a tax?"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1239.852,1243.074,"No, I don't believe they can."
1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.189,1258.894,"Well, nobody knows when you start out whether it's a federally unconstitutional tax or not."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1266.408,1275.965,"--Well, if you seek a preliminary injunction, the court looks at whether there's irreparable injury and the degree of the likelihood of success and all the rest of those--"
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.965,1298.318,"And adequate legal remedies, and the point of the Chief Justice's question, I thought, at least to me, was why are you entitled to an injunction under normal, equitable principles, and why cannot we elaborate those equitable principles as a matter of Federal law in tax injunction suits under 1983?"
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1298.318,1306.286,"--Well, I think under normal, equitable principles, when you get to the point where there's been a final determination of unconstitutionality, under--"
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1306.286,1310.357,"Well, now, but the Chief Justice's question pertained to a preliminary injunction."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1310.357,1328.159,"--Under a preliminary... under a preliminary injunction, at the preliminary injunction stage, I don't think the... in my view, I don't think that States can say, as a blanket matter, when you're challenging a State tax as unconstitutional, as a blanket matter we're not going to issue preliminary injunctions."
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1365.392,1370.247,"But all of this turns, I take it, on there being no exhaustion requirement, which in essence this would be."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1374.968,1382.054,"When you say no exhaustion requirement, I'm not sure what you mean."
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1383.624,1404.338,"Well, as an adequate... I suppose you can look at an adequate remedy of law as being a base that has to be touched, and if there is an adequate remedy of law, you wouldn't be entitled to any injunctive relief unless that remedy for some peculiar reason is denied to you, and I took it that what you were arguing was, there's no exhaustion requirement in 1983."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1415.366,1419.247,"Well, I think--"
1994.94-688,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1419.247,1423.25,"If that is not your argument, then I guess I don't understand what your argument is based on."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1423.25,1442.383,"--Well, I think the question of whether or not States can require you to exhaust some administrative remedy is a somewhat different question here than the one we've been addressing, which is, what can States do when you seek a preliminary injunction in court, so maybe I'm not understanding your question correctly."
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.504,1461.034,May I ask you a more basic question for a moment?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1481.879,1482.21,--I don't think... no.
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1483.85,1484.661,--Why?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1485.743,1494.859,"Well, there are lots of cases that say that... Howlett v. Rose, for example, that says that States cannot refuse to enforce section 19--"
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.859,1499.62,They cannot interpose a sovereign immunity defense in a Federal case if they were not imposed in the State case.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1499.62,1500.01,--That's right.
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.01,1503.624,They didn't hold they must entertain 1983 cases ab initio.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1503.624,1511.709,"Well, that gets back to a very basic question of what the obligations of State courts are, and we submit that--"
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.709,1523.186,"There may be an obligation to enforce the substantive Federal constitutional right, but that's quite different from saying they must enforce the procedural remedy that Congress has provided for Federal courts in 1983."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1523.186,1530.73,"--Well, 1983 is what Congress has applied not only for Federal courts but also for State courts, and it's well-established that--"
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.73,1531.001,But wasn't--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1541.017,1541.849,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-688,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1548.164,1549.793,But that wasn't the history of 1983.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1558.83,1563.143,"Well, that may be true, but the Court has nevertheless held that State courts are--"
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1563.143,1564.433,State courts are--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1564.433,1566.464,--that it's as much law in the States as it is in the Federal court.
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.464,1569.576,--They may entertain 1983 cases.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1570.978,1582.714,"No, but you have held in many, many cases that Federal... that State courts have an obligation, a fundamental obligation to enforce an implied Federal law, that... you said in Howlett v. Rose for example--"
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.714,1583.135,Federal substantive law.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1583.135,1587.878,"--Federal substantive law, but section 1988 is certainly Federal substantive law."
1994.94-688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1589.13,1590.228,It's part of the 1983 remedy.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1590.228,1596.674,"--Yes, it's part of the Federal... it's an important part, I might add, but it's also... it is also substantive law."
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.438,1610.352,"Mr. Allen, I'm still struggling with some doubt as to whether you should be able to bring a 1983 action against an officer for injunction anyway."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1626.513,1630.995,"Well, certainly Will indicates that that's the case, and I think Will--"
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.995,1631.326,It more than indicates.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1631.817,1632.267,--Yes.
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.267,1648.739,"But it's dictum in the case, and the only reason it says it is because that's what we've held with respect to Eleventh Amendment law, but this is a statute, it's not the Eleventh Amendment, and it's certainly open to us to interpret the statute simply not to allow a 1983 suit against an officer acting in his official capacity."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1648.739,1652.981,"Well, that would undo... it seems to me that would undo an awful lot of section 1983 jurisprudence."
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.981,1653.211,That's what I wanted to ask you.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1656.584,1667.519,There are lots of instances outside the tax area where injunctive relief against a State officer acting in violation of the Constitution is essential.
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.519,1671.663,And would not be available otherwise than under 1983?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1671.663,1675.236,"Well, I don't know whether it would be available otherwise, but in--"
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.236,1676.236,You've certainly held otherwise here.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1676.236,1688.995,"--But in cases... I'm not sure whether it would or would not be available, but let's take a case where a State official is enforcing some blatantly racially discriminatory policy, and you want him to stop."
1994.94-688,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.518,1699.18,"Personally, certainly you could, but you're seeking an injunction against him in his official capacity."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1699.18,1714.1,"--Yes, even if he was acting in good faith and believed with some reason that what he was doing was constitutional, I think you can get an injunction against him under section 1988, and I think you can get attorney's fees under section 1988."
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1714.1,1717.953,Do you ask in the prayer for relief against the officer as a named officer?
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1717.953,1719.563,Yes.
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1719.563,1724.689,"Well, in your complaint on page 26 you ask for injunction against the Oklahoma Tax Commission."
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1739.829,1741.087,Well--
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.087,1742.909,--to come within the Ex Parte Young--
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1742.909,1749.092,--We did name the officers in the complaint and in the... in the style of the complaint--
1994.94-688,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.092,1749.973,--Not in the prayer for relief.
1994.94-688,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1749.973,1756.618,--and in the... and in the body of the complaint we named them all.
1994.94-688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.314,1779.662,"Thank you, Mr. Allen."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1781.996,1792.592,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-688,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.032,1936.194,"So here the taxpayer did comply with Oklahoma procedures, or at least in that respect."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1936.194,1965.395,"--That is true, and for the access to the courts under this, and this is title 68, section 226 of the Oklahoma statutes, under the action 226 which this was brought, there is no need, other than giving notice of intent and paying the taxes under protest within 30 days, that is the only exhaustion requirement that is necessary, that the Oklahoma courts have declared necessary."
1994.94-688,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1965.395,1968.447,This taxpayer complied with all of that?
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1968.447,1968.956,"Yes, they did."
1994.94-688,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1974.611,1987.549,"So your claim is limited to just saying, but no 1983 action will lie at all?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,1987.549,2028.134,"--The decision below, and it is our position in support of that decision, that where there is a plain, adequate remedy available under State law, and we submit that there is such a remedy under section 226, that although this Court has obviously said that State courts may entertain 1983 actions, we believe it is consistent with Congress' policy that the State courts need not exercise the jurisdiction, or to entertain a 1983 action to accomplish the exact same thing that they can accomplish under State law where in fact they can accomplish more."
1994.94-688,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2035.471,2035.641,"Yes, but--"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2035.641,2036.853,--Even if we--
1994.94-688,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2036.853,2046.149,"--But of course, if the petitioners are right, they get attorney's fees, and I guess attorney's fees would not be available under State law."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2046.149,2046.89,--That is correct.
1994.94-688,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2055.897,2078.11,"But you're looking at it from the point of view, as everyone is, of tax law, but forgetting tax law for the moment, isn't it normal that the 1983 remedy is treated as, if State law gives a plaintiff all the remedies that 1983 gives them but attorney's fees, still they recover attorney's fees under 1983?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2092.679,2126.072,"I certainly can't... as I... I will accept that because my expertise, if any there is with 1983, certainly doesn't go much beyond the tax area, but I accept that as a basic statement, but I believe that the difference is, and why not in this case, is because when Congress enacted 1983 and then they were aware, for instance, that in the tax area it was common that the only right that anyone had to challenge a State tax was in the nature of an action in, was to pay it and sue to recover it."
1994.94-688,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.292,2150.167,"Well, that, it seemed to me, which is a very strong argument, would argue for an exception to the no exhaustion principle."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2195.606,2215.301,"I think that the... probably the answer to that is, if we take that approach, and you say well, we will... we could extend 1983, it's application to State tax matters, but we'll change our interpretation so that there's no... that you can have an exhaustion remedy."
1994.94-688,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.659,2239.935,"Well, is there some reason it wasn't intended to apply in... for violations of the Commerce Clause, whereas it was intended to apply for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2252.885,2262.591,"If I understand the concern, I don't think that what we're talking about is creating an exception here, but recognizing that it never did apply in the first place."
1994.94-688,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2285.285,2288.838,But that assumed... that assumed that 1983 would apply.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2288.838,2292.121,"It could well assume that, but I--"
1994.94-688,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2292.121,2296.803,"Well, didn't it... I mean, wouldn't it have been pointless if it had not assumed that?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2296.803,2351.119,"--I think not, Your Honor, because in the times when the Tax Injunction Act was enacted, as I understand historically you had usually the situation where interstate businesses or taxpayers were challenging State tax laws, not on the basis of 1983, but usually seeking injunctions pending the litigation and often causing the States, because of their ability and the taxpayer's ability to either have to give up the case or to accept something less than what was owed, or else have their entire collecting mechanism, at least to that extent, disrupted during the litigation, and Congress perceived that as an evil, and I don't recall that 1983 remedies were involved in that, but they, in proceeding--"
1994.94-688,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.119,2358.012,I guess what's... I guess what I'm... what perplexes me is 1983 was not required to authorize the Federal courts to give those remedies.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2364.888,2380.359,"--Well, as I understand the historical basis of 1983, it was perceived that either there were no State law remedies, or they may have been on the books, but they were not being enforced, so that a Federal forum and a Federal remedy were provided."
1994.94-688,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2387.361,2388.423,Because of the way it's written.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2388.423,2434.962,"Because of the way it's written and the continuing situations that come before the courts, but I submit that it was never intended... and although it is very, very broadly worded, it is so broadly worded as to cover probably situations that I can't conceive of today, but I do not believe that considering the history and the knowledge, presumed knowledge of Congress when both 1983, the Ku Klux Act, was passed and also when the... years later when 1988 was added to it, I do not believe Congress ever supposed or intended, nor do I believe the wording goes or requires this Court to apply those remedies, the Federal remedies in State tax actions."
1994.94-688,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2434.962,2440.956,"Mr. Johnston, if you're right, then wasn't the end of the road in the Dennis case wrong?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2447.712,2449.893,"I believe that to be true, Your Honor."
1994.94-688,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2464.211,2468.014,"But consider... let's assume you're right about that, that it wasn't even considered."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2481.823,2487.637,"--If I understand the question, I believe, if they had considered the question that is present in this case--"
1994.94-688,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2487.637,2487.827,Yes.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2487.827,2499.665,"--that the State would have been justified in accepting, as the court below did, yes, we are now told, and we understand that the Commerce Clause will provide a basis for 1983 actions."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.326,2673.347,"May I ask you a question about, sort of the way the case developed?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2699.705,2701.117,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.377,2716.617,Right.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2716.617,2728.045,"--Where they cite jurisdiction, they cite that this Court has jurisdiction of this cation under 68 O.S. 1981 section 226, and title 12, 1651."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.515,2729.775,"Oh, I see."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2730.166,2738.03,"--is the Declaratory Judgments Act, and so they specifically invoked the court's jurisdiction to entertain this action under 226."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.03,2749.008,"And you're in effect saying that they pleaded in the alternative a State remedy and a Federal remedy, and it was within the power of the State court to say we'll grant the State relief and we just won't grant the other relief."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2749.008,2752.211,"Actually, I have a little bit sharper position than that."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.126,2771.442,"Well, it's their... their Count 3, when they... I mean, you're right about the jurisdictional provision, but when they get around to asking for relief they seem to rely... I thought they had relied, and I misread it, I see, on the Federal statute only."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2787.655,2792.095,--I believe that they would have a... I think they would have a problem.
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.095,2793.116,And they just never cited the refund procedures.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2793.116,2797.909,Because I don't think that basically would be available under 1983.
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2804.844,2811.25,"No, no, I'm saying they say the relief we want is, we're going to pay the taxes now, so you won't have the normal... we think that's a fair requirement."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2827.228,2839.366,"Well, I would submit that it's not that... what they're asking for in your scenario would not be provided for under Federal law, because they would be in a position of saying we want a refund under Federal law, but you're suing the State for the refund."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.089,2844.221,But we're doing it in State court.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2845.421,2848.884,"--We're doing it in State court, but if the only basis--"
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.884,2849.755,There's no Eleventh Amendment problem.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2849.755,2859.48,"--for a refund is 1983, it doesn't authorize one, at least according to the cases, because that in effect is a suit for refund against the State under 1983, and the State is a person."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2870.067,2870.986,"Well, why not?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2881.975,2888.461,"Because the language of the statute itself says that it has to be an action against a person, and the refund action is against the State."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.461,2892.571,You're asking us to reject the footnote that Justice Scalia was addressing himself to a little earlier.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2896.836,2897.196,Yes.
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.196,2897.975,--went to injunctive relief.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2897.975,2898.216,Yes.
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.216,2898.716,"Oh, I see."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2898.716,2908.213,"And so I was talking about if they say, we want a refund under Federal law, it's not there, because 1983 doesn't provide it because an action for refunds is against the State."
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2908.213,2910.083,"Yes, but... but so what?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2912.203,2919.269,"Because an action against the State for damages, for refunds, is not... has not been permitted under 1983."
1994.94-688,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.269,2920.531,--And that was the holding of Will.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2921.15,2921.921,I believe so.
1994.94-688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.921,2927.774,"--Not under... but that was an Eleventh Amendment case, wasn't it?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2927.774,2929.076,I am not aware--
1994.94-688,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2929.076,2930.105,Wasn't that an Eleventh Amendment--
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2930.105,2935.04,"--for any purpose that... and, of course, I don't think petitioner--"
1994.94-688,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2935.04,2939.612,--Your position is that our footnote in Will was not confined or controlled by the Eleventh Amendment.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2942.935,2951.79,"--I read it as simply for what it says, is that persons... and I read it for being... for purposes of 1983."
1994.94-688,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2951.79,2954.512,And a State is not a person.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2954.512,2972.844,"A State is not a person, and therefore I believe an action for damages in the nature of refunds I do not believe would be permissible under 1983, so my answer, I think, to your question is that they would not be successful if they just disregarded State law, because their only right to a refund is provided by State law."
1994.94-688,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2972.844,2980.539,"But they would have succeeded in one of their objectives, which was to get the State law declared unconstitutional."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,2980.539,2981.34,They would have.
1994.94-688,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.34,2995.759,"All right, so under normal 1983 law they would be a prevailing party entitled to attorney's fees, and the only way I guess you can avoid it is if the State has a right not to put 1983 in State court in tax matters."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,3015.443,3019.054,"Well, for one reason I don't believe that we need to take that position."
1994.94-688,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3043.51,3057.559,"Right, and is that just in tax cases, or is that also in a case where there is State laws of assault and battery and all kinds of other laws, and the person under the Fourteenth Amendment makes exactly the same claim for attorney's fees, and does this rule apply there, too?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,3057.559,3059.672,--I'm suggesting it is only in State tax--
1994.94-688,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3059.672,3065.546,"And the reason it's only... the only way, I guess... I'm not arguing with you as much as I'm trying to think it through, to tell you the truth."
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,3092.271,3104.659,"--That is the structure of the argument, and the argument is that both 19... 1983 and its attendant 1988 and section 1341, the Tax Injunction, of course they are both expressions of policy."
1994.94-688,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3178.317,3189.447,"But that seems to undermine, at least in part, the Dennis case, because isn't... if you're right about the bottom line in Dennis being no counsel fees, wasn't that kind of a Pyrrhic victory?"
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,3189.447,3216.572,"I suggest that the only question that was really presented in Dennis is whether or not the Commerce Clause granted rights and privileges which would be... a violation of which would be protected, or a remedy given under 1983, and I can envision, possibly, violations by State actors of the Commerce Clause in areas that have nothing to do with taxation."
1994.94-688,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3216.572,3218.796,But that case itself happened to be a tax case.
1994.94-688,1,41552,stanley_p_johnston,,3218.796,3220.796,That case itself is certainly a tax case.
1994.94-688,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3353.693,3355.675,"Thank you, Mr. Johnston."
