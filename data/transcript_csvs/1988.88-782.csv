1988.88-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.038,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-782, United States Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,11.1,15.351,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.647,264.892,"Mr. Wallace, as far as the inconvenience is concerned, though, the Respondents suggest that maybe that's the way you do it now, but it would be no great inconvenience to simply instruct each attorney in the field that when the court opinion is issued and he forwards a copy to wherever he now forwards it, another copy also be sent to some central repository where you would have all of them."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,270.364,292.971,"--By and large, these are received by clerical personnel... and they come in in the mall in the Department... whose job it is to identify the proper unit, the proper litigating unit, in the Tax Division, to whom to send the opinions."
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.917,360.287,Well--
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,360.287,362.991,--like any other lawyer to find out about recent developments.
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.991,374.177,"--Maybe you win under the statute, Mr. Wallace, but I don't think you're going to persuade me that it's a whole lot of trouble to... to set up some system that would have all these things in one place that they could be turned over without... without much difficultly."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,374.177,374.327,It--
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.327,375.667,Is that true or not?
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,383.945,384.105,--The Department xxx--
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.105,384.673,--or the lawyer who sends it--
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,384.673,387.956,--the lawyers are spread out over several buildings.
1988.88-782,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.883,415.155,--Is the point of all this that they are not agency records?
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,415.155,418.478,"Well, that is one of our two contentions."
1988.88-782,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,419.147,423.621,"Well, but I mean is... is that the point you're leading up to, or is this just background recitation?"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,425.672,453.05,"Well, it is the... the factual background of the case, and it has to do with contentions that are being made about why the statute should be interpreted so as to put requesters on an even playing field and that sort of thing, which we think are contentions that are overdrawn."
1988.88-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.816,461.167,"But, Mr. Wallace--"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,461.167,481.139,"--about the deeper costs that are involved by the cumulative burden of devoting personnel in... of course, in piecemeal fashion, and devoting reproducing facilities to tasks of this kind."
1988.88-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.715,492.929,"--Mr. Wallace, how... how many, on the average, opinions are... of the district courts are we talking about per year?"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,492.929,510.942,"The record shows that there are 20,000 tax cases per year, but it does not break that down into district court and other cases, nor does it show how many district court cases might result in numerous orders being issued."
1988.88-782,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,522.349,524.041,"Interim order, discovery orders?"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,524.893,536.22,"Well, any order that's issued is part of the log, and the request is for anything that appeared on the previous week's log."
1988.88-782,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,539.953,543.784,"Mr. Wallace, is that the only place where all of these opinions can be found?"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,543.784,545.106,--xxx.
1988.88-782,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,545.106,547.68,Doesn't the Library of Congress have the same thing?
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,547.68,552.212,"The Library of Congress, the issuing courts, of course."
1988.88-782,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,552.212,555.574,"I mean, but where all of them are in the same place."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,555.574,567.061,"The published ones all wind up being published in the Federal Supplement, and the loose-leaf services publish them in advance."
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.839,595.772,That's the only place they're available as soon as they are available in the Justice Department.
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,596.092,598.155,"Well, sooner really because--"
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.155,598.325,Sooner.
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,598.325,600.548,--there is transmittal time.
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.548,602.731,But you have to go around to each one of the courts.
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,607.674,615.299,That would be correct in... in the categories of litigation where the government is always a party.
1988.88-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.163,628.186,"Mr. Wallace, may I just ask you one other question about your burden argument?"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,640.866,666.852,"Well, of course, there is always some burden, but part of the burden of reading the Freedom of Information Act more expansively than Congress intended is that FOIA requests themselves that Congress intended to be honored will be delayed because the limited number of personnel dealing with FOIA requests will be distracted--"
1988.88-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.852,672.566,"Yes, but if the request is... is broader than Congress intended, we'd deny it even if there was no burden involved."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,672.566,673.848,"--Well, that is correct."
1988.88-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,673.848,677.491,I'm just wondering if there really is any legal merit to your burden argument.
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,677.491,682.504,We do not rest on it as a separate legal point.
1988.88-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.549,725.614,But does the... do the Respondents seek production or access to the ones that simply go to the U.S. attorneys' offices?
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,725.614,731.627,"Not in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, because the logs do not reflect that."
1988.88-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,731.627,740.122,"Mr. Wallace, what do you say an agency record is under FOIA as you understand it?"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,740.122,757.844,"Well, let me, as a preface to answering the question, say we do not think that this case requires the Court to adopt an all-encompassing definition that will cover every kind of case."
1988.88-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.153,870.031,"Well, how does it include probation reports that aren't generated or compiled by the agency, but nonetheless relied on in some sense?"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,873.113,873.764,"--Well, we--"
1988.88-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,873.764,876.559,Or pre-sentence reports.
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,876.559,881.771,--Pre-sentence reports were the ones given particular attention.
1988.88-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,889.816,891.747,"Well, we indicated they appeared to be agency records."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,891.747,891.907,--Yes.
1988.88-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,891.907,897.203,They were neither compiled by nor generated by the agency itself.
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,897.203,897.623,No.
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.605,964.899,Don't you think that description applies pretty well to a court order directed to the... or court judgment directed to the Department of Justice?
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,977.11,1006.728,"There is an analogy there, but it is... it is used only as a... the way any litigator would use the opinion or the way any lawyer would, to the extent it's used as a statement of what the law is for guidance in other cases, the same as a reported case in the Department of Justice's law library."
1988.88-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1158.37,1188.23,"Mr. Wallace, what if... what if the Tax Division relied... in some sense it at least reviewed and studied and considered a privately produced research report, let's say, by some private research organization that... from which the public could buy a copy of the report, but a member of the public wants to see the agency's copy."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1189.962,1192.024,It could be.
1988.88-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1221.718,1233.716,"But you wouldn't respond, I gather, that it's enough that the member of the public could go buy it for $500 at the research institute that produced it."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1233.716,1236.329,"Well, that is a consideration."
1988.88-782,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1249.908,1259.956,"Well, is that... is that the meaning of the statute in which it says that unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale?"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1261.728,1269.703,"--Well, we've never faced the question whether that has to be by the agency."
1988.88-782,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1269.703,1271.385,Do you have a position on that?
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1271.385,1281.452,"I can't say that I've consulted on that, that... that the face of the statute answers that particular problem."
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.454,1363.777,Because the statute says the one and it doesn't say the other.
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1365.788,1379.917,"--But it... well, there... it doesn't specifically say the other, but it does say that... that the Department can be ordered to produce only if it is improperly withheld materials."
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.917,1388.523,"Oh, and you think improperly means a general charge to look into it on the part of the courts to say what's improper and what isn't."
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1388.523,1389.103,"Well, the Court--"
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.103,1392.135,Beyond the exemptions that are specifically set forth.
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1392.135,1399.4,"--The Court held in GTE Sylvania, where no exemption was applicable, that it was not an improper withholding."
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.581,1482.109,"Is it fairly comparable that... to compare a case where you have a conflict between what the statute says and a... and a proper court order, the court saying one thing--"
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1482.109,1482.249,--Well--
1988.88-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.249,1483.02,--the statute the other?
1988.88-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1483.02,1504.364,"--It's not fully comparable, but there is an analogy which is strongly supported by the fact that even records generated by the Department themselves, if they're available in a reading room or promptly published or published in the Federal Register, are not subject to disclosure."
1988.88-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.271,1514.362,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1515.874,1520.396,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1564.246,1566.81,"We're talking roughly 1,000 a year."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1566.81,1567.0,Eighteen hundred.
1988.88-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.0,1568.082,Eighteen hundred a year.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1568.082,1573.666,I'd like to put this case in context.
1988.88-782,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1678.69,1680.391,Why do you say theoretically available?
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1682.183,1690.611,--Our experience has been that at least 25 percent of these orders are never obtained by any of the publishers.
1988.88-782,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1700.809,1702.522,"Well, maybe they're just a little lazy about it."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1704.575,1707.888,"Laziness is not the issue, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1988.88-782,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1707.888,1710.239,"Well, this is a commercial enterprise, and--"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1710.239,1714.511,"We... we happen to be a nonprofit enterprise, but others are commercial enterprises."
1988.88-782,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1722.777,1724.146,--I'd be--
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1724.146,1724.857,--xxx to the public.
1988.88-782,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1724.857,1726.567,--interested in knowing really what the difficulties are.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1726.567,1732.092,"Take, for example, the list is obtained by my client."
1988.88-782,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1781.072,1783.516,It's much easier to put the expense on the United States Government.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1783.516,1789.739,We are prepared... and I am authorized to say this.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.349,1809.414,"Of course, that's not the entire expense the Department undergoes in complying with your request."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1809.414,1810.533,"Well, Your... Your Honor--"
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.533,1811.114,Is it?
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1811.114,1812.366,--It is not.
1988.88-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.646,1876.902,"Well, there's always the expense of assembling and providing space and filing and all of that."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,1879.453,1880.665,"Well, there are two answers to that."
1988.88-782,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.43,2004.714,What is the statutory point that this bears on this?
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2012.077,2013.379,No.
1988.88-782,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2015.46,2016.031,"So, why are we talking about it?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2016.031,2040.848,"--Our position would not be different because Congress has said that for the reason that they discerned, which was that documents are not readily accessible, they refused to give the Department of Justice the specific relief it asked... asked for meaning, it seems to me, that the Freedom of Information Act, as understood by the Congress and at that time as understood by the Department of Justice--"
1988.88-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.848,2043.62,More properly understood by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2043.62,2047.744,"--Senate... right, as understood by the Senate Judiciary Committee."
1988.88-782,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.694,2072.931,"But even if the fact were that you could get these from district courts all over the country within, say, a five-day turnaround time, your position here would still be the same--"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2072.931,2074.772,Our position would be the same.
1988.88-782,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2074.772,2075.873,--that you're entitled to them from the Department of Justice.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2075.873,2078.628,"Our position would be the same, but we probably wouldn't be here at all."
1988.88-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2083.601,2104.174,"Mr. Dobrovir, suppose that all of the orders in tax cases were also sent to, let's say, the U.S. Tax Court here in Washington and were available there, and by interagency understanding, the Department of Justice and the Tax Court agree that any public requests would go to the Tax Court."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2105.225,2105.623,I--
1988.88-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2105.623,2110.568,"Or you're still entitled to get it from the department that you want to get it from, no matter what."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2110.568,2112.879,"--As a practical matter, that would be enough."
1988.88-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2115.23,2117.423,"Well, does it meet the statutory requirement in your view?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2117.423,2118.353,--I would say no.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.238,2187.483,"May I ask you one other practical... is your problem... I mean, I understand you represent a tax service, but wouldn't... wouldn't the same issue be presented in all sorts of other specialized areas of the law, such as Social Security or antitrust or criminal law, that... that the services could more conveniently get them from a centralized place and expedite their work?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2187.483,2187.703,--Yes.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.703,2187.941,Maybe that's good.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2188.131,2188.822,Yes.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.822,2192.224,--But there's really nothing special about the fact this is a tax case.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2192.224,2195.247,Nothing special about the fact that this is a tax case.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.187,2212.597,And presumably there's the same difficulty in getting all the opinions as promptly as you wanted them.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2212.597,2214.249,--I would have to assume so.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.249,2214.449,Yes.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2214.449,2230.861,"I will say this that tax law is something that touches every American, and I think is of more general importance and interest to all Americans than most other areas of law which have... which are somewhat more specialized."
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.331,2233.963,I think specialists in other areas of the law might disagree.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2234.303,2235.906,"I don't rely on that, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.906,2236.086,"Yes, yes."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2236.086,2239.178,Let me turn to the agency records issue.
1988.88-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2324.228,2336.256,"Now, why do you say that these are materials which are not promptly published and copies offered for sale under the services of various commercial publishers?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2336.256,2339.238,We are one of those publishers.
1988.88-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.238,2339.398,Uh-hum.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2339.398,2343.0,And our experience based on our--
1988.88-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2343.0,2350.784,"But you do have a statutory provision that says if materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale, it just doesn't apply."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2350.784,2357.079,--The point is they are not promptly published or completely published and offered for sale.
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.927,2396.859,Or if they dropped a copy in the reading room--
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2396.859,2398.321,Which is what we asked them to do.
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.321,2398.912,"--one way or the other, which is what you asked."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2398.912,2401.025,"If they dropped a copy in the reading room, that would take care of it."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2401.025,2410.369,"Going back through my list of five questions, if I may, both the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service use these documents in their business."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2470.322,2472.162,Insofar as we are an--
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.162,2472.953,Isn't that... isn't that right?
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2472.953,2481.839,"--Insofar as we are an agent for the public, it is important for the public to know what, for example, the Internal Revenue Service does with respect to taxpayers."
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.839,2483.97,"Well, I know, but that isn't why you want them."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2483.97,2487.552,"Well, we want them only... we are really a surrogate for the public."
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.365,2491.525,"Well, for $500--"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2491.525,2491.705,We publish them.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.705,2494.198,--For $500 a crack you want it for the public.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2494.198,2495.879,Which covers our costs.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.13,2498.691,"Well, you just don't--"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2498.691,2498.941,--Justice White.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.941,2500.874,--You just don't publish them for nothing.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2500.874,2501.903,That's quite right.
1988.88-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.385,2507.929,"Well, supposing the President sends over a directive to the Department of Justice to do something."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2516.505,2517.346,--I think it would.
1988.88-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2532.796,2541.853,"Well, then... then you're saying it just includes a great deal of what you might call secondary records that don't originate with the agency at all, but just happen to come to rest in the agency."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2541.853,2551.66,"Well, the test that this Court adopted in the Forsham case, looking to the Federal Records Act, was documents that the agency receives in the conduct of its public business."
1988.88-782,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2555.77,2562.486,"Well, does every agency have to become a... a library for the public?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2567.237,2568.389,Not as such.
1988.88-782,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2570.1,2570.971,Why not?
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2573.242,2575.733,"--Well, each--"
1988.88-782,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2575.733,2579.557,The agency assembles some books for use by its attorneys.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2585.323,2587.273,--There's no bright line test.
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.292,2616.143,Don't give away too much here now.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2619.027,2622.007,"--Thank you, sir."
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.007,2625.021,"You have a close case, I mean, one that--"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2630.946,2632.005,Juris.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.005,2633.167,"Juris, yes, Juris."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2634.769,2638.969,I'm not familiar enough with it except to know that it has a name.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2653.803,2657.436,Let me go back to the contents of the library a minute.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2670.386,2671.715,"Well, to--"
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.715,2672.716,"That would be just like this, wouldn't it?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2672.716,2679.521,--I suppose a distinction can be made that they have no unique relationship to the agency.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.521,2688.116,"Yes, but using your five factor formula and... and in trying to get a workable definition, can you give us a definition that would exclude those and include what you want?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2688.116,2696.343,"Well, they don't... in their... in their... unless, for example, there's... they've been marked up and written over by Department of Justice attorneys--"
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.343,2701.557,"Doing their regular... they may have a privacy exemption or something like that, but assume there's no exemption applicable."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2701.557,2708.782,"--Assuming there's nothing like that, they're not... they're not marked up and therefore contain no particular input from the Department of Justice--"
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.782,2710.104,"Well, I think they would be even better if they were marked up."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2711.125,2714.047,"--Well, if they are, then I think that's... they're more closely agency records, yes."
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.047,2714.187,Yes.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2714.187,2714.686,But if they're not marked--
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.686,2714.947,"Oh, I see."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2715.407,2721.151,"--I would, yes, they are more... they would be agency records because they reflect the operations of the agency."
1988.88-782,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2741.285,2743.606,And they also are published and available for sale presumably--
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2743.606,2744.027,That's right.
1988.88-782,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2744.197,2744.607,--by a publisher.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2744.607,2745.848,--They're also published and available.
1988.88-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.355,2761.721,"You could say with respect to Fed. Supplement that in it, it contains court decisions directing the Department of Justice how to conduct itself."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2761.721,2763.002,"Yes, it does."
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.579,2789.608,The books are available for sale to--
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2789.608,2795.182,They are available for sale and therefore probably wouldn't be... wouldn't... wouldn't be covered by the Freedom of Information Act.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2795.182,2797.125,"--Well, let me make sure I understand your position on available for sale."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2804.061,2808.314,"Well, the way I read the Act, it's available for sale by the agency."
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.314,2808.484,Yes.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2811.917,2812.658,That's... that's right.
1988.88-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.658,2816.6,--because these opinions are available for sale just as the Fed. Supplement is available for sale.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2816.6,2823.496,These opinions are available for sale in another format and in a way that does not relate them to the business of the Justice Department in any particular manner.
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.496,2837.777,"You mean... you mean the agency couldn't hire... couldn't... couldn't automatically, the way courts do, say we're going to have an official reporter of our opinions and let that person as a private matter commercially publish them and offer them for sale?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2837.777,2839.849,I would... I would say... as I said--
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2839.849,2841.03,"Gee, I thought that's precisely what that exemption was meant for?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2841.03,2845.863,"--As I said before, I think that's what... that would comply and OMB has... has suggested that."
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2848.956,2849.146,"So, why doesn't that cover F. Supp.--"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2849.547,2852.989,--Because they're acting as the... as the... as the agency's agent.
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.354,2864.118,"--So, that would cover F. Supp. I would presume."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2864.118,2864.298,No.
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.404,2896.852,"But other than copyright, if I buy your case, you're telling me I have to... I have to buy Freedom of Information requests for F. Supp. and I suppose a compendia of tax opinions, indeed, your own publication."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2904.038,2916.557,I don't think so because our publication isn't anything that within its four corners is a document that reflects the operations and functions of the agency.
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.557,2920.55,It has all these opinions that... that govern the... the operation of the agency.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2920.55,2922.791,And a lot of other... and a lot of other material as well.
1988.88-782,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2922.791,2925.142,But I... I thought that's the whole reason why you wanted it.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2933.239,2934.639,"Well, of course, it does."
1988.88-782,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2934.639,2934.879,That just eats up your case.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2934.879,2936.822,"Of course, it does."
1988.88-782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2984.919,2991.034,"Once... once again, all of those are on file in the Library of Congress, are they not?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2991.034,2993.103,"Not to my knowledge, Justice Marshall."
1988.88-782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2993.103,2994.193,You don't know whether or not.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2994.193,3007.953,I do not believe that the Department... that the Library of Congress obtains from anywhere the initial edition of the issuance of the... the copy of the opinion as issued by the Court.
1988.88-782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.953,3008.722,They have Fed. Supp.--
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3008.722,3010.785,It gets Fed. Supp. like everyone else.
1988.88-782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.785,3012.645,"--Well, why... why do you say they don't have anything else?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3012.645,3015.687,"Well, they have Fed. Supp., and presumably they'll have CCH--"
1988.88-782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.687,3016.428,Your answer is you just don't know.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3016.428,3021.063,"--and Prentice Hall, but they won't get the opinions in the format in which we are asking for them."
1988.88-782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3021.063,3021.433,You just don't know.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3023.536,3024.207,That's right.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.736,3031.601,"Oh, I suppose the lawyers in the Department of Justice... the tax lawyers... are using Prentice-Hall all the time, aren't they?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3031.601,3032.522,I'm sure they are.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.522,3039.678,It's much easier to use Prentice-Hall than to... than to go look around a lot of files.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3039.678,3040.018,Not--
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.018,3042.652,"Now, I suppose Prentice-Hall would be subject to--"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3042.652,3052.536,--They're not using Prentice-Hall in the same way that they're using the decisions when they get them and before they appear in Prentice-Hall some two or three months down the road.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.536,3052.686,"--Well, I don't know."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3058.282,3063.836,"He also looks at the decision that his friend, Mr. Barrister, down the hall just handed him a copy of saying--"
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3063.836,3063.976,That may be.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3063.976,3066.428,--look what the district court is doing here.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3066.428,3067.189,That may be.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3067.189,3068.458,That's the decision we want--
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3068.458,3069.7,"Well, I know, I know."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3069.7,3070.581,--not the Prentice-Hall decision.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.581,3071.771,"I know, but what if you did?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3071.771,3073.912,What if we did want Prentice-Hall?
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.912,3077.294,I would suppose that the Department would have to give it to you under your definition.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3077.294,3080.056,"Well, there... there is sort of a practical reason why."
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.653,3089.035,You mean it's like the Federal Supplement.
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3090.353,3099.239,"--It's unlikely that anyone would go to the Justice Department under the Freedom of Information Act to try to get a copy of something out of the Federal Supplement, wait 10 days and pay 10 cents a page."
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.239,3101.783,"But if you did... but if you did, you'd be entitled to it, I take it, under your--"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3101.783,3104.234,"I'm not saying we would, and I'm not saying we wouldn't."
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.107,3114.702,--I wish you would say you would or wouldn't because I... I find it very difficult to adopt a principle that's going to allow people to request F. Supp.--
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3125.611,3126.181,I think that--
1988.88-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.181,3128.254,"If it's Black's Law Dictionary, it's not an agency record."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3134.729,3135.58,--I would agree with that.
1988.88-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3136.58,3139.943,"Well, what would be the basis in the statute for accepting that distinction?"
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3139.943,3145.346,There isn't any basis in the statute because the statute doesn't define agency record.
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.242,3232.497,"Isn't it... isn't it true that when the... the Justice Department gets all these opinions, they don't keep those opinions in one file."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3240.711,3241.332,--They--
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.332,3243.626,That's the only agency record that--
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3243.626,3250.619,"--Well, we say, of course, that the decision itself is an agency record because of the way it is received and the way it is used."
1988.88-782,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3250.619,3251.42,"--No, but it isn't made there."
1988.88-782,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3251.42,3261.037,"No, but as Forsham... Forsham and Kissinger indicate be... simply being created by the agency is not the only test."
1988.88-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3262.659,3263.759,"Thank you, Mr. Dobrovir."
1988.88-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3265.482,3267.051,Yes.
1988.88-782,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3400.437,3406.972,Is it your position that responding to the request would not shed any light on the conduct of the government agency?
1988.88-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3406.972,3433.029,"It... it does in the sense that any decision of the courts reflects whether the position of the litigants are adopted or rejected, just as if the court's decision said we believe we have to reject the government's position on the authority of our precedent in Perkins v. Parker."
1988.88-782,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.173,3460.056,"It's also... if you added them all up, it would show how many cases the government won and how many they lose, how good the lawyers they've got."
1988.88-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3460.056,3461.608,--That is correct.
1988.88-782,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3470.995,3472.727,"That's irrelevant, Mr. Wallace."
1988.88-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3480.304,3483.396,But there's no... there's nothing in the way the government--
1988.88-782,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3483.396,3483.526,And--
1988.88-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3483.526,3487.689,--is compiling or keeping them that sheds any light on government business.
1988.88-782,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3487.689,3501.317,"--That... that quote that you read that says there's nothing in the history of the Act that indicates that one of its purposes was to be a boon to academic researchers, that may well not have been one of its explicit purposes, but you don't deny that that has been one of its major effects."
1988.88-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3501.317,3504.021,Where properly applied.
1988.88-782,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3504.021,3504.38,Where properly applied.
1988.88-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3504.38,3510.975,"Where properly applied, but it's not to get information that the government has assembled that doesn't show what the government is doing."
1988.88-782,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3510.975,3514.047,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
