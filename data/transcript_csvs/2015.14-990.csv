2015.14-990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.81,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-990, Shapiro v. McManus. Mr. Kimberly."
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,7.81,103.53,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 2284(a) states in plain terms that a district court of three judges shall be convened when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts. Section 2284(b) lays out the procedure for calling a three-judge court when the circumstances identified in 2284 are satisfied. It -- it reads, quote, ""Upon the filing of a request for three judges, the judge to whom the request is presented shall, unless he determines that three judges are not required, immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges."" Now, although that language did not appear in the statute until the 1976 amendments, it was no more than a congressional recognition and codification of what was then by settled -- what was by then settled practice, that a complaint covered by 2284(a) would have, initially, to be referred to a single judge, that the litigants then would have to file a request for a three-judge district court, and in turn that the single judge would have to determine whether three judges were, in fact, required. Now, at the time that Congress enacted that long-standing practice in the 1976 amendments to the Act, this Court's precedents had made clear that one basis upon which three judges are, quote, ""not required"" is when the claim is constitutionally insubstantial. Congress is presumed to have been aware of -- of this Court's precedents so holding, and in the absence of a contrary indication -- and here there is none -- to have intended that interpretation of the words ""not required"" to be incorporated into the statute."
2015.14-990,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,103.53,118.395,What if it's perfectly clear that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment? Let's say the State legislature goes back to its pre Reynolds v. Sims method of constituting the State legislature.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,121.03,127.025,"If it is -- if the claim is obviously foreclosed by this Court's precedents, then no, it doesn't."
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.63,140.83,"Well, what --"
2015.14-990,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,140.83,142.02,How do you square that --
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.02,142.55,Go ahead.
2015.14-990,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,142.55,145.385,Okay. How do you square that with the statutory language?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,145.385,163.25,"Well, we think that's embodied in the words ""not required."" In -- in the two and three years before Congress inserted the key language in Section 2284(b), this Court had said in Goosby that three -- that a three-judge district court is, quote, ""not required"" when the claim is insubstantial."
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.25,167.415,Maybe Goosby was wrong. You don't think Goosby was wrong?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,167.415,181.85,"Well, I -- Goosby represents what had been, by then, nearly 50 years of practice beginning with this Court's decision in Poresky. For what it's worth, I will say I -- I think if Goosby is wrong, we still end up winning because --"
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,181.85,182.56,"Oh, I know that."
2015.14-990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,184.65,187.95,"Well -- I'm sorry. Well -- I'm sorry, why don't you --"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,187.95,193.04,"Well, I -- I -- I would just say, I think the path of least resistance here in reversing the Fourth Circuit is not to overturn that precedent."
2015.14-990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,195.375,213.43,"What do you do if your argument in -- in a case that might go before a three-judge court is that the Court's precedents should be overruled? It's clearly foreclosed by the Court's precedents, but maybe there's a very good argument that the -- those precedents are -- haven't withstood the test of time or whatever. What happens then?"
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,213.43,214.65,This Court's precedents?
2015.14-990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,214.65,215.19,"Yes, yes."
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,215.19,216.27,This Court's precedents. I think --
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,216.27,218.08,I understand the Chief Justice.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,218.08,226.19,"So I think in that circumstance, at least according to the Goosby rule, is that the case would proper -- properly be dismissed for -- for lack of jurisdiction as not stating --"
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.19,228.62,By the -- by the -- by the single-judge court?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,228.62,232.4,"By the single-judge court. And -- and if -- if, then, this Court --"
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.4,234.48,I have -- I have some problems with that.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,248.85,252.38,"Well, I -- I think according to the substantiality rule, yes."
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,254.815,258.205,And I'm surprised -- you think they do need to take that position?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,258.205,258.64,No.
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.7,282.34,I -- I take it Goosby is not parallel to Rule 11.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,288.12,288.36,No.
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,291.7,291.87,"Oh, really?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,291.87,295.61,-- standard provides is that the claim must be obviously frivolous.
2015.14-990,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,309.79,314.07,Am I right that Goosby thought of that as part of the jurisdictional question?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,314.07,314.6,That's correct.
2015.14-990,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,314.6,317.01,"In other words, it's an application of Bell v. Hood --"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,317.01,317.44,That's correct.
2015.14-990,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,317.44,323.635,"-- which suggests that if something is so obviously frivolous, then the Court has no jurisdiction on it at all?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,323.635,328.1,That is not a bona fide case and controversy within the meaning of Article III. That's exactly right.
2015.14-990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,328.1,332.46,"But it's a very difficult line you're drawing, and -- and I understand Bell v. Hood."
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,357.94,363.97,"Well, I -- I think I'd say two things about that. The first -- I mean, that -- that catalog of adjectives appears in Goosby."
2015.14-990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,390.38,394.22,"Well, you call it -- I guess my concern -- you call it a rule, but it's really not much of a rule."
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,414.26,426.32,"I -- I agree entirely, and I -- and I guess what I -- what I would say on top of that is that if -- if the Court is concerned to avoid fuzzy and difficult rules, that certainly is a reason not to adopt Respondents' position."
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.32,441.33,"Could the Respondents argue that, in the light of Iqbal and Twombly, Goosby should be reconsidered, and the Federal court should have some -- district court, single judge should have some more authority? Or does that work the other way, do you think?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,441.33,442.6,I -- I think it works the other way.
2015.14-990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,483.435,493.995,Does it depend -- does your argument depend on categorization of what is frivolous in the Goosby language as being jurisdictional?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,493.995,504.36,"I think if the Court were to continue that line of cases here and to hold that that is a basis for declining the convening of a three-judge court, yes."
2015.14-990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.775,521.65,So what happens under the current statute that calls for a three-judge court on request of a party? Suppose nobody requests the three-judge court.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,526.845,550.78,"Well, our -- our view, in light of this Court's precedence, is no, that it isn't waivable and it's -- it's a jurisdictional statute that -- that the -- the judge would be without -- that a single judge would be without power to consider the merits in the case covered by the statute. But I should say that that also isn't necessarily a question that's presented here because, even if it's just a claims-processing rule, it's still a mandatory claims-processing rule."
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.09,573.715,You -- you -- you don't think -- and let's assume that -- that Goosby is jurisdictional. Does that mean that we must let the single judge determine it?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,573.715,575.29,"Well, I --"
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.29,583.1,Why is it that the single judge must determine the jurisdictional question? Why can't that be left to the three-judge court just as everything else is?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,583.1,587.18,"To be clear, I don't think a single judge does have to decide the jurisdictional question."
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.47,606.975,Perhaps the jurisdiction has to go to that court as well.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,606.975,608.45,"I -- I think that's right, yes."
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,609.71,617.935,"Does -- does the waiver argument, the argument that this can be waived by the consent of all parties, does that rest on decisions of this Court?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,617.935,619.42,Not so far as I'm aware.
2015.14-990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,647.42,647.74,In my -- what --
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,647.74,650.415,Has the waiver rule been adopted by some of the circuits?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,650.415,651.87,"Not -- in fact, no."
2015.14-990,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,655.63,656.15,"Well, why do you --"
2015.14-990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,656.15,677.355,"But there was a -- there was a change in '76, and that's when they put in ""upon the filing of a request."" And that language suggests that it isn't a jurisdictional question, because if a party has to request it, it normally follows if a party doesn't request it, it's waived."
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,677.355,682.64,"Well, I -- I -- I wouldn't disagree that that is one possible way to read the statute."
2015.14-990,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,707.79,713.95,"In reality, on the ground, what percentage of cases is there a request for a three-judge court?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,713.95,714.675,"Oh, all of them."
2015.14-990,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,715.14,716.68,Litigants want this?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,716.68,717.37,Ah --
2015.14-990,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,717.37,722.995,"Are there any litigants that say to themselves, I'd rather have a one-judge court, thanks?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,722.995,725.92,Not so far as I'm aware.
2015.14-990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,737.77,753.01,"It -- wasn't it a practice in the old days that if you didn't want the three-judge court, you simply didn't ask for injunctive relief? You filed a complaint for declaratory relief and then you didn't -- you could get your one judge?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,753.01,754.255,That may be so.
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.11,776.0,I don't know why it's contrary to a jurisdictional status that it has to be requested.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,787.99,788.81,That's exactly right.
2015.14-990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,795.04,798.99,Let me get back to the question Justice Kagan asked.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,822.72,826.8,It was true in 1910 when the first version of this statute was enacted.
2015.14-990,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,858.945,869.595,"And plaintiffs liked it because you could skip over the court of appeals and go right to this Court, and on appeal rather than certiorari."
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,869.595,870.34,That's right.
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.1,935.83,Sure it is.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,936.47,936.92,Well --
2015.14-990,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.92,938.42,Really think that's questionable?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,938.42,939.98,I actually don't think it's questionable.
2015.14-990,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,957.72,985.465,"How do you think the -- the Goosby Rule applies to political gerrymandering claims in general? This Court has never seen one that it thought was justiciable. Do you think there are any that -- but assuming that the possibility that there might be one is enough to take the case to the three-judge court? And if that's so, are there any that would not go to a three-judge court?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,985.465,987.81,I -- I think there are some that wouldn't go.
2015.14-990,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1000.57,1013.32,"But so long as it favors who -- the party that controlled the legislature when the plan was drawn up, which is almost always the case, couldn't a political gerrymandering claim be made that that's why it was done?"
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1013.32,1021.17,"I -- I think that's right, and I think that's why we see most of these claims rightly being sent to three-judge district courts, just as Congress intended."
2015.14-990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1021.17,1029.705,"We might get to this question, but at some point somebody is going to have to say whether you do have a substantial claim."
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1029.705,1030.94,That's right.
2015.14-990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.26,1037.02,Is it?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1037.02,1037.96,"Well, I think so --"
2015.14-990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1037.96,1038.7,Because?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1038.7,1046.11,There is no -- no decision of this Court -- binding decision of this Court holding that our claim is wholly foreclosed.
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1046.11,1046.595,Vieth?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1046.595,1047.16,No.
2015.14-990,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1047.83,1049.24,Because? (Laughter.)
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1049.24,1054.705,"Well, Vieth -- Vieth has -- I think the threshold question is what is the controlling opinion in Vieth."
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1089.68,1090.33,I didn't understand.
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1094.81,1102.8,"Well, I think -- I think the single judge below Judge Breyer would have to address the question whether three judges are required under proper standards."
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1109.93,1112.005,So you'd want to brief it under Goosby or something?
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1112.005,1122.91,"Yeah, that's right, under the proper insubstantiality standard. Now, as I say, I think that issue has been briefed before this Court, and it's a sufficiently easy question to answer --"
2015.14-990,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.91,1123.48,"Oh, I see."
2015.14-990,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1123.48,1125.345,-- that it's something this Court can reach.
2015.14-990,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1130.27,1135.06,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sullivan."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1135.06,1145.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1976, Congress considerably narrowed the circumstances that would call for the procedural device of a three-judge court."
2015.14-990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1170.83,1177.03,"May I go back to something you just said? Because I thought that the word ""required"" was in the statute."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1180.62,1181.72,Well --
2015.14-990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1181.72,1184.16,Required to be heard by a three-judge court.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1184.16,1187.67,But it wasn't for an authorization for a single judge.
2015.14-990,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1206.56,1220.375,"On what basis are -- it sounds to me that you're giving a meaning to ""not required"" that was different to the meaning we gave to it pre-1976."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1221.825,1224.36,I -- I don't think that's necessarily the case.
2015.14-990,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1228.65,1243.735,"I -- he took out the adjectives, descriptors from our case law: ""Insubstantial,"" ""wholly insubstantial,"" ""frivolous,"" ""obviously or essentially frivolous."" I mean --"
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1243.735,1244.32,But that --
2015.14-990,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1244.32,1250.07,-- that's very different than a 12(b)(3) motion.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1250.07,1266.0,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor, that -- those words appear, but in the prior case law before 1976, this Court had, in two important cases, permitted a district judge to adjudicate the entire case notwithstanding the presence of a substantial claim raised by the plaintiff."
2015.14-990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1346.84,1362.55,"Well, they -- they want to raise about as important a question as you can imagine. They want to say, reading Vieth, that the State legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries the way that has been done here."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1391.915,1406.98,"Well, Congress, if it had looked back at this Court's case law, would have seen that this Court regularly denied three-judge courts even where there was an important issue such as when the preemption was the issue."
2015.14-990,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1407.49,1409.96,Do you want to give me a list of those cases with -- I'm going to continue it.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1409.96,1410.24,Yes.
2015.14-990,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1411.38,1412.65,Answer Justice Breyer.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1412.65,1419.7,"So the -- the Court's concern, it was always a narrow interpretation of the statute for very important reasons."
2015.14-990,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1468.565,1483.195,"Well, haven't they strayed from that -- or Congress has, because Congress said you also get a three-judge court if you're attacking a Federal statute, right? It started out with the concern about enjoining State statutes."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1491.33,1502.81,That was probably to protect an analogous Federal interest in having its -- its laws not improvidently enjoined.
2015.14-990,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1519.005,1533.97,"Can I make sure I understand what you're saying, because what you're saying now is different from what I had thought that your briefs were saying? I had thought in your briefs that you were relying on changes in the law that -- that Congress made in -- I think it's 1976; is that right?"
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1533.97,1534.495,Yes.
2015.14-990,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1534.495,1549.06,"But now you're suggesting that you're not relying on that, that you're saying that before that, we -- we viewed as acceptable a -- a one-judge court dismissing a case."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1556.725,1564.93,I think the important thing is the amendments that we pointed out in our brief are -- were significant changes in -- in the structure and meaning of the statute.
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.38,1585.195,It's a winner for you -- it's a winner for you if those prior cases say what you say they say.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1585.195,1586.58,"I hope so, Your Honor."
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1587.695,1589.575,"Well, it should have been in your brief."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1592.655,1602.99,"Well, you know, I'm trying to provide value now in addition to what we had in the brief. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-990,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1602.99,1607.13,"For my edification, what are the cases -- I know Bailey is one."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1608.855,1615.63,"Well, in Swift v. Wickham is the best exposition of what this narrow construction or restrictive construction is about."
2015.14-990,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1854.805,1859.15,"Mr. Sullivan, I -- I -- I guess I'm -- I'm not so inclined to think that."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1888.495,1896.935,"Well, it's easy when it's the little green men and the extraterrestrials, but that's not the cases that have arisen and been addressed by this Court."
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.94,1937.2,"I don't know what you mean by ""extraterrestrials."" What are these --"
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1937.2,1938.79,Some of the case law refers to --
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1938.79,1940.23,Aliens? No?
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1940.23,1941.06,Aliens -- aliens.
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.0,1954.39,Okay.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1957.52,1958.23,Yes.
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.23,1958.88,Outlandish.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1959.315,1960.365,Outlandish.
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.365,1960.82,Okay.
2015.14-990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.82,1964.56,"Bailey is -- I mean, Bailey was the mirror-image case."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2003.79,2004.74,But there's --
2015.14-990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.74,2010.91,He's speaking nonexistent. And they said it's nonexistent because it's clear what the Federal law was.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2014.265,2028.165,"Well, I don't know if it helps, but I think it doesn't help Petitioners the idea that that's a significant expansion, if not a complete departure from Bell v. Hood, which addressed when a complaint could be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it's insubstantial."
2015.14-990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.675,2037.81,"That's true, but I mean, they put down a standard as to whether or not a three-judge court is necessary."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2058.62,2059.63,"The law was clear, and --"
2015.14-990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.63,2059.72,Yes.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2059.72,2063.05,-- the single-district judge should have been allowed to address that in argument --
2015.14-990,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2063.05,2063.34,All right.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2070.325,2107.455,"But I would submit that, under this -- the Court's prevailing rule, the Court -- the Court adopts the Federal rules, and all -- all district judges are bound for them. If a district judge is entitled to grant relief, as under the Bailey case, it seems reasonable to allow that judge to determine that a complaint on its face is legally sufficient, as the court would in any other case. These -- these rules are binding, unless you can find in the statute a reason that compels the district judge not to comply with the civil -- the rules of civil procedure, then the district judge is in his or her rights?"
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.455,2111.655,"So you say ""required in the statute"" means ""states a claim""?"
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2111.655,2122.05,"Well, I think that it could -- it incorporates that understanding as much as it would incorporate the insubstantiality, because both are presumptions that courts rely on."
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.38,2153.645,So let -- let's assume you have a district judge who says it fails to state a claim.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2157.705,2159.61,"To the court of appeals, as in every other case."
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.61,2168.32,"So it goes all the way up, and if -- if he loses in the court of appeals, he tries to come up here, right? And we finally decide it did state a claim."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2173.48,2174.415,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.415,2175.8,Wow.
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.105,2186.755,"It's extraterrestrial, as he said. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2186.755,2203.045,"But -- but I -- I understand your reaction, but I think that comes -- when you have a departure from the norm, as the three-judge statute creates, you're going to have some situations that may be a little bit stickier than otherwise that you have had in a normal functioning of the content."
2015.14-990,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2203.785,2209.09,"I mean, the other alternative is it's a three-judge district court, and then we have to take it on the merits."
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2225.295,2235.81,"Well, you had seven more direct appeals from Maryland, as we cite in our -- in our brief, that -- the cases we've had in recent years that were dismissed by a single judge, they would have all come here."
2015.14-990,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.56,2268.09,We care even more than Congress.
2015.14-990,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2269.375,2275.875,I hope you care deeply and -- and deeply enough to -- to affirm this reasonable interpretation.
2015.14-990,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2284.39,2290.675,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kimberly, you have 11 minutes left."
2015.14-990,2,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2290.675,2309.77,"Just a few quick points. First, a comment about Swift v. Wickham. This is a case that we addressed on page 5 in footnote 1 in our reply brief. The holding in that case was simply that a preemption claim is not a constitutional claim within the meaning of the statute."
2015.14-990,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.94,2318.27,Explain why that's so.
2015.14-990,2,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2324.34,2326.26,"Well, I -- I don't -- that's not the holding in the case."
2015.14-990,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.9,2354.12,And it doesn't matter whether that's frivolous or not?
2015.14-990,2,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2354.12,2354.68,That's right.
2015.14-990,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2361.34,2378.125,"Does it happen often that a single judge will say there are three issues here; one would definitely involve a three-judge court, but the previous are ones that I can reach, and so I will reach those first. Does that happen very often?"
2015.14-990,2,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2378.125,2381.18,Not so far we're aware of. We -- we are aware that it has happened.
2015.14-990,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.85,2443.71,"To -- to -- to say otherwise, we -- we would have to say that you get -- you get no appeal in one category of case."
2015.14-990,3,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2453.035,2454.13,"Well, I think --"
2015.14-990,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.13,2464.5,"And that's what you're saying, that -- that Congress would have provided for no appeal whatever if you -- if you -- if -- if -- if the State wins."
2015.14-990,4,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2465.96,2471.515,"Well, I -- I -- I think Respondents' position is if relief can be denied, it may be granted."
2015.14-990,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2501.39,2541.945,"I -- as far -- as far as I understand it, his strongest argument on the other side would roughly go -- he didn't put it this way -- like this: On your side is the fact, well, why wouldn't a three-judge court decide a very important question of law in this area? On the other side of it is that, well, you just have left, in three-judge courts primarily, almost exclusively, reapportionment issues, which are specially political. And to put these all, you know, they are very -- because of the opinions you point out in Vieth, there's a huge variation of all kinds of different legal claims that might be made."
2015.14-990,4,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2579.455,2581.455,So I have two responses to that.
2015.14-990,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2634.99,2641.655,"So now you have -- now you have cases quite often, particularly in the most sensitive ones, decided by a vote of two to one."
2015.14-990,4,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2651.225,2675.565,"Well, so that leads to me to the second half of my response, and that is that in the majority of these cases that make it before this Court on mandatory review, the Court generally enters a summary affirmance and doesn't note probable jurisdiction and take full briefing. When the Court affirms on the basis -- affirms on the -- without taking full argument and briefing, there's a limited presidential effect to those decisions."
2015.14-990,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2681.55,2683.255,"Well, to go back to your --"
2015.14-990,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2683.255,2697.07,"Just to follow up: In -- in recent years, is it true that in reapportionment cases, the majority of the way we've handled direct appeals has been summarily?"
2015.14-990,4,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2697.07,2701.6,"With all due respect, I think you'd probably be in a better position to answer that."
2015.14-990,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2701.6,2701.76,"No, no."
2015.14-990,4,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2703.955,2711.49,"I mean, certainly the Court has been taking a large number of these cases recently. It's been two or three each term."
2015.14-990,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2712.42,2716.14,"When you say ""taking"" them, I mean, they're being presented to us. We have no choice, but taking -- (Laughter.)"
2015.14-990,4,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2716.14,2716.34,Right.
2015.14-990,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2732.6,2751.59,"On the issue of political sensitivity, if it goes to a single judge, you will have a decision by a judge who has presumably been selected by the spin of the wheel, or by -- at random, and then you'll have an appeal to a court of appeals panel that is presumably chosen at random."
2015.14-990,4,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2789.995,2802.93,"Well, I -- it may be so that in those cases, if -- if a litigant or a member of the public dug down behind how the panel is appointed, that there might be a basis for raising a concern."
2015.14-990,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2829.49,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
