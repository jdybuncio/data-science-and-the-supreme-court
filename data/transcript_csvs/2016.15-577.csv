2016.15-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.27,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-577, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer. Mr. Cortman."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,9.27,28.495,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State of Missouri has excluded The Learning Center from a recycling program that provides a safer playground for children solely because the preschool is operated by a church rather than a secular not-for-profit. The State has made several important concessions in this case."
2016.15-577,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,60.36,95.76,"Assuming that there's no serious risk of an establishment violation, that's off the table, are there ever instances in which status -- religious status can be used to deny religions or religious believers benefits from the State? Or are you saying that it's -- that absent in Establishment Clause problem, that status can never be the base -- religious status can never be the basis for a governmental action or governmental ordinance, governmental statute?"
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,95.76,97.06,I -- I'm not sure if it can be.
2016.15-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,106.14,131.11,"On that -- on that question, I guess rather long ago now in the Everson case back in 1947, this Court said in no uncertain terms what the Framers didn't want was tax money imposed to pay for building or maintaining churches or church property."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,139.51,149.785,I don't think it does. Everson also said that we have to be careful in not establishing a church not to deprive religious people or organizations of general government benefits.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,158.09,170.93,So how is the building separate from the religious exercise therein? I believe that this playground is part of the ministry of this church.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,191.56,193.54,I think the way the Court always has.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,203.36,207.88,"Well, how about if the school does a prayer before the children start playing?"
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,207.88,208.5,I don't think --
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,208.5,213.965,Or how about if it chooses on a sunny day to do its religious instruction outside.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,229.31,229.55,Sure.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,248.35,248.47,But --
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,248.47,251.14,"-- religious schools, just not for religious activities."
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,251.14,260.76,"So do you think, Mr. Cortman, suppose there was an application and a -- from a -- a church that used its playground for religious activities."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,272.555,274.56,I -- I think it would be a different case.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,279.97,281.64,That they -- I'm sorry. They don't think they should --
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,281.64,283.46,They should be able to deny it on that ground.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,303.48,309.935,"How would you -- for example, one of the things that the Court has -- has thought about in the past is like computers for education."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,323.54,337.3,"I -- I think it's actually easier than computers because you don't have to get into diversion and all the -- the concept this Court has talked about over the -- over the years in the Mitchell case and the other types of cases. And here the reason is, is that what we're talking about is just a surface."
2016.15-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,367.04,367.28,But don't you --
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,367.28,368.07,And all my point --
2016.15-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,368.07,368.57,I'm sorry.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,369.21,373.56,All my point is I think that would be going too far because it's not advancing or furthering the religious activity.
2016.15-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,374.645,380.19,I'm not sure I understand your answer to the playground being used for a more religious activity.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,406.895,408.36,I think it can.
2016.15-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,410.33,410.86,I'm sorry.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,412.36,440.78,"I think they should be able to -- I think both the public schools should be able to use it for other activities, and I think that the religious schools should be able to also. And -- and as I mentioned, I think the reason for that is it would be a penalty on the benefit to say because we're putting up a safer surface for when the kids play and fall, and that's the main activity here, if for some reason someone prays one day there or they decide to go outside for -- for one event, that doesn't -- it's not the government there who's advancing religion."
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,444.46,444.68,Would you say --
2016.15-577,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,444.68,457.86,"Are all of these questions really ones that verge onto the Establishment Clause; fire extinguishers, bible lessons on a sunny day, and so forth? Because we could go on and on."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,482.92,483.69,They -- they are.
2016.15-577,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.61,502.04,"But -- see, but that's what makes the case a -- just a little bit -- in -- in -- in my last hypothetical about earthquake safety, any problem there with giving the money to a church and spending extra money for the cross in the window? It's all -- it's for public safety."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,502.04,506.77,"I think it would be an issue on the -- on the Establishment Clause, the question of the Establishment Clause."
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,525.46,526.19,"Well, I'm sorry --"
2016.15-577,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,526.19,533.595,"Going back to my first question, that means what your position is, if there is no Establishment violation, there can never be a distinction based on religion."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,533.595,534.81,I wouldn't say never.
2016.15-577,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.21,536.18,Give me an example.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,536.18,539.76,"Well, play in -- what comes to mind is Locke v. Davey and play in the joints."
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,553.3,553.71,I'm sorry --
2016.15-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.71,554.09,We -- we did --
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,554.09,554.58,-- but it does --
2016.15-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,554.58,561.93,"We did say in this case -- well, I think you stipulated that this school has a nondiscriminatory admissions policy."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,601.615,607.86,"I -- I think they can, because they have a -- they have a free exercise right to religious autonomy to decide who their members are."
2016.15-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.095,614.97,"So this church could say, we will take only Lutheran children."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,614.97,615.98,I believe it can.
2016.15-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,615.98,617.72,And -- and still get the public money.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,617.72,630.29,"I believe so, because we're still at the premise of -- of why are we making the church choose between exercising its religion, the same facts in McDaniel v. Paty, and saying he can't both be a minister and also be a constitutional delegate."
2016.15-577,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,630.29,638.875,"Mr. Cortman, do we know what Missouri -- how Missouri interprets the term ""church"" in its constitution? It speaks about church."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,664.45,666.48,I think it would depending on how religious it is.
2016.15-577,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,673.05,674.065,So if it's controlled.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,674.065,679.28,"That's right. And also, any religious organizations that are sectarian or denominational."
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,705.895,715.18,"Mr. Cortman, my questions about religious uses, I think, was to get at a -- a broader point, a broader distinction, and asked -- ask what you think of it."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,731.85,732.11,Yes.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,732.11,759.565,"And that's the way you briefed the case. I hear you making a different argument, or a broader argument now, that extends into a State's decision to deny some uses -- to deny funding to some uses at the same time as it gives funding to other uses, and a State's decision to say, look, we really just don't want to fund religious exercise."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,771.915,774.55,I don't think it's a broader argument that we're making.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,812.9,812.99,Okay.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,814.22,814.43,That's right.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,814.43,827.32,"But the State is entitled to say you can't use this money for religious activity, and maybe I'll bring you a little bit further, we're entitled to take certain prophylactic measures to make sure that you don't use the money for religious activity."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,827.32,827.815,Yes.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,839.01,839.58,"Well, then how about the --"
2016.15-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,839.58,847.59,What does the record show about non-daycare or playground activities on this surface?
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,847.59,852.635,There's -- there's nothing in the record that occurs except for children playing on the playground.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,852.635,855.48,"Excuse me, but you were talking about Locke --"
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,855.48,855.63,Yeah.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,855.63,857.62,-- and how this is dissimilar from Locke.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,857.62,858.19,Yes.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,858.19,860.735,"Well, there is a tradition."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,947.115,947.56,Sure.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,955.14,958.0,But why is that coercion with respect to your beliefs?
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,958.0,960.51,"Because it's -- it's a choice, just like with McDaniel v. Paty."
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,970.35,972.02,But you can have a playground here.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,972.02,975.59,But you can't be -- you can't be a religious organization and have a playground.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,975.59,978.99,You have a playground. No one is taking the playground away from you.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,978.99,979.19,No.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,982.81,982.88,No.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,991.83,992.255,Right.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,992.255,995.255,"Here, there's nothing being taken away from."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,995.255,995.6,Sure.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1002.07,1039.54,"What do we do with discrimination for religion under your theory? Because the way you're going in your theory is an expansion of McDaniel; but putting aside that it's an expansion of McDaniel, what are we going to end up with when secular people say religious people are being discriminated in favor of and against us? If status should not be an effect on free exercise, what are we going to do with tax benefits?"
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1039.54,1039.81,I think --
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1039.81,1043.59,What are we going to do with all the exemptions that churches receive?
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1043.59,1043.84,Sure.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1043.84,1044.89,Those are benefits.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1044.89,1045.29,Sure.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1055.91,1060.4,"Well, there's plenty of people who would think tax exemption goes too far."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1060.4,1060.705,Right.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1060.705,1062.04,But I don't.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1065.21,1065.56,Sure.
2016.15-577,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1112.76,1115.11,"And Mr. Cortman, I don't know whether we -- excuse me."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1146.415,1147.38,I don't.
2016.15-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1178.58,1180.85,"There is a serious debate about that, isn't there?"
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1180.85,1181.2,There is.
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.485,1197.98,"Has the -- has the -- the State courts, have they ever said the amendment prevents the State from giving grants or from spending money on police protection for churches?"
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1197.98,1199.665,"They -- they have not, and --"
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.665,1211.335,"Have they ever said that it prevents the State from, say, having a -- a border guard, you know, crossing guards or fire protection? Or, let's say, health inspections?"
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1211.335,1212.34,They have not.
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.34,1212.58,Okay.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1212.58,1212.8,But what --
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.8,1223.405,"In that case, why, just -- just like you and the other side to spend a minute on this, just a minute, why isn't the case moot? That is, we have a governor."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1250.135,1250.79,No.
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1250.79,1252.92,You just want an injunction for the future.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1252.92,1253.88,Because of the 11th Amendment.
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.88,1257.67,"And you're going to get that injunction, whether you want it or not, with the present governor."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1257.67,1259.63,"Possibly, and likely, temporarily."
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1259.63,1260.93,"And that's -- well, temporarily."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1262.86,1263.35,Yes.
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.35,1263.93,What?
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1263.93,1268.95,"Well -- well, for -- if the political winds change, we have -- we have this policy by Facebook or press release."
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1270.88,1270.96,No.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1273.175,1275.25,I -- I -- excuse me.
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1279.03,1279.285,Okay.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1279.285,1282.12,"In fact, I think those cases are more difficult cases than --"
2016.15-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1282.12,1282.23,Okay.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1282.43,1285.185,"-- this case, because of the voluntary cessation proposition."
2016.15-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1286.01,1292.65,"There's two -- there's two questions, isn't there? One is we're talking about is the case moot, and I think, technically, it's not moot."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1310.41,1315.73,"This case would have to be here, I guess, in a different posture, maybe coming from the other side, if that was already the policy."
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1373.665,1383.43,"May I take you back to the substance, Mr. Cortman, unless anybody -- it's -- let's talk a little bit about federalism, and here's what I would like to know."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1397.06,1397.29,Right.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1397.29,1398.55,-- this institution.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1435.095,1437.64,Because I don't think this is one of the difficult cases.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1465.67,1469.82,"Well, that's, of course, true, that if there's a -- a constitutional right at stake, that trumps."
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1485.22,1490.49,I think States have tremendous leeway in the way they set up and decide these types of programs.
2016.15-577,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1532.55,1535.28,But one last -- I know your white light is on.
2016.15-577,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1569.35,1569.73,Sure.
2016.15-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.42,1618.385,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Layton."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1618.385,1652.61,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Alito asked the question as to whether this is an admirable tradition that should be respected, this 39-State tradition of have -- keeping hands off of religion, and the answer from the States' view is yes. In 1820, Missouri's first constitutional convention adopted from Jefferson's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom the language that, ""No man can be compelled to erect, support, or attend any place of worship."" We modified that, made it more specific in the 1865 and 1875 constitutions."
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1676.455,1680.13,"Well, you don't want us -- you say we don't have to look at the Establishment Clause."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1683.73,1684.02,No.
2016.15-577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1711.7,1719.215,And is it your argument that this statute is valid to keep us away from close Establishment Clause questions?
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1719.215,1720.045,Yes.
2016.15-577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.42,1738.745,"But -- but this -- this is quite different than Locke, because this is a status-based statute."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1738.745,1740.78,"Well, in -- in that respect, it is different."
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1756.465,1764.78,"Well, Mr. Layton, you said you don't want to -- you don't want to have a program that makes physical improvements to -- to churches."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1825.005,1839.0,"The answer traditionally -- and I'm not sure that I can speak for the current governor -- of course, I was brought back to argue this case and instructed I could defend the prior position, but the answer traditionally would be no."
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1850.76,1851.01,Okay.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1868.355,1876.55,"Under the traditional view of -- in the State of Missouri, it would not be permitted, provided that those were actually church buildings. Worship buildings."
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1876.55,1876.77,Okay.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1892.02,1905.405,"Again, under the traditional view in Missouri, if -- if this was actually a cash grant, money leaving the public treasury to go to a church, it would not be permissible. Now, that doesn't mean that a religious-affiliated school could not qualify."
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1915.54,1922.44,So what is the definition of a church? So a religiously-affiliated school is not a church under the -- under the Missouri constitution?
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1922.44,1945.09,"The decision with regard to St. Louis University was that even though it is a Jesuit institution that is founded by Jesuits, had a Jesuit president and Jesuits on its board, since it had a self-perpetuating board, even though it declared a -- a Jesuit philosophy, it was determined to be eligible to receive -- in that instance not direct payment from the State, but eligible to receive State funds."
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1945.09,1945.3,But why --
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1945.3,1945.67,Mr. Layton --
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1945.67,1947.145,Why would that be so?
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1947.145,1956.63,I suspect because the Missouri courts are trying to provide as much assistance as they can within the realm that they feel that the Missouri constitution permits.
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1956.63,1956.88,Oh.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1972.5,1974.44,It would depend on the nature of the two.
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1990.42,1993.52,But even though they're equally controlled by a religious organizations?
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1993.52,1994.12,No.
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2016.22,2018.83,"Mr. Layton, could we go back to where Justice Alito started --"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2018.83,2019.05,Yes.
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2019.05,2021.17,-- and -- and you said no money to churches.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2025.42,2030.82,"Well, the -- the -- the State does, and I think for a couple of reasons."
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2055.1,2057.08,"Yeah, but the whole -- that's easy to change."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2072.975,2073.19,That --
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.19,2078.2,We don't want -- we don't -- we don't want to because they're a church. That's why not. Same with fire protection.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2095.635,2097.61,"Well, this -- this differs --"
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.61,2101.79,"No, I'm not asking that yet. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2101.79,2103.44,So what -- what are you asking first?
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2103.44,2104.44,I'm asking -- (Laughter.)
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.44,2124.045,"I'm asking, does the Constitution of the United States permit a State or a city to say, we give everybody in this city police protection, but not churches? We give everybody fire protection, but let the church burn down."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2139.78,2142.93,I -- I am not going to take the position that it permits those laws --
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2142.93,2143.31,All right.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2182.65,2190.7,"The difference is that the establishment concerns that motivate Missouri's policy do not apply in the police and fire context, but they apply here."
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2190.7,2192.19,Why in health context? So if there's --
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2192.19,2192.25,No.
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.25,2193.02,-- an epidemic?
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2193.02,2195.05,"No, I don't know that they apply in health context."
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2216.01,2217.06,"Mr. Layton, I understand that --"
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2217.06,2229.16,"The Establishment Clause -- the -- the entire basis for your rule is that you're afraid of violating the Establishment Clause, even though you're sure there's no violation of the Establishment Clause?"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2229.16,2229.22,No.
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2238.87,2241.68,"No, you take the position that it is not, that this is not a violation --"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2241.68,2242.53,It is not a violation.
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2242.53,2243.42,-- Establishment Clause violation.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2243.42,2249.515,"The question is, do we have to come all the way to the edge of a violation, which is what I think Petitioners are arguing."
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.515,2250.11,"Yeah, I --"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2250.11,2255.66,"But it -- that it -- that as long as we aren't violating, there is no room between."
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2255.66,2267.5,"So, Mr. Layton, let's say I -- I accept that the State might have an interest in saying we just don't want to be seen as giving money to one church and not another in these selective programs."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2267.5,2268.7,And that's the endorsement side.
2016.15-577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2269.54,2269.63,Yes.
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2269.78,2273.2,I -- I think that that's legitimate. But here's the thing.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2320.47,2325.825,"Well, let me react to the way that you set that out."
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.26,2353.68,Not -- maybe not --
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2353.68,2353.83,I think --
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.83,2366.385,"-- not under -- not under Locke, right? Locke drew a distinction between assistance for devotional, theological education and scholarship and others."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2366.385,2366.77,It did.
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2366.77,2369.25,"So perhaps -- I mean, maybe you'd have a good argument."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2381.16,2387.07,I don't think that Locke raise -- I think that this case raises more serious problems than Locke in a number of respects.
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2396.07,2396.8,But here's the deal.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2433.495,2437.25,"Well, they -- they could, but that still doesn't get us out of the entanglement issues here."
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.38,2458.08,You suggested two lines. I'm back to my question --
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2458.08,2458.17,Yes.
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.17,2461.585,-- which is really quite similar to what Justice Kagan is asking.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2466.665,2467.275,Yes.
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.275,2473.82,"Now, one line you've suggested is the question that you're selecting rather than giving to any -- everyone."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2473.82,2474.9,Universal versus select.
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2474.9,2487.58,"But would you say the same case, were you to give the money to all schools instead of just some by selection, then would be unconstitutional barring churches? I don't think you would."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2511.325,2511.97,"Well, that's --"
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.97,2516.17,That's -- that's -- because you win -- you lose -- or you win on the first; you lose on the second.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2516.17,2517.05,That -- that is --
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2517.05,2520.42,"Now, they are two competing lines that I'm at least seeing."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2522.235,2532.02,"If the sole benefit to the church and its members was health and safety and we could draw that line, that may make some sense."
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2553.07,2560.69,"So it's -- it's not -- now your line is the benefit, if the benefit is physical, that's okay; but if it's not, it's not?"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2560.69,2561.13,No.
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2561.725,2569.46,"Well, what is your issue? Your -- your answer said the -- the issue here is that it's the physical area near the church."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2569.46,2569.66,No.
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2591.17,2606.345,"What if you had a program at the -- the State capital? You had tours for school groups, and you had someone who, you know, coordinated, tied it into the social studies program; school groups can come in, but no religious schools. Is that okay?"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2606.345,2611.78,"I don't know that it would be. We don't know who -- we -- we -- frankly, we have tours like that, and we --"
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2611.78,2612.885,You have to have a position.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2626.01,2630.48,"The -- the tours, at least in our experience, are also universal."
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2634.36,2634.45,Well --
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2634.45,2638.93,"-- we would be -- in terms of universal versus selective, we would be in that same range."
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2663.03,2665.37,"What -- what do you mean, ""the way it is portrayed to the community""?"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2665.37,2676.655,"Well, among other things, in -- in this particular program, the church gets points for telling people in the community that the State paid for this improvement to their church."
2016.15-577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2688.089,2695.95,"I mean, you could say the same thing, that -- that the church is delighted that it has fire protection."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2695.95,2698.58,"Well, I -- I suppose if we said -- (Laughter.)"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2698.58,2708.11,"-- we're only going to provide fire protection to churches that will declare publicly that they appreciate the States providing that, maybe; but, again, that's not selective."
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2728.36,2761.71,"And -- and so long as the money is granted based on neutral criteria that are faithfully applied, I don't know how you can draw a distinction between a program that's open to everybody and a selective program. I mean, suppose Missouri offered 50 full college scholarships every year to students who achieved certain academic criteria -- who satisfied certain academic criteria, and this was open to public school students and private school students."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2790.275,2794.88,"Well, I think that may be an Equal Protection problem, because I don't know what the -- the basis for that would be."
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2794.88,2798.19,So what's the difference between that situation and this situation --
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2798.19,2798.68,"Well, here, it's --"
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2798.68,2801.3,-- as far as the difference between selective and nonselective?
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2801.3,2811.72,"If we're going to deal with the Equal Protection approach to this, then the question becomes whether our endorsement and entanglement concerns are a rational basis."
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2811.72,2811.94,No.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2818.03,2818.24,Yes.
2016.15-577,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2818.24,2828.81,And what is the basis for drawing that distinction? I thought that -- I thought your asserted basis was it prevents the perception of favoritism.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2828.81,2831.335,"Yes, it -- it does."
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2846.43,2854.83,"But I don't understand -- I -- I think I understand how the States' interests might differ some, but essentially this is a program open to everyone."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2873.155,2882.505,"And that is what we are doing, because we are concerned about the endorsement and entanglement issues that arise in connection with this type of a program."
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2882.505,2882.82,Yes.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2898.795,2900.43,"Well, I don't know that I -- I --"
2016.15-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2900.43,2913.37,"It's a burden on constitutional right, in other words, because people of a certain religious status are being prevented from competing in the same way everybody else is for a neutral benefit."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2913.37,2925.995,"Well, this -- this is -- it's not like McDaniel where someone is being barred from participating in -- in the life of the -- the community. This is a -- kind of the opposite of that."
2016.15-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2941.28,2965.495,"Mr. Cortman -- I'm sorry. Mr. Layton, I'm -- I'm -- I know the Court is very grateful that you took up the request of the Missouri Attorney General to defend the old position, but I -- I am worried about the, if not the mootness, the adversity in this case."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2981.615,2993.52,"Well, I don't know the answer to that -- that, but let me -- let me give some of the factual background here. The Attorney General himself is recused because he actually appears on one of the briefs on the other side."
2016.15-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3009.29,3011.12,"Well, but that's the question."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3025.835,3061.68,"So -- so let me talk about what has happened and what -- what happens next. After the governor did -- made his announcement, the director, who is my client here, in fact, put up on her website the 2017 application and 2017 instructions, in which she largely tracked the 2016 and prior ones, including 2012 that the Court has, but eliminated all reference to churches, religious instruction; all of those were eliminated. That's all I know about what she intends to do, because I don't represent her with regard to that decision."
2016.15-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3061.68,3063.05,I'm asking a simple question.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3076.71,3077.95,So -- well --
2016.15-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3077.95,3082.92,"If we have no adversity, hasn't this case become mooted?"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3082.92,3101.535,"So let me -- let me tell you what happens next if the director actually grants -- issues a grant to a church. If she does, then under Missouri's liberal taxpayer standing rules, someone can then sue and say you are violating the State constitution."
2016.15-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3110.795,3111.57,All right.
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3111.57,3117.54,You -- do you agree that this -- this Court's voluntary cessation policies apply to the mootness question?
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3117.54,3119.73,I agree that they can apply to this.
2016.15-577,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3140.73,3173.58,"Mr. Layton, I'm struggling still to understand Justice Kagan's question, the answer to it. How is it that discrimination on the basis of religious exercise is better in selective government programs than general programs, first? And second, how do we tell the difference between the two, if that's the line we're going to draw? The tours, isn't it selective based on who can show up at the Capitol and afford to do that? Public benefit programs, aren't they often selective if you meet criteria? Copyright laws? You have to have an original work, things like that."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3177.23,3193.16,"Well, I -- I still maintain my position that when we have a -- a -- a case where it is a selective program that is publicly announced, publicly visible, that that is different from these other kind of programs."
2016.15-577,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3193.16,3198.365,But how do we draw the line between selective and general? One -- one could seem to play with that line forever.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3198.365,3202.225,"Well, one could, just like the rest of the lines in this case."
2016.15-577,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3204.88,3210.19,"Well, discrimination on the basis of status of religion, there's no -- no line-drawing problem there."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3212.57,3216.88,We do know that the decision here was made because it was a church.
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3224.74,3231.98,"If you -- if you make that the line, selective versus universal, if you like, you can reproduce the same problems."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3262.28,3264.23,I -- let me make --
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3264.23,3267.8,"In areas that are critical, like police, fire, health."
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3267.8,3270.27,"Police, fire, and health, when they are universal."
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3271.97,3272.3,"Yeah, I --"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3272.3,3275.15,"-- and in Missouri, that's not -- that's not universal."
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3275.15,3275.76,Of course.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3297.69,3297.78,Well --
2016.15-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3297.78,3302.105,-- constitutional line on Free Exercise? I'm afraid of that one.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3304.835,3309.14,"Well, the -- and -- and the answer would be that the line is some combination."
2016.15-577,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3365.36,3371.745,"Imagine, why would it be on the basis of a physical plant, as opposed to, say, personnel or nonphysical grant money?"
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3371.745,3373.8,Why -- why wouldn't what be?
2016.15-577,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3373.8,3380.47,Now the line is moving. Now it's apparently on the basis of whether we're granting the money to physical plant or to some other purpose.
2016.15-577,1,31466,james_r_layton,,3380.91,3414.285,"Well, no, I -- I'm saying that the physical plant is our case, because the physical plant is a -- a -- an improvement to the church property that the church will use and may use for actually proselytizing and not just use it for religious activities. And wherever the line is, that ought to be on the other side of the line, just like wherever the line is, writing a check that says payable to Trinity Lutheran Church ought to be on the other side of the line. Thank you."
2016.15-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3414.285,3418.489,"Thank you, Mr. Layton. Mr. Cortman, you have three minutes remaining."
2016.15-577,2,56090,david_a_cortman,,3418.489,3428.73,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just three points in rebuttal. First of all, as to the endorsement problem, I think the neutral government criteria here take care of the endorsement problem."
2016.15-577,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3482.77,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
