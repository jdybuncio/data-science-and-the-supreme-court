1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.84,We will hear arguments next in Connick against Myers.
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,82.541,105.018,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the case before you today is a case involving a public employee who was dismissed from service because of actions surrounding a job movement, that is, moving an assistant district attorney from one section of the court to another section of the court in the Orleans Parish criminal justice system."
1982.81-1251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.099,497.203,"Mr. Wessel, does the record show what the structure of the district attorney's office was with respect to the chain of authority below the district attorney himself?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,499.594,508.933,"Yes, Mr. Justice, there was testimony that the chief... two chiefs of trials, the chief of screening, and the training officer as well as the first assistant."
1982.81-1251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.629,530.22,--So Ms. Myers served under one of the two chiefs of trials?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,530.22,531.453,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,535.75,541.046,And the line of authority went from the chief of trials to the first assistant and then to the district attorney?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,541.046,542.621,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.621,544.793,May I just clarified one thing?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,550.244,552.478,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,617.639,623.045,"Well, isn't it fair... didn't you argue... this was argued to the district judge, wasn't it, that the transfer was the real reason?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,623.045,624.683,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.683,642.222,"And when he did not enter such a finding and only found one reason, the... and he says it in so many words, that she was fired because of the questionnaire, isn't that a... didn't he... don't we have to assume he rejected the second reason?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,642.222,646.971,"Well, Mr. Justice, there are two problems with that."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.023,679.676,"Well, that goes to whether it's protected by the First Amendment, and all the rest, but as to... his findings on motivation I thought were rather clear, that he considered all the evidence pertaining to the transfer and said that the real reason was the questionnaire."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,679.676,682.628,"--I would say that is corrects, Mr. Justice, in that regard."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.628,684.781,You are saying that that is a clearly erroneous finding?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,684.781,688.111,Clearly erroneous for several reasons.
1982.81-1251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,698.824,709.336,"Well, Mr. Wessel, I have a little trouble understanding your position in the light of your responses to Justice Stevens' question."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,716.27,734.309,"My complaint is that he... by not addressing it, he did decide it the wrong way, and of course I recognize the decision of facts on the factual underlying basis is not reviewable, but the ultimate question as to the protected activity would be."
1982.81-1251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.309,746.912,"Well, supposing in a negligence case one side is arguing that something happened on Friday, and the other is arguing it happened on Saturday, and there is a bench trial, and the judge says, I find it happened on Saturday."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,753.724,754.161,That's correct.
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.111,761.25,Suppose the trial--
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,761.25,763.142,--but it does not appear that he did.
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,765.095,770.562,"--Suppose the trial judge said, I have considered the other Pickering point and reject it, period."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,773.37,779.512,"Well, I would think the other reason for... the other reason for the firing, yes."
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,779.512,782.822,"If he said, I've considered them and rejected them."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,782.822,784.257,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,784.257,785.821,"And you wouldn't be arguing that, would you?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,785.821,788.068,I would not be arguing that except--
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,788.068,789.757,"So your argument is, he didn't say that."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,789.757,799.36,"--My arguing, Mr.... My argument, Mr. Justice, is that you can't in this sort of situation under Mount Healthy--"
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,799.36,802.562,"You mean, he has to say that... why he rejects it?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,804.843,805.795,--Correct.
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.009,862.759,"Mr. Wessel, the district judge didn't... He found the facts differently."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,862.759,863.57,--He found--
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.57,875.564,"He found that Connick told the plaintiff she was being fired because of a refusal to accept a transfer, so he was fully aware of that contention, and then he later found the real reason was the questionnaire."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,880.61,881.795,"--That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.233,887.263,You say that is clearly erroneous.
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,887.263,896.15,"--And even under the single motive... but even under the single motive case, the question has to be addressed as to whether the subject is a matter of public concern."
1982.81-1251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,912.505,914.346,"That's a separate inquiry, isn't it, from--"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,914.346,915.173,That's correct.
1982.81-1251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,915.173,916.518,--if you dealt with the motivation question.
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,916.518,942.726,"That is correct, Mr. Justice, and the first and primary point is that the... he reached the balancing or he reached the real reason, but without addressing... the trial court, I am talking about, did not address the public importance of the message or the test that should have been applied insofar as determining whether it was a matter of public concern."
1982.81-1251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.594,1011.007,"Is the initial question of whether the speech here is constitutionally protected one of a... that is a mixed question of fact and law, or a purely legal question, or what is it?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1011.007,1032.751,"Justice O'Connor, I believe that it's a legal question, and it's the ultimate question as to whether or not the expression is First Amendment protected or whether it is really a private quarrel between... involving the employee as an employee."
1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1057.973,1078.838,Don't you have to convince us... you have to persuade us that the district judge's findings generally were in... clearly erroneous because of your claim that she was dismissed for refusing to accept a reassignment within the office?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1078.838,1081.541,That is... that is--
1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1081.541,1083.464,Isn't that the narrow issue?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1088.852,1118.293,"--Not necessarily, Mr. Chief Justice, because not only could the determination or should the determination have been made upon the whole context of the transfer with the questionnaire, but even in the absence of that, if the real reason was the questionnaire, if the real reason was the questionnaire, is the questionnaire and the circulation of the questionnaire a protected activity?"
1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1158.229,1166.851,Do you contend that the district attorney had an absolute unilateral right to assign her to any part of the office he wanted?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1166.851,1169.756,"I think there is no question at all about that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1169.756,1172.178,"Well, isn't that the heart of this case?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1172.178,1179.766,"That is correct, but the setting, the setting has been ignored in the findings of the trial court."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.355,1277.024,What do you say... You talk about dual motive.
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1291.627,1314.276,"I think, Mr. Justice, at that point the balance in Pickering should be broadened, but where you had eleven out of thirteen, or eleven or twelve out of thirteen questions that pertained solely to the transfer policy, and one was thrown in as to whether or not the assistants felt that they were pressured into political campaigns."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.853,1318.869,I am not sure I understand the answer.
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1318.869,1319.805,--Well--
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.805,1324.067,You are saying the questionnaire is not protected even though one of the questions might have been protected?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1324.067,1335.407,"--I think in the abstract, had the transfer not been involved, then the questionnaire might have been a protected activity, pertaining to one question."
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.109,1353.368,"But your argument, I gather, is that the entire questionnaire was unprotected, even though it contained one question which, had it been asked separately, would have been protected."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1353.368,1356.054,That one question may have been.
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.085,1373.923,"But would not that... yes, it has to do with operation of the office, but would you not think it was a matter of public concern if the assistant attorneys were being pressured to work in political campaigns on behalf of their superiors?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1373.923,1380.485,--I do not believe the voters would turn Mr. Connick out of office or vote him into office--
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.485,1380.844,"Well, that is not the question."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1388.23,1389.588,--I don't think so.
1982.81-1251,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.588,1396.587,You don't think that the public would want to know if the assistants in the office were being pressured to work for political candidates?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1396.587,1401.801,"I don't think so, not in the non-civil service context, and this is where we are."
1982.81-1251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1401.801,1419.325,"Is it your position that in public employment, that a questionnaire sent out to other employees that addressed only the question of the activities that the employees were being asked to engage in that are political in nature would not be constitutionally protected?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1420.046,1420.405,No.
1982.81-1251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1428.493,1430.01,And if there were two questions--
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1430.01,1431.227,--it would be a matter of public concern.
1982.81-1251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1431.227,1440.785,"--And if there are two questions, that one plus one that is not of public concern, that the situation would change?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1440.785,1447.611,"Justice O'Connor, it would be difficult to answer that in the abstract, and I would probably have to yield on the point."
1982.81-1251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.809,1473.194,"Mr. Wessel, when you say that something is a matter of public concern, that, I take it, is not the end of your argument on the point, because you say even if it is a matter of public concern, there remains the Pickering balancing test to be struck."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1473.194,1474.008,That's correct.
1982.81-1251,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1574.623,1575.091,Mr. Wessel?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1575.091,1576.542,"And... excuse me, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1576.542,1578.386,Excuse me for interrupting.
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1591.052,1593.037,"None whatsoever, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1593.037,1593.957,None whatsoever.
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1599.549,1604.36,"The transfer was indicated on the week before, culminating on a Friday."
1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1640.268,1650.589,--Are you saying that the questionnaire was provoked or was a response to the transfer?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1650.589,1653.934,I think that the trial judge definitely found that.
1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.585,1670.286,"Well, is it your position that there were two reasons for dismissing her, or one?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1676.221,1699.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, the district attorney testified and the assistant testified that when she was fired, she was told by the district attorney, you are being fired for your refusal to accept the transfer, and I resent the implications of Question Number 10 or 11 in the questionnaire pertaining to the integrity of the supervisors who partook in the decision."
1982.81-1251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1699.587,1708.848,"Mr. Wessel, was there anything in the way of a rule or regulation or practice about the circulation of questionnaires during working time?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1708.848,1710.084,"No, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1710.084,1714.253,And you didn't raise the question in this trial?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1714.253,1717.673,There was no regulation.
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1717.673,1721.845,You didn't raise the question that they didn't have the right to pass them out?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1733.684,1744.63,"The judge was talking, and we were talking about whether or not Ms. Myers enjoyed a direct personal confidential relationship to the district attorney under the Pickering test."
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1747.333,1752.674,You didn't object to her handing out the questionnaire per se?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1752.674,1757.955,"--She had handed out numerous memorandums before, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.955,1759.172,And had never been questioned about it?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1759.172,1760.626,And had never been questioned before.
1982.81-1251,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1760.626,1770.823,"Mr. Wessel, your opponent makes a good bit out of Texas Department against Burdine, a case you did not cite."
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1770.823,1772.074,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1772.074,1782.35,Does that mean that you concede that Burdine doesn't affect whatever the standards were in the Mount Healthy case?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1782.35,1788.94,"We originally argued that in our petition for cert, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1822.897,1826.348,"Well, you had the privilege of filing a reply brief and didn't--"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1826.348,1827.986,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1827.986,1830.252,--Did you raise the Burdine issue before the Fifth Circuit?
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1830.252,1832.439,"No, we did not, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1832.439,1842.2,"Counsel, did you appeal from the attorneys' fees issue to the Fifth Circuit?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1842.2,1843.638,Yes.
1982.81-1251,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1875.169,1877.342,"But that was in a separate judgment, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1877.342,1880.543,"The amount was in a separate judgment, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1251,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1880.543,1882.091,From which no appeal was taken.
1982.81-1251,0,46564,william_f_wessel,,1882.091,1884.197,The issue of... No appeal was taken as to the amount.
1982.81-1251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1906.127,1913.388,Mr. Strickler.
1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,1913.388,1930.351,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Judge Gordon, the trial judge in this case, conducted a full evidentiary hearing in this matter."
1982.81-1251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1984.079,1992.919,"Do you agree with what your friend suggested, that the transfer notice preceded the questionnaire?"

1982.81-1251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.159,2213.424,I really don't think that's a fair characterization of his argument.
1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,2220.358,2254.046,"Well, Your Honor, Justice Stevens, the reason I'm saying that is because the Petitioner seems to make... base his whole argument on a distinction between matters of ""public concern"" and matters not of public concern, and I perceive his argument to be that on a matter where an employee is speaking internally, within the office, on a matter not of public concern, that that is a matter outside of the First Amendment protection, and that Pickering shouldn't even have been applied there."
1982.81-1251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2254.046,2263.888,"Insofar as it goes to running an office, that the person in charge of the office has a right to discharge someone for making disruptive comments in the office that don't have any particular public value."
1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,2266.762,2287.379,"Well, if that's the thrust of the argument, Your Honor, I certainly would not disagree that the content of the questionnaire, whether it affects a matter of great public concern or only a very narrow internal matter, is a relevant circumstance to be weighed in the Pickering analysis."
1982.81-1251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2331.439,2331.844,Mr. Strickler?
1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,2331.844,2332.453,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-1251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.453,2335.951,What if the questionnaire had contained only Question Number 10?
1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,2342.904,2392.978,"Justice Rehnquist, I would have no way to say what the district judge would have done in that case, but I think clearly if the questionnaire had only been directed to the confidence in that he... under these circumstances, he would have found it protected, and the reason I say that is because four of the five persons mentioned in Question 10, these middle level supervisors, as the personnel testified, they were all called as witnesses by the defendant, none testified that in any way was their working relationship with Ms. Myers in any way poisoned or interrupted or would be interrupted in the future by this questionnaire."
1982.81-1251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2392.978,2395.146,Did they testify that it wasn't?

1982.81-1251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.532,2411.672,"Well, if they weren't asked, I would think the implication from their testimony was simply that it wasn't asked."
1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,2434.241,2435.786,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1982.81-1251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.387,2463.259,"Well, why should he have consulted with them?"
1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,2482.455,2514.085,"--Your Honor, in the Pickering case itself where this branch of the law started, the school superintendent and all the members of the school board testified without contradiction that they thought that letter written by the school teacher, Pickering, was incredibly damaging to the future ability of the school board to raise money, to get its bond selection out, and so forth, and this Court said there wasn't a shred of evidence of that."
1982.81-1251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2526.125,2536.775,"Well, Chief Justice Taft long ago said that judges should not rejected as judges what they know as people, and I think there is an element of that in the case."

1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,2614.419,2643.341,"I believe, Your Honor, that as you said, you... no one should ignore what is common sense, and any time that there has been a discharge in any kind of employment there are going to be some acrimonious feelings about that, and when the employee, the rejected employee files suit to enforce his or her rights, there is going to be some ill feeling about that."
1982.81-1251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.452,2781.193,Do you think it was just mere accident that the questionnaire was circulated during the same time... during the same period of time that a transfer was being talked about?

1982.81-1251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.159,2796.546,So it was her... circulating the questionnaire was in response to suggestions that she be transferred?
1982.81-1251,1,26058,george_m_strickler_jr,,2796.546,2812.104,I believe the record does reflect and the district judge found that the transfers and the manner in which the transfers were announced was what started the ball rolling.
