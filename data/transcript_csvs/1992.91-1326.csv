1992.91-1326,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.606,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-1326, the District of Columbia v. The Greater Washington Board of Trade."
1992.91-1326,0,21194,donna_m_murasky,,16.093,18.628,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-1326,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,234.868,242.106,Is that because you can provide health insurance coverage without having an ERISA plan?
1992.91-1326,0,21194,donna_m_murasky,,249.544,258.317,My understanding is that Governments and churches are exempt from ERISA coverage.
1992.91-1326,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,263.971,275.279,"So if an employer, say, having 15 people simply wants to cover his employees with health insurance and buys a group insurance policy, that's covered by ERISA."
1992.91-1326,0,21194,donna_m_murasky,,275.279,275.812,Yes.
1992.91-1326,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.231,309.333,"Well then, it does seem that the statutory scheme here does impinge on ERISA-covered plans in almost all cases in that the employer's liability must be determined by the contents of the plan, and any time he changes or she changes the plan in any way, the extent of liability under the statute changes."
1992.91-1326,0,21194,donna_m_murasky,,316.17,320.622,"--I don't believe it does, I think for essentially two reasons."
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1637.289,1639.158,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.237,1664.756,"That's an interesting suggestion, the word discriminate."
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1670.326,1671.876,"--The... no, not--"
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.876,1673.878,"I don't mean under the plan, under the Workmen's Compensation scheme."
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1673.878,1674.412,--Yes.
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.314,1678.782,So that if you pay higher wages to your employees you'll have to pay higher benefits.
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1678.782,1679.099,"--Yes, which--"
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.099,1682.884,So that's discriminates against employers who pay high wages.
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1682.884,1686.186,--But not based on the ERISA-covered plan.
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.422,1694.29,"Well, it's anybody who gives health benefits, not just ERISA-covered plans."
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1694.29,1696.742,"--Yes, but health benefits are an ERISA-covered plan."
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1696.742,1700.278,But you could give health benefits without having an ERISA-covered plan.
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1700.278,1700.928,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.928,1704.265,Couldn't you buy insurance for your employees without having an ERISA-covered plan?
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1704.265,1707.217,But that insurance is a covered ERISA plan.
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.653,1743.057,"Yes, but what if, say, they figured the premiums for the health benefits were 10 dollars an hour for the employees, or something."
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1754.78,1756.28,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.736,1820.973,"Well, that's the same idea... they also wouldn't pay higher wages, because they might have to pay higher Workmen's Comp."
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1820.973,1834.399,"Yeah, but the connection is direct, and that is that the employer knows, every time I change my covered health insurance, or self insurance, it's going to cost me money in my Workers Compensation scheme, so sure, if it was--"
1992.91-1326,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.399,1836.499,"If you raise your wages the same thing's true, too."
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1836.499,1843.338,"--But the wages are... will be... well, first of all the wages would be a general application statute not specific to ERISA."
1992.91-1326,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.338,1846.456,I think your answer is that Congress wanted to encourage health insurance plans.
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1849.408,1851.592,"Well, the... yes."
1992.91-1326,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1941.882,1950.572,Suppose a State says that all employers who have more than 20 employees must provide health coverage with the following minimum benefits--
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1950.572,1961.861,"They could do that, because then there'd be no connection to the covered ERISA plan, and in an employer's mind... well, first of all, it would meet the statutory language so therefore it would--"
1992.91-1326,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1961.861,1970.533,"--Well, in each case you'd have to examine the ERISA plan to determine whether or not it met with the requirements of the statute, so there would be a relation--"
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1970.533,1972.251,"--I don't think so, Your Honor--"
1992.91-1326,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1972.251,1983.709,"--In that sense because under the hypothetical statute you would be immune from liability... suppose there was a punitive sanction for refusal to do this, you'd be immune from liability depending on an interpretation of the ERISA plan."
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,1985.995,1987.211,"--Your Honor, maybe I misunderstood your question."
1992.91-1326,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1997.284,2003.105,You have to give health benefits which meet the following specified minimums.
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,2003.105,2006.825,"Yes, and the State in its Workers Compensation law specifies what those minimums are."
1992.91-1326,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.825,2008.259,That's not Workers Compensation.
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,2013.912,2015.347,"Oh, irrespective of Workers Comp?"
1992.91-1326,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2015.347,2015.797,--Yes.
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,2022.334,2025.869,"Then that statute would be preempted, because the giving of those benefits--"
1992.91-1326,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.869,2030.171,So a State cannot require that of all employees... of all employers.
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,2030.171,2032.523,"--Irrespective of work injuries, they cannot."
1992.91-1326,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2071.731,2081.087,Do we have to accept that my hypothetical would be preempted in order to rule in your favor in this case?
1992.91-1326,1,34983,lawrence_p_postol,,2081.087,2081.337,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1326,2,21194,donna_m_murasky,,3452.483,3453.935,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-1326,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3644.125,3645.125,"Thank you, Ms. Murasky."
1992.91-1326,2,21194,donna_m_murasky,,3645.125,3646.425,"--You're welcome, Your Honor."
1992.91-1326,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3646.425,3647.325,The case is submitted.
