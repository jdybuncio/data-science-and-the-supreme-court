1968.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.728,"Number 705, Joseph Q.Cipriano, appellant versus City of Houma, et al."
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,29.176,34.044,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,175.254,183.305,"Under the law of simple majority of the property owners is sufficient, is it?"
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,183.305,188.895,"Under the law, it is required Your Honor that there be a majority in both number and amount as we shall point out."
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.895,189.957,I was -- I didn't --
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,189.957,198.136,"In number of the taxpayers, voting and a majority of the assessed property owned by those taxpayers who are actually voting them."
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,198.136,198.98,That wasn't clear.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,198.98,200.163,Yes sir.
1968.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.98,461.028,Do you really think that you'd be making the same argument with this with general obligation fund?
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,461.028,472.039,"I don't believe it's necessary for me to go that far, Your Honor, in the sense that we can show here that there is absolutely no relevancy and no possibility of attacks being used."
1968.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,472.039,477.323,But some of your arguments really are applicable to the general obligation fund?
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,477.323,479.43,They may be Your Honor to both.
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,556.551,559.986,"Mr. Harper, are these bonds been issued and sold?"
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,559.986,560.627,Sir?
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,560.627,563.398,Have these bonds been issued and sold?
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,563.398,565.462,"No sir, Your Honor."
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,580.541,594.144,"What in your judgment -- suppose we should agree with you, what in your judgment would be the effect -- might be the effect of our adjudication upon outstanding revenue bond issues?"
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,594.144,609.445,"Well, without wishing to presuppose any judgment which the Court may run, I will suggest as we have in our reply memorandum Your Honor that if this Court were to agree with us that it may limit, if you will."
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,660.975,683.878,"In other words, you think that when it comes to constitutional decision that we might make could in the first place be made non-retrospective and in the second place that would not disturb vested rights where at least where the time for challenge and the state law had passed."
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,683.878,689.617,I think the Court clearly has the authority to give its decision to that effect.
1968.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.914,715.524,I suppose that in other kinds of situations we have just recognized haven't set aside elections.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,715.524,716.124,Sir?
1968.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.124,725.147,"We haven't in some cases set aside elections, once they've been held even if they were held under an unconstitutional apportionment plans."
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,727.784,729.033,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.642,760.515,"Oh, I understand."
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,763.923,764.928,"Well, where the elections --"
1968.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.928,766.485,And bonds have been issued.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,766.485,770.99,Where the bonds have been issued as we have spoken with Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.453,790.134,"We don't need to do it in terms of retrospective effect of the constitutional decisions, do we?"
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,790.134,791.77,I'm sorry sir?
1968.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.77,797.289,"We don't need to do it in terms of retroactivity or prospectivity, do we?"
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,797.289,800.265,I'm not sure Your Honor that at which time you may have to do it.
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.148,871.173,The richest man in town might not own any real estate at all.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,871.173,879.843,"That is correct sir but if this rich man owns real estate, he is given a weighted vote."
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.387,1061.74,You see a fact of this new Texas statute.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1061.74,1062.236,Sir?
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.236,1066.016,The subsequently enacted Texas statute.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1066.016,1067.823,"Well, Act 33 of the special session --"
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1067.823,1069.692,That's the one.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1069.692,1070.545,We maintain has no --
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.545,1072.332,"I'm sorry, I beg your pardon, Louisiana."
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1072.332,1079.036,We maintain Act 33 of the Special Section of 1968 Your Honor has no bearing whatsoever upon this case.
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1148.497,1150.522,Why would it be unconstitutional?
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1150.522,1151.558,Sir.
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1151.558,1153.959,Why would that statute be unconstitutional?
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1179.264,1180.879,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1181.148,1191.343,And I suppose that your argument is that where they do require a vote that vote has to be across the boards and without discrimination.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1191.343,1204.549,"We agree with you Your Honor that it would not have been necessary for the State of Louisiana probably to require an election but under Harper, once an election is granted, once the franchise is granted, it must be consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment."
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1204.871,1220.571,"So that if the State of Louisiana here had passed an appropriate statute, presumably and there had been no election, then your position would be different with respect to the force of that state statute, would it not?"
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1220.571,1223.103,"Unless, --"
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1223.103,1229.262,"If there had been no election and no election authorized, no election called for by law."
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1229.262,1229.927,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1968.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1229.927,1231.462,Your position would have been different.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1231.462,1237.688,Once the fourth -- once the election of franchise is granted half of demands that it be granted in lines consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1239.163,1261.343,Well then the -- if you're correct and if that would nullify the election that was held and this statute of your State of Louisiana says that the governing body may proceed with the issuance and sale of the bonds whether or not the election is a valuable action.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1261.343,1262.941,But I point this out to you Your Honor.
1968.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.256,1344.688,"Well I suppose your clients are interested in voting against the bonds, aren't they?"
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1344.688,1350.93,"That is correct, sir."
1968.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1354.308,1354.996,You may.
1968.705,0,34019,kenneth_watkins,,1354.996,1357.501,Thank you.
1968.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1357.501,1359.555,Mr. Huppenbauer.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1359.555,1363.276,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.705,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1541.557,1550.181,"Has this town already have a municipally owned and operated gas, electric, and water works and its (Voice Overlap) bond issue to expand it?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1550.181,1551.746,This is purely for expansion.
1968.705,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1551.746,1552.623,Not to create it?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1552.623,1556.297,"Not to create it, correct."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.318,1700.001,Do you consider the election outside the Fourteenth Amendment or not?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1700.001,1701.83,We consider it outside the Fourteenth Amendment.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1704.166,1707.647,You mean that the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply to this election?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1708.781,1724.575,"We feel like, in view of the decision of Harper which states only invidious discrimination or arbitrary discrimination is repugnant to the Federal Constitution where the states are still permitted to classify."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1731.257,1732.066,So you do?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1734.848,1736.33,This does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.33,1739.943,"The question was, did you agree that the Fourteenth Amendment had to be applied to it?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1739.943,1740.74,It could be applied.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1741.162,1743.407,It had to be?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1743.407,1745.044,It had to be but then we feel that there had been no violation.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1745.044,1747.097,You have to comply with the Fourteenth Amendment.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1748.003,1750.129,"Yes, we have to comply with the Fourteenth Amendment."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.129,1758.24,Do you think you have complied with the Fourteenth Amendment when you say that one of the requirements for voting is the owning of property?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1758.24,1762.859,We feel in this instance it is because we're not voting on an essential governmental purpose.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1764.291,1768.709,"Well, it does not in the sense of governmental purpose, how can you get it at all?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1770.476,1772.356,This is a private business of the city.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.205,1775.99,A private business of the city?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1775.99,1777.221,Correct sir.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.337,1778.554,That's not private.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1778.554,1780.259,"It's -- no, it's public but it's a quasi."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.259,1783.168,"While it is public, it is under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1783.168,1783.989,"Correct, sir."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.989,1787.437,And you can't put up a property qualification for voting.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1789.167,1793.049,Harper says you cannot discriminate invidiously.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1794.937,1796.242,"Well, how could he?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1800.968,1802.339,Correct but that was a dollar --
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1802.339,1805.18,"What, that's -- that's only what?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1808.891,1809.867,"I'm not aware of that, Your Honor."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1809.867,1810.446,You should.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1815.999,1823.38,"But the tax here does not go to the qualification of voting, the tax here is a revenue producing tax that goes to the benefit of the city."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.146,1864.879,It could possibly affect this taxpayer's property?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1864.879,1866.087,Very definitely.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.087,1870.984,"And the one that didn't own real property, his money is in trouble too, isn't it?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1870.984,1871.895,Not necessarily.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.895,1874.246,But he could be?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1874.246,1879.058,To the extent that there may be surplus derive from the operation and utilities that could possibly be so.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.058,1883.129,So he has no right to vote on what might happen to his money?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1883.129,1885.068,That's correct in this instance.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1885.068,1886.812,And you don't think that's discrimination?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1886.812,1891.481,"No, because we feel like this is not within the purview of Harper."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.527,1893.028,"Well, Harper --"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1894.62,1896.07,Harper meant money but the money went to the --
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1896.07,1898.033,And what's involved here?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1898.033,1898.542,Sir?
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.542,1900.14,What's involved here?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1900.864,1914.525,"Here is only a veto power of a segment of the community which we feel has a very peculiar and pecuniary interests in the utility system, rather than the general public itself."
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1914.525,1916.594,Who pays for the utilities in Houma?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1917.984,1918.971,All citizens pay for the utilities.
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1918.971,1921.801,"Who pays, the tenant or the landlord?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1921.801,1923.016,The tenant or the landlord depending upon the lease --
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1923.016,1924.255,I said who does at Houma?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1926.721,1930.12,"In most instances, I would be sure that the tenant must pay for the --"
1968.705,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1930.12,1930.27,Alright.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,1930.27,1935.098,"But the rates are fixed by the Government itself, the elected officials."
1968.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1975.817,2000.916,Might there not be a temptation on the part of the property owners to have a higher rate for these utilities so that it would make a profit and the general fund would benefit from it and thus reduce their taxes and in that manner cast the burden on the people who are not property owners?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2000.916,2004.042,That certainly would probably one of their desires but still the --
1968.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2004.042,2009.489,"Well, isn't that the reason that provision is in the Act?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2009.489,2010.383,I don't believe Your Honor.
1968.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2033.419,2035.442,But everybody has to pay for it though.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2035.442,2035.807,Correct.
1968.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2055.985,2059.349,But they are very cognizant to tax rates too.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2059.349,2061.063,They're very cognizant to tax rates.
1968.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2061.063,2071.096,And who knows what temptation there will be to keep the tax rate down or to keep the utility rates down.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2071.096,2077.027,But we can extend this doctrine to a point where why not have a corporation permissible to vote?
1968.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2104.872,2113.919,What is the peculiar interest of a property owner over and above that of a tenant so far as -- so far as rates are concerned?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2113.919,2116.662,We are not really concerned with rates here Your Honor.
1968.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2148.149,2153.212,I'd like to get back to something that Mr. Justice Stewart asked you.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2166.339,2171.455,It operates -- there is a segment of that utility company very definitely operating in the city.
1968.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2171.455,2176.836,Does the city have an electric system of its own?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2176.836,2178.326,The city has an electric system.
1968.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2181.418,2190.063,"So that part of the purpose of this bond issue was to acquire the remaining 10 or 20% of the facilities serving the city, is that correct?"
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2190.063,2191.8,"Correct, Your Honor."
1968.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2229.127,2241.413,Now was there a contest that Louisiana Light and Power -- Power and Light participated in election hearing that took place before the election was held?
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2241.413,2248.346,The Louisiana Power and Light Company took an active role in trying to defeat the elections by public relation very definitely.
1968.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2258.604,2265.947,But I do see that the appellant here is a qualified voter.
1968.705,1,22474,eugene_e_huppenbauer_jr,,2265.947,2267.522,He is definitely a qualified voter.
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,2828.422,2829.388,May it please the Court.
1968.705,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2911.74,2911.818,Well you?
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,2911.818,2914.567,"In this case, the questions have not become from final."
1968.705,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2917.475,2931.371,Can you tell us whether every state has a finality period for contesting a bond issue that finality period that is measurable in months rather than years?
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,2931.371,2933.559,"No, sir I can't offhand tell you that Your Honor."
1968.705,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2955.444,2965.896,"Well, I'm sure of that but if it were in terms of years, a decision such as your request might very well be extremely disruptive --"
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,2965.896,2966.71,I would only suggest that --
1968.705,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2966.71,2971.419,-- of a great deal of money.
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,2971.419,2979.426,"I would only suggest that the question of years is an old probability not in play here Your Honor, as who would want to wait years before they can sell a bond."
1968.705,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2997.787,3000.045,"So this is a pretty small town, isn't it?"
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,3000.045,3002.408,"A town of about 35,000 people now, Your Honor."
1968.705,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3002.408,3010.544,And Louisiana Power and Light has about what 10-20% of the electric system.
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,3010.544,3012.58,"I would estimate that, Your Honor."
1968.705,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3012.58,3017.539,There must have been much revenue here at stake.
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,3017.539,3030.776,"Well, the question is this Your Honor, if we go into that phase of it, not necessarily a question of revenue at stake but as we discussed earlier, this is a question of possibly using revenue in lieu of taxes and not giving the majority of people a right to vote on it."
1968.705,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3030.776,3032.116,"No, I'm not talking about that."
1968.705,2,34019,kenneth_watkins,,3038.878,3050.223,"Well the real interest of that company, I couldn't say Mrs. Cipriano does work for him but we do have 6,000 other plaintiffs, this is a class action."
