1977.76-1382,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.66,"We will hear first this morning 76-1382, United States against Scott."
1977.76-1382,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,10.009,12.938,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,1728.804,1733.638,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1382,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1933.436,1948.323,"Of course that is a distinction all right, but there is also another distinction and that is that, in Lee, prosecutorial error was present and here there is no prosecutorial error, is that not correct?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,1948.323,1958.639,It depends how the Court decides to look at what prosecutorial error is.
1977.76-1382,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1965.526,1968.732,"Well, certainly no prosecutorial error during the trial?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,1968.732,1970.363,Certainly not.
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.363,1987.498,"Really, other than a verdict of acquittal, any other motion is going to be based on some sort of prosecutorial error, as Justice Blackmun described it, is it not, or prosecutorial misconduct, delay, improper search or seizure, or something?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,1987.498,1999.428,"I think that is true except for the situation where, of course, the Court itself makes an error, but basically, of course, it is based on my opponent making error in the case."
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.486,2042.09,But it is corrected at the sacrifice of your client’s interest in having his fate determined by first jury?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2042.09,2047.039,"Well, first of all, let me say I am not necessarily saying I agree with the Lee decision."
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2047.039,2048.793,"Well, you do not have to agree with any of them?[Laughter]"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2048.793,2065.635,"But I am saying, Justice Rehnquist, that I think we have a stronger case here for that reason because the Lee decision did involve an error by the prosecution that could be corrected, this is not the case here."
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2086.306,2099.268,"Well, the government’s argument here is that what it conceives as the error committed by the trial judge too can be correct, if it can just argue it to the Sixth Circuit on the merits?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2099.268,2103.505,"With all respect, I think we are confusing the error that I am talking about."
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.911,2135.434,Why should that be critical for purposes of the Double Jeopardy analysis?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2135.434,2149.003,I feel it should be critical because the decision in Lee and the decision in Dinitz which the government in this case attempts to rely upon seems to suggest that we somehow had a choice.
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.864,2165.72,"You did, did you not?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2165.72,2170.487,I do not think it was that sort of situation and here is why I think it is different.
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.144,2204.184,"But you preferred to have the trial judge dismiss the indictment on pretrial delay grounds than go to the jury and have its verdict and make your motion on pretrial delay grounds afterwards, the juror returned a verdict of conviction?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2204.184,2211.392,I preferred to have the judge decide my motion for dismissal prior to jeopardy being attached.
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.653,2235.582,"Well, and there is some reason for a trial judge doing that, is there not?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2235.582,2237.583,There certainly is.
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.625,2380.896,"Suppose you make before a trial two motions, one to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the statute is unconstitutional that purports to authorize the indictment for this crime and secondly that in any event, the statute does not reach the facts contained in the indictment that the statute does not cover this charge and the judge reserves both motions, but during trial you urge him to grant either one of them and he grants one or the other or both of them."
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2383.333,2386.066,"As to the first motion, I would not."
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2394.731,2402.171,"I know, but he does terminate the trial and he does not think that you can ever be retried?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2402.171,2406.286,"But the question in that case is, does the judge have to know the facts of the case?"
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.942,2422.326,"He thought he did, that is why he waited."
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2434.636,2436.796,I am not sure which decision the court is referring to.
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.837,2439.34,I am not referring to any.
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2448.394,2458.734,My position would be different and it is going to depend on whether or not the judge sua sponte at that trial decides that now he is going to decide the constitutional question whether I renew the motion.
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.734,2459.847,You renew the motion?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2459.847,2464.92,"Well, if I renew the motion at that point, I think I would have to revert to my position in this case."
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.072,2487.436,"If under a state procedure, you can make such motions during trial and they never were made before trial, but you make them during trial, what then?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2487.436,2493.561,"Well, I can see a divergence of opinion with regard to the Court on that issue."
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.323,2497.276,What is your opinion?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2497.276,2516.718,"Well, in my opinion in that situation I would still say that if I have been put to the test of the triers of fact that if a jury has been paneled and jeopardy has been attached and it is not a manifest necessity situation or mistrial situation, which it clearly is not, then I would submit that jeopardy would attach."
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.718,2519.595,Even though you were the one who urge the dismissal?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2519.595,2535.584,"That is right, but I emphasize to this Court that that is not the situation that we have here and I do not think it is fair to judge me on those sorts of facts because I made that motion prior to trial and I made it because that is when it was proper --"
1977.76-1382,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.584,2544.631,"In my example, if the judge said to you “Well, I had just been reading the Supreme Court opinions, I am afraid I would be in trouble if I granted these motions."
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2564.089,2566.555,It certainly would under the Wilson decision.
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2578.916,2590.541,"What happens if a case like this, and after all the evidence is all in, the judge says “I have held this motion up, I am now ready to decide it."
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2607.057,2612.697,I do not think it would be an entirely different case for this reason because I think the judge did make comments to that effect.
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2632.733,2652.931,"Well, I have to give some respect to the second point, but some of us have tried some criminal cases and is it not perfectly common that the defendant “disremembers,” is that not normal?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2652.931,2663.335,"Well, I am sure I do not have the experience that the Court has in that regard, but I certainly have been faced with situations where the defendant does not have a memory."
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2663.335,2676.684,"As I understand the government says that the fact that this went in and was carried over, it really goes back to the original motion and that nothing transpired?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2676.684,2684.338,I do not believe that that part of the case is clear because the judge said in his pretrial order “the motion is denied.”
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2684.338,2686.777,That is the trouble I think you have?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2686.777,2688.52,He said “the motion is denied.”
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2688.52,2690.88,"If it is unclear, you might not win?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2690.88,2717.592,"Well, he indicated the motion was denied and he said in that that it was denied without prejudice and my point in raising that part of the whole sequence of events is to point out to this Court that I am not the counsel that you were faced with in Lee or that you were concerned with in the Sisson decision that might arise who waited till I was in jeopardy to use it as a sword."
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2717.592,2742.808,"What if you have a motion for directed verdict on the issue of entrapment at the close of all the evidence, something which could not possibly have come up before jeopardy attached and the judge grants that motion, is that appealable or not under these statute making appealability dependent upon Double Jeopardy?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2742.808,2744.758,It would be my position on entrapment.
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.096,2748.975,"No, but is it right or wrong?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2748.975,2763.128,"It would be my position that since facts were heard which goes to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and he was put to the test as indicated in Green and in the other decisions, that that certainly would bar appeal of that."
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.806,2778.392,Even though there was no possibility of ever obtaining a ruling on that issue prior to jeopardy attaching?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2781.667,2782.566,That is right.
1977.76-1382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2823.576,2838.642,Do you say that the court could have then as fully advised in responding to your pretrial motion without any evidence before him as he was after he had the evidence before him?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2838.642,2843.979,Absolutely not and I think the government and I are in agreement on this respect.
1977.76-1382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.127,2884.729,"Do you suppose it is possible that among other things, in postponing a ruling on the motion the judge took into account the fact that your client was a police officer who was presumably trained to remember the facts, and therefore, this delay might be different with respect to him than for some other person, not a police officer?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2884.729,2888.471,"I know the judge took that into account, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-1382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2911.385,2919.084,Then why does that not bring you very close to the situation that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has just postulated to you?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,2919.084,2919.999,I am not sure.
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3093.495,3106.691,"Mr. Marietti, on the acquittal point, you cannot get an acquittal in your case as I see it because if your original motion had been granted, he would not have been acquitted."
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3109.963,3111.162,That is true.
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3112.928,3119.145,"By a trial, I think you do not have to show an acquittal, could you not make that position?"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3119.145,3130.031,"Well, I take the position, Justice Marshall, that once the judge denied our motion, our motion was over and we were placed in jeopardy at that point."
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3130.031,3131.612,But you renewed your motion?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3131.612,3133.673,"We certainly did, where else can we renew the motion is the problem?"
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3133.673,3137.574,(Voice Overlap) with the motion for dismissal?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3137.574,3138.078,Pardon me?
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3138.078,3140.432,Was the motion to dismiss the indictment?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3140.432,3142.294,It certainly was.
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3142.294,3144.81,So the motion he granted was the motion to dismiss?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3144.81,3154.005,The motion that he granted in all fairness to the position of the government in this case was the motion to dismiss the case for pre-indictment delay.
1977.76-1382,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3154.005,3167.339,"If someone takes a position that they are not going to bury just on language alone, are you not too in agreement that they are both the same, you do not need the word “acquittal?”"
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3167.339,3168.961,I agree completely with that position.
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.218,3201.694,Lee was going to have to face trial again too?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3201.694,3233.992,"I understand that, but in Lee, I think in that case the Court took note that it was clear that the judge did not contemplate that this man could never be convicted of these offense because the judge said in Lee, in his decision he said “look, the evidence of guilt is here, but the information is drafted improperly” and I think the Court in Dinitz also said the same thing because they gave the defendant an opportunity to retain further counsel in the case if he granted as a mistrial."
1977.76-1382,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.19,3334.986,There will be no sandbagging in the case of waiting on a motion for pretrial delay since there will be nothing that could be done during the trial to correct the government’s pretrial delay as you commented?
1977.76-1382,1,45567,william_c_marietti,,3334.986,3350.832,"Well, I would think that the government should have some prior notice of the defendant having to present this motion or is going to present it at the conclusion of the case because they certainly want to bring these factors out in the testimony of their witnesses."
1977.76-1382,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3429.013,3430.417,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?"
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3430.417,3433.432,"Just a couple of things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-1382,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3501.347,3505.23,How can you correct this delay?
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3507.931,3509.67,That is a very important point.
1977.76-1382,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3526.575,3534.911,"But you agree there is no way to correct a prosecutorial delay if there is, in fact, a prosecutorial delay?"
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3534.911,3537.916,I agree wholeheartedly with that and that is exactly my point.
1977.76-1382,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3542.895,3559.168,"Your point, I take it, is that the government is entitled to have the Court of Appeals decide whether a delay of four-and-half months is, if that is what it was here, in these circumstances is a delay warranting the dismissal?"
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3559.168,3571.576,"Yes, I think the respondent was entitled to have that issue decided in connection with his trial, but what I am suggesting to the Court is that the decision should have been after verdict if he wanted to avoid the risk of two trials."
1977.76-1382,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3573.759,3577.516,I think you are saying now what you were starting to say when you were interrupted.
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3604.671,3605.66,Absolutely.
1977.76-1382,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3619.377,3621.308,"But he is supposed to say “no, do not grant my motion."
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3627.824,3629.425,"No, not “do not grant it.”"
1977.76-1382,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3643.526,3649.054,I think it takes good amount of self-restraint on part of the defense counsel?[Laughter]
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3649.054,3665.06,"If defense counsel appreciates the possible cost in terms of a second trial, remember Rule 12 (e) says that these kinds of motions are not to be deferred for disposition during trial, if that would compromise the appeal rights of the government which if we lose here, it certainly would."
1977.76-1382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3671.954,3684.788,"Mr. Frey, if the government’s submission is accepted and putting aside mistrial situations which are a little bit special, does the time at which the jeopardy attaches have any further significance?"
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3685.633,3691.963,"Yes, it has great deal of significance under Serfass."
1977.76-1382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3697.806,3701.837,"You will say that then the time of attaching jeopardy will not make any difference anymore, I do not think?"
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3701.837,3706.132,It makes a difference for two kinds of situations.
1977.76-1382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3741.896,3745.523,But that is all the mistrial situation.
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3767.042,3779.922,"If the defense was entrapment, if the defense was what Justice White suggested that the statute is unconstitutional, you get into very difficult questions as to whether what you have is really an acquittal."
1977.76-1382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3790.045,3796.28,All I am saying is that on all those issues it does not matter what the time of placing the man in jeopardy make.
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3799.893,3806.671,"Yes, it makes a difference because if the ruling is prior to the attachment of jeopardy, then there is no even inquiry into Double Jeopardy."
1977.76-1382,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3857.389,3866.108,"What if you need to know when a fact occurred to decide whether the statute of limitations had run, that would be just like pre-indictment delay, I suppose, the government could appeal it?"
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3866.108,3869.4,We would take that position.
1977.76-1382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3887.355,3892.054,"Mr. Frey, I still do not understand your position with respect to Jenkins."

1977.76-1382,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3969.955,3979.671,"Whether or not he did, the Court said further proceedings were necessary?"
1977.76-1382,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3979.671,4002.736,"Yes, but the fact that in Jenkins the Court may have said whether or not this was an acquittal, the fact that further proceedings are necessary bars an appeal does not answer the question about Lee because, in Lee and in the mistrial cases, it is also true that you do not have an acquittal, but you still have to make the inquiry into whether an appeal on the second trial was justified."
