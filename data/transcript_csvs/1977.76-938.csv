1977.76-938,2,37174,norman_leonard,,2808.977,2811.776,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2967.272,2978.616,"Well they are not in the same unit though I mean if you went to the Labor Board and to be certified, who would not be certified-- the units certified would not include these non members."
1977.76-938,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2978.616,2989.512,"Mr. Justice White, that is precisely the question, and precisely the reason why this is not a matter for Federal Maritime Commission jurisdiction."
1977.76-938,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.58,3028.794,"Well we have the United States here, this Mr Solicitor General represents the United States, I suppose and the Department of Justice is responsible for administering antitrust laws, represents other agencies of the United States and I take it that United State's submission is that the antitrust issue -- they are preferably willing to have the antitrust issue and the labor issue decided in the first instance by the Maritime Commission."

1977.76-938,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.824,3037.884,I understand that is not.
1977.76-938,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3037.884,3061.075,"The question that you raised I submit Mr Justice White raises a very subtle significant and important question of labor relations, precisely what would the National Labor Relations Board do when confronted with the situation where there is a single employee bargaining unit interchangeable employees and if you will, two separate of employer bargaining units."
1977.76-938,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3082.431,3091.749,"Well does not the CAB do much that same thing, with respect to airline that the Federal Maritime Commissioner is here claiming a right to do with respect to shippers?"
1977.76-938,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3091.749,3100.076,I do not have enough familiarity Mr Justice Rehnquist with what the CAB does in labor relations to answer your question.
