1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.67,We will hear arguments next in Hudson v. Louisiana.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,10.956,12.224,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5688,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,82.402,90.239,Did that court have Burks before it when it decided the case?
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,90.239,98.595,It did when it decided the writ of certiorari on the specific issue.
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,104.581,108.969,"Justice Dennis begins his dissent with a citation to Burks, does he not?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,108.969,109.835,That is correct.
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.741,131.249,"Well, we take our State procedure and state procedural remedies as we find them in this Court."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,148.094,157.466,"They do treat it, but they treat it on the same basis as this Court discussed in Jackson v. Virginia."
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.172,221.143,"Well, then you would have to disavow Justice Tate's concurring opinion, wouldn't you?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,221.143,222.659,"Yes, I would."
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,284.649,300.076,"Well, wasn't he saying in the alternative I see no evidence whatever, but if I'm wrong on that then my fallback position is, there was not evidence beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,300.076,302.111,--That's correct.
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,303.478,320.406,"Mr. Burst, isn't that even ambiguous, because can't one read that to mean, either not sufficient evidence from which a jury could have no reasonable doubt, on the basis of which a jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, or not sufficient evidence to convince me, the judge, beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,320.406,321.156,--I think that--
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.156,325.46,"I mean, you could read it either way, couldn't you?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,325.46,327.828,--I have to just take the words as they're spoken.
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.545,329.612,"Well, which way does it mean?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,337.601,340.553,"--Well, I have two answers to that question."
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,359.781,363.851,Did they have authority to enter a judgment notwithstanding verdict at that time?
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,363.851,364.835,In '75.
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,366.27,379.528,"Well, at the time of this trial, couldn't the judge at the end of the trial have said what he said to himself here, and therefore I am entering judgment for the defendant of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,380.88,381.83,"No, sir."
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.037,399.172,But Justice Tate had been a member of that Court for many years.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,406.592,409.444,--I'm not sure I understand your question.
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.444,424.037,"Well, I mean, it seems to me he is saying that what the trial judge did is to say that the question the trial judge answered was the one posed by Justice Stevens or by the Chief Justice."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,434.343,436.959,"Well, that would be the second part of my answer to Justice Stevens."
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,457.956,469.946,"Well, then you're saying, I take it, that a statute which required a judge to submit this question to the jury when there was in fact no evidence, would in itself be unconstitutional."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,471.146,472.898,"No, sir."
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,527.283,540.774,"You have to treat his statement, then, as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out, as a statement that no reasonable juror could reasonably find guilt on the evidence, don't you?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,540.774,543.726,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.684,585.903,But he granted a new trial.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,585.903,591.056,"Yes, sir, and the existing law, at that time, in even the State I'm from, that was the law."
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,638.52,653.53,"Well, in a motion for a new trial for error in the admission or rejection of evidence, is there a waiver of any double jeopardy claimed there?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,653.53,668.891,"No, sir, because double jeopardy does, as this Court clearly set out in Burks, that that is not a jeopardy question, where it's an error of law, and where it's simply both sides need a different, or a new chance to put on and correct that error."
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.11,867.918,"Mr. Burst, what if the trial judge had explicitly relied on Subsection, Subparagraph 5 of Article 851 in granting the new trial?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,872.87,874.238,"That is accurate; yes, sir."
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.726,887.046,But you do disavow the concurring opinion in the rehearing?
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,887.046,887.646,--It's totally in the brief.
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.133,909.245,"Well, as Justice Stevens suggests, that his statement can be understood to mean that he as a so called 13th juror was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,909.245,919.767,"Well, the... at page 8a of the Appendix, I believe it is, he starts out, the trial judge fixes the issue himself."
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,924.505,926.021,Where are you reading now?
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,926.021,926.855,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,929.257,930.158,Okay.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,930.158,934.893,And this is where the trial judge is discussing the motion for a new trial.
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.675,996.2,"Well, if the trial judge didn't do it here, certainly the Supreme Court of Louisiana didn't do it here."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,996.2,1006.156,"The Supreme Court of Louisiana takes the position that under their laws that exist, they cannot review a decision unless there's a finding of no evidence at all."
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1006.156,1030.104,"Well, so you have to rely on the trial judge's conclusion to support your hypothesis that when a judge declares that no reasonable person could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that is the end of the case as far as double jeopardy, because certainly it is not the position of the Supreme Court of Louisiana."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1030.104,1032.906,"At this point, that is accurate."
1980.79-5688,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.085,1052.286,"Well, that's true of 49 other states too."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1052.286,1052.969,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5688,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1070.415,1073.033,"Mr. Burst, you did not try this case?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1074.25,1076.152,"--No, sir, I did not."
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1086.974,1112.591,"What if this truly were... and I think you have just told us you don't think there's any difference if it's a 13th juror basis on which a new trial was granted, or a basis of a finding that there was insufficient evidence to convince any reasonable triers of fact beyond a reasonable doubt."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1123.114,1129.52,Perhaps I am confused with this Subparagraph 5--
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.52,1133.072,That you would not be making this claim?
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1135.274,1135.674,--That's correct.
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1143.26,1163.858,"In other words, one can imagine a state... I doubt that there is one, but there may be... which said that anybody convicted of a criminal offense in a trial court is entitled to a new trial as his right, just to entitle them to two bites at the apple."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1173.297,1177.166,"I would say that that would, one, that they'd have to determine, and I'm not--"
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.166,1184.303,He simply relies on that state law that entitles him to a second trial if he's convicted at the first trial.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1184.303,1185.321,--No double jeopardy?
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1185.321,1186.271,None at all.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1186.271,1189.071,That's correct.
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.071,1197.527,And wouldn't the same thing be true if the new trial were granted under Subparagraph 5?
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1197.527,1199.862,I thought that was the question.
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1199.862,1201.381,"Yes, it was."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1203.481,1206.934,"In Subparagraph 5, the court made a finding,"
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1213.088,1214.121,"""May not be entitled to a new trial. """
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1214.121,1214.704,"--""May not be""."
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1216.29,1216.99,Right.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1240.572,1243.724,"I would have to look at that specific statute, Your Honor."
1980.79-5688,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.446,1255.515,"Well, the defendant would hardly use it as a subterfuge."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1255.515,1256.015,That's correct.
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.521,1267.573,"Unless, in fact, there were no evidence in the record of guilt."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1279.714,1283.499,If the trial judge concluded that there was no evidence at all--
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.499,1284.732,He doesn't conclude anything.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1305.929,1312.433,"--I think the test often is what the finding, the ultimate finding of the court, is."
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.433,1321.355,"You mean, if the judge says, it's a new trial under Section 5 in the interests of justice, there could be a new trial, even if the state put in no evidence of guilt at all, didn't put a single witness on the stand?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1321.355,1323.724,"No, that's what I would... that was my point in answering."
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1336.048,1338.916,"So the test is what the record shows, not what the judge says?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1341.951,1343.334,"No, I didn't say that."
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.334,1344.084,"Well, what did you say?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1346.467,1348.202,"No, I don't ask for it both ways."
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.052,1350.468,"Well, what do you say?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1351.654,1370.881,"What I say is, when at some point, when the judge of whatever system it is, in this case the State of Louisiana, when the judge who sits on the issue makes his finding and that finding becomes final through either appeal or lack thereof, that that's what we have here at this Court and that this Court is not to review the record."
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.881,1375.235,"No, but what if his finding is, I'm granting this motion under Section 5 in the interest of justice."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1400.918,1407.255,"First of all, I would take exception, and I do take exception, to Justice Tate's going into the record on an issue of law."
1980.79-5688,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.255,1407.805,"Well, I understand."
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1411.274,1411.857,It's final.
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1411.857,1416.393,"But you conceded that the judge's comment was somewhat ambiguous, did you not?"
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1416.393,1424.533,"Only to the point of whether or not he was finding no evidence, or on insufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt."
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1424.533,1426.416,Let me pursue that with one more question.
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1448.899,1450.465,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5688,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1450.465,1452.065,Just because he disagrees?
1980.79-5688,0,38707,richard_o_burst,,1452.065,1478.448,"If he is willing to make the ruling under the then law... as he did in this case, and that is subject to appeal; you know, it couldn't in this case but in future cases it could be... I realize that Louisiana has a problem right now, if this Court follows my ruling, but that's Louisiana's problem if their structure is not in line with the U.S. constitutional requirements."
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1696.151,1701.369,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5688,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.158,1797.83,"Do you agree, Mr. Bullers, that at the time of this trial the trial judge had no power whatever to direct a judgment of acquittal?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1797.83,1799.365,"--Yes, I agree with that, Your Honor."
1980.79-5688,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1800.915,1809.908,"Even if he did find that there was no evidence whatsoever, the extent of his power was to grant a new trial as a matter of judgment of the court."
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1809.908,1810.566,"--Yes, sir, that's correct."
1980.79-5688,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.131,1832.737,"Could a defendant after the receipt of a guilty verdict, without moving for a new trial, appeal his conviction?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1832.737,1834.087,Yes.
1980.79-5688,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.263,1880.798,You keep saying the trial judge injected himself in.
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1885.436,1886.436,Pardon?
1980.79-5688,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1886.436,1890.404,You keep saying the trial judge injected himself into the trial.
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1890.404,1891.14,"Well, what I said was--"
1980.79-5688,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.14,1893.974,"Do you really mean that word ""injected""?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1893.974,1895.574,--Interjected.
1980.79-5688,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.574,1896.826,Do you mean that?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1896.826,1904.913,"No, I said, what I meant was, to what extent should he be required to get into the decision process when you have a jury trial?"
1980.79-5688,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1919.44,1920.609,"No, I heard you."
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,1920.609,1921.475,--Right.
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.355,1996.773,"Mr. Bullers, can I ask you another question about Louisiana procedure?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2004.86,2005.795,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2005.795,2015.318,And he also had a duty in advance of... he had to submit the case to the jury even if he thought there was insufficient evidence to go to the jury?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2015.318,2024.09,"The way that our Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 778, was at that time, it would only be by trial judge alone, of course."
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.708,2032.362,"And what about at the end of the prosecutor's case, could he have granted directed verdict at that point in the proceeding?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2032.362,2033.462,"No, he couldn't, Your Honor."
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.462,2041.302,"So if he thought there was no evidence of guilt and that there'd been a total failure of proof, he would have had to do exactly what he did in this case?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2041.302,2041.685,Exactly.
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2081.06,2094.603,Is there anything at all in the record that supports Judge Tate's view that... and I know he's an awfully good judge and usually is pretty careful about what he does... but is there anything in the record to support his view that the judge relied on Section Five?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2094.603,2097.639,"No, Your Honor, the judge didn't state that."
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.864,2140.065,What is the status of your procedure now?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2143.267,2145.119,"Well, it's still as it is now, is my understanding also."
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2145.119,2146.002,--It's still the same way?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2146.002,2146.502,That's right.
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2146.502,2158.777,"If your procedure allowed a directed verdict, and the district and the trial judge entered a verdict of not guilty notwithstanding the judgment, would you say that would bar another trial?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2161.229,2166.116,There would be a finding of not guilty and in essence it would bar another trial.
1980.79-5688,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2166.116,2170.501,"--So we just look at the judge's ruling in that case, and we wouldn't really look at the evidence at all?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2177.171,2178.005,Do you have any other questions?
1980.79-5688,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2178.005,2186.009,Then the State has no appeal from an order granting a new trial?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2186.009,2192.848,"No, Your Honor, there is no appeal or review by the State, once the judge orders a new trial then we'd have to proceed on with a new trial."
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.903,2217.646,But then you defended... after the second trial you got in your licks on whether the new trial order was right?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2217.646,2221.098,"Well, after the second trial, he was convicted again."
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.098,2221.798,Then he appealed.
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2221.798,2223.95,And then he appealed and raised this issue.
1980.79-5688,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2235.275,2239.56,Was there new evidence presented in the second trial that was not present at the first?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2239.56,2239.927,Yes; yes.
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.082,2253.069,"Well, are you defending the Supreme Court of Louisiana's rationale for its decision?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2255.505,2259.557,I think that Judge Tate's rationale was probably the most accurate.
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.557,2262.675,Under Burks or what?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2262.675,2263.611,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.235,2279.754,Do you agree with him?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2279.754,2280.671,"Yes, I do."
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.671,2290.928,"Shouldn't we remand it, then, for the Supreme Court to apply the right standard and determine whether there was double jeopardy?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2290.928,2292.028,That is a possibility.
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.913,2303.85,"Well, if you agree with Tate, what else can you do except remand?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2314.472,2319.942,"--His theory, as I said, appears to be the most accurate."
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.35,2333.885,"They just misread Burks, you think?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2333.885,2335.185,Well--
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.185,2337.087,"Or do you agree with that, or not?"
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2337.087,2340.706,"--Of course, that is our Supreme Court, and those are learned gentlemen down there, Your Honor."
1980.79-5688,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.706,2345.593,And you hesitate to appear before them after having?
1980.79-5688,1,29341,james_m_bullers,,2350.145,2351.247,"No, that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5688,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2391.556,2393.424,I think not.
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2399.327,2401.346,"They will be very brief, indeed."
1980.79-5688,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.443,2430.347,"But did he say any more than that, if he had been a member of the jury, he would have voted the other way?"
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2430.347,2431.199,He certainly did.
1980.79-5688,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2431.199,2431.999,"Oh, you think so?"
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2431.999,2435.151,I certainly think he did and I specifically refer the Court to his reasoning.
1980.79-5688,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.151,2443.59,But an experienced trial judge should have articulated it more precisely if he meant what you say he meant?
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2443.59,2444.673,"Well, I think he did."
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2446.208,2447.608,The Supreme Court of Louisiana certainly agreed with you.
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2447.608,2448.577,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2448.577,2451.077,The Supreme Court of Louisiana agreed with you.
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2451.077,2452.296,"Yes, they did."
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2452.296,2454.564,Agreed with your reading of what the trial judge says.
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2454.564,2456.18,"The majority did, yes."
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2456.18,2458.266,Rightly or wrongly.
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2458.266,2466.705,"But I... you know, I think he does say more than that, and in fact he does specifically reference three of the other grounds and... as I recall."
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.661,2513.583,"Or as a matter of state law, the Supreme Court has, never reviews the sufficiency of the evidence, I gather."
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2513.583,2514.2,That's right.
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2514.2,2516.202,"That's a matter of the state statute, isn't it?"
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2516.202,2521.522,That's a matter of... I think it is statute by interpretation of the Constitution.
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2521.522,2522.638,I just read it here; yes.
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2522.638,2523.872,That is correct.
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.507,2534.411,"In other words, the Supreme Court of Louisiana has no power to review the sufficiency of the evidence, as a matter of state law."
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2534.411,2536.996,"They could, by interpretation, though."
1980.79-5688,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2545.119,2549.504,"If they say that's what their Constitution means, that's what their Constitution means, as far as we're concerned."
1980.79-5688,2,38707,richard_o_burst,,2551.29,2552.84,I understand.
1980.79-5688,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2554.658,2555.308,Thank you.
