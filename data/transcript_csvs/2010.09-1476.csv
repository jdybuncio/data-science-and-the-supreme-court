2010.09-1476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.213,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1476, The Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,11.083,13.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,60.696,67.387,You agree that the Petition Clause is -- is different and does have a separate content?
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,67.387,82.359,"--Your Honor, we agree that the Petition Clause -- that when the Petition Clause and the Free Speech Clause cover the same activity, they apply -- they cover it under McDonald in the same way."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.359,91.183,"But the Speech Clause, in the employment context, has been interpreted to cover the content."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,95.136,98.341,One part of that inquiry turns on the content.
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,98.341,103.37,And you want the Petition Clause also to turn on the content?
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,103.37,107.431,"Part of the inquiry, yes, Your Honor, should turn on the content."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.431,112.507,But it seems to me you're either petitioning the government or you're not petitioning the government.
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,131.087,132.004,"Well, the--"
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.004,140.767,Which wouldn't necessarily break out the same way as whether it's a matter of private concern versus a matter of public concern.
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,140.767,163.88,"--Your Honor, this -- under the constitutional background principles this Court has developed, this Court should look at -- looks at how close to the core a particular example of employee activity is, and then talks about how much of a burden that kind of activity poses to the efficient operation of the workplace."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.88,168.936,But the core -- the core of the Petition Clause is petitioning.
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,192.654,197.464,"That is right, Your Honor, just as most examples of speech concern private matters, too."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.778,238.967,"That's true, and it seems to me the -- the core is involved whenever you're asking for a change."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,259.245,267.277,"Well, Your Honor, in practice, that inquiry would not align much differently than the Connick inquiry."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.277,269.766,"It may well be, may well be."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,269.766,281.188,"And in this particular case, designing a kind of threshold inquiry along those lines would actually advantage Petitioners."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.992,312.002,Would they have to do both?
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,312.002,313.063,"They might well, Your Honor."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,331.208,341.108,"If you're proceeding with a claim under two separate provisions of the Constitution, it should not be surprising that you might have two different tests."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,341.108,353.541,"--Well, Your Honor, then that might argue for more reengineering of the rest of the -- the enterprise as well, a step that this Court has not identified as appropriate under--"
2010.09-1476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.541,374.462,Why would it make -- why would it make a difference at what you call the balancing stage whether it is -- whether the distinction is between public speech and private speech on the one hand or government as employer and government as sovereign on the other?
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,377.298,392.283,"--Well, Your Honor, if at the first stage the Court is running an inquiry that is something different from Connick, that is not going to map onto traditional Pickering balancing, at least as this Court has described it, at the second stage."
2010.09-1476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.283,392.704,Why not?
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,392.704,420.623,"Because, Your Honor, Pickering balancing has gone to things like how -- how -- how important that particular example of speech is, how close it is to the core of what the First Amendment protects, and then that is weighed against the kind of burden it would place on the government to have that activity protected in a very strong way."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.623,446.3,"I think all you're saying is that one of the elements of Pickering balancing is the element of Petition Clause jurisprudence, as I suggested it -- it might be applied; that is, in Pickering balancing, certainly you have to ask, was what the individual was asking for a change in employment conditions?"
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,462.005,472.975,"Well, Your Honor, if this -- if this Court were to proceed down that road, Petitioners, I believe, would still end up victorious."
2010.09-1476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,497.923,507.542,"What kind of case, hypothetically, would qualify under your theory as a petitioning case to the sovereign?"
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,513.176,521.906,"It would depend upon the particular claims involved, or statements in the petition."
2010.09-1476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,547.088,549.671,Doesn't that get to the -- to the merits of the case?
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,575.145,583.084,"--Your Honor, a petition to the employer about changing the hours of employment--"
2010.09-1476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.084,584.005,Those are clear cases.
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,584.005,584.551,--for overtime--
2010.09-1476,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,584.551,586.463,I was asking the flip.
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,586.463,587.149,--The flip.
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.588,613.59,"Of course, you have to wrestle with the same problem if you apply the other test that you -- you were proposing."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,613.59,614.288,For sure.
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.288,618.26,"Namely, whether it's a private matter or a matter of public concern."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,620.546,629.869,"You certainly do, Your Honor, and presumably this Court would look at some of the same factors involved there: The form, the content, and the context of the communication."
2010.09-1476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,647.873,660.806,"Mr. Ortiz, you're not drawing any line depending on the branch of government, in other words, executive, legislature."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,672.93,679.469,"A lawsuit, pursuing a lawsuit, is definitely a form of petitioning activity, Your Honor."
2010.09-1476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,681.583,693.879,"What about the -- this as I understand it, came up originally as arbitration under the -- wasn't it under the collective bargaining contract?"
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,693.879,695.467,"Yes, Your Honor, that is the case."
2010.09-1476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,695.467,700.369,"Would that count also, because it is a mechanism set up by a government employer?"
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,700.369,706.39,It would qualify under the original conception of what a petition is all about that was in this case.
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.154,739.881,"If -- if lawsuits are covered by the Petition Clause, why is it that in the innumerable cases this Court has had concerning what due process of law consists of, we've never mentioned what the Petition Clause requires."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,756.082,767.66,"Well, Your Honor, that might be explained by the fact that the Due Process Clause has been interpreted more robustly and supplies a certain floor of constitutional protection for lawsuits."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.361,789.047,"Maybe that's all they had in mind, or petitions to the executive as well."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,794.586,825.478,"--The evidence is that developed by Professor Andrews, and the argument is a somewhat slender one that goes as follows: At the time of founding, Congress was the central sort of clearinghouse for petitions and handled both what we think of as the stereotypical paradigmatic petitions, pleas to Congress to sort of change the law, and also handled a lot of private bills."
2010.09-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.532,845.241,I agree with you that that's slender.
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,845.241,848.104,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.09-1476,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,848.104,852.2,"But you are not challenging that, as I understand."
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,852.2,853.757,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,898.233,900.304,"Mr. Ortiz, can I try a hypothetical on you?"
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,929.125,932.098,"Yes, Your Honor, it would be protected for two different reasons."
2010.09-1476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,939.147,939.599,Really?
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,954.759,961.559,"--It's not employment-related or related to his particular job, and this Court has always drawn the distinction there."
2010.09-1476,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,966.182,976.519,"I see, so that goes back to Justice Scalia's difference test, which is it's not a matter of public concern versus private concern, but it's a matter of employment-related versus not employment-related, correct?"
2010.09-1476,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,976.641,982.106,"Well, that shows how closely those two things have been related in this Court's approach."
2010.09-1476,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1151.106,1152.07,"Thank you, Mr. Ortiz."
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1160.195,1163.059,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1476,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1184.145,1193.172,How much of your argument is premised on the fact that there was an alternative mechanism to the court system available.
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1193.172,1194.186,--That certainly--
2010.09-1476,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1194.186,1208.94,"Meaning let's assume there wasn't a collective bargaining agreement, let's assume there wasn't a State law protection, all of the items that you mention in your brief as existing to resolve disputes, that the only avenue for redress were the courts."
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1212.111,1217.701,"--Well, it's a hard hypothetical to answer, of course, because the grievance was filed pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement."
2010.09-1476,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1217.701,1218.196,Putting it aside.
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1229.635,1230.941,"Well, I think that's an important part--"
2010.09-1476,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.941,1236.75,What was the meaning would -- it is harder if all they have access to is a court proceeding.
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1236.75,1250.942,"--I think that's an important part of the argument, for this reason: If you look at the Third Circuit's case in San Filippo, the court had a kind of a doctrinal basis for its ruling, but it also had a practical concern that not affording protection for this kind of petitioning activity would be a trap to the unwary."
2010.09-1476,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1262.38,1262.985,How about if they don't?
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1262.985,1265.54,--It typically -- well--
2010.09-1476,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.54,1266.379,How about if they don't?
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1269.757,1289.864,"--Well, then I think the -- the result is the same, and -- and our position is you -- you still apply Connick, just as speech on matters of private concern is protected by the First Amendment, yet under Connick, an employee who engages in speech on a matter of private concern is not going to be protected in the employment context in all respects."
2010.09-1476,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1351.835,1352.753,Mr. Palmore -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1352.753,1354.121,"--No, please."
2010.09-1476,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1354.121,1371.505,"Suppose a State legislature passes a law depriving all State employees of collective bargaining rights, and a State employee files a lawsuit saying that this law violates the State constitution, and the State employee is thereupon fired."
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1374.06,1379.491,"It -- it likely would be, and I think this -- this goes to some of the questions Justice Scalia was asking."
2010.09-1476,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1415.751,1425.555,"And suppose -- now going back to Justice Sotomayor's example, suppose that there were a -- a class action alleging systemic discrimination in some governmental workplace."
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1427.641,1429.291,It very well might be.
2010.09-1476,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1461.896,1476.635,Do you -- can you think of any instance where speech by the employee would not be protected under the Pickering-Connick free speech calculus but would be protected under the Petition Clause?
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1476.635,1483.996,"I think that, no, if you put it in that way; this Court has never separately analyzed the two."
2010.09-1476,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.889,1520.833,"What -- wouldn't a -- a written letter to -- to the employer, the government employer, similarly be a petition?"
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1535.103,1543.682,"I -- it's -- I think it's a serious question about whether a letter submitted to an employer as an employer, not as a sovereign, is a petition."
2010.09-1476,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1591.412,1624.404,"Mr. Palmore, what about the distinction that the other side brings up that Connick is about what happens inside the workplace -- you don't want to disrupt the routine by the kind of activity in which Myers was involved -- but the Petition Clause, they're talking about conduct outside the workplace, that is a complaint filed in court, nothing that's happening in the workplace."
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1624.404,1629.088,"Well, I think it's workplace-related and I think that's the test."
2010.09-1476,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1685.829,1688.212,"Mr. Palmore, on that matter, one last hypothetical."
2010.09-1476,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1713.379,1714.857,It very well might be.
2010.09-1476,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1755.451,1756.384,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1760.012,1761.783,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1801.469,1814.869,"But all of our cases have equated the Petition Clause reach with that of the First Amendment, and our cases under the First Amendment have made clear that we don't want to constitutionalize the -- the employee grievance procedures."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1814.869,1825.905,"--Well, with all respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think this Court is committed to the view that the Petition Clause and the Free Speech Clause cover exactly the same things."
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1833.949,1837.609,Does the Petition Clause cover anything that the First Amendment does not?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1837.609,1839.146,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1874.739,1878.18,"Well, getting back to the second part of my question--"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1878.18,1878.539,Yes.
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1878.539,1885.136,"--in the First Amendment cases we were concerned about, as I said, constitutionalizing employee grievances."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1891.829,1908.042,"Well, it -- it's our view, Mr. Chief Justice, that -- and in this respect to some extent I think we agree with a statement made by Petitioners -- that every gripe that an individual employee might have, indeed most of them, wouldn't be covered by the Petition Clause."
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1917.772,1924.497,All you have to do then is add a sentence to your complaint saying: This is an example of how the government employer mistreats its employees?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1924.497,1926.147,No.
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1926.147,1927.469,And then it becomes more generalized?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1927.469,1928.916,"No, no, Your Honor."
2010.09-1476,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1936.716,1940.714,"What if added to that is ""and I'm going to sue"" or"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1942.52,1947.205,"--No, Your Honor, saying that wouldn't have that effect."
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1976.853,1980.341,"Well, under -- under the First Amendment speech clause--"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,1980.341,1981.57,--Yes.
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1981.57,1992.712,"--We have said that an employee's, public employee's, right to speech can be regulated, can be confined, can be restricted beyond what the State could do for a nonemployee."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2000.358,2001.634,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2002.274,2006.366,"Then you have to offer a test and you don't want the public concern test, so what's your test?"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2006.366,2033.459,"--The, the -- that it, the government's interest as an employer is part of the calculus if -- if this issue arose under the Petition Clause, and under ordinary balancing one would look at the nature of the government's interest and the degree of burden that's imposed, and that's the way the Court has administered the Petition Clause."
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2033.459,2038.159,"And you would be content to apply that analytic, broad analytic framework to the Petition Clause?"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2038.159,2041.21,"Yes, that's what the Court has done."
2010.09-1476,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.889,2087.851,"Well, let's talk about it."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2122.263,2133.029,"--Your Honor, the -- the Federal Government is not obligated to provide a -- a lower court system for -- authorized to hear suits against it."
2010.09-1476,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.029,2134.743,I'm not talking about just a lower court system.
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2140.578,2141.293,It can.
2010.09-1476,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.099,2162.71,You're saying that the Petition Clause only covers those petitions that the government chooses to allow; is -- is that what the constitutional guarantee is?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2173.573,2184.403,"--No, I think -- I think historically that -- that's a fairly accurate description of what has happened with the emergence of the Petition Clause over the last 6 or 700 years of Anglo-American history."
2010.09-1476,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2238.546,2248.725,"Mr. Schnapper, you can write a letter to the president, you can write a letter to your congressional representative, but getting to a court, you have to pay a filing fee."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2260.958,2264.893,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I think those cases are clearly distinguishable."
2010.09-1476,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2293.996,2295.088,Do you -- do you think--
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2295.088,2296.349,"And so, we think those cases are distinguishable."
2010.09-1476,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2296.349,2300.456,Are you suggesting that in one of these suits you wouldn't have to pay the filing fee?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2300.456,2303.351,"No, no, precisely to the contrary."
2010.09-1476,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2330.276,2337.84,--Suppose the Borough here bought something from a company under a contract that included an arbitration clause.
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2345.682,2348.825,Yes.
2010.09-1476,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.426,2424.974,What's the earliest English or American case you have that refers to a lawsuit as protected by the Petition Clause?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2424.974,2432.307,--I'm not familiar with English law in that respect.
2010.09-1476,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.514,2439.326,How many?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2439.326,2440.882,About 40.
2010.09-1476,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.882,2442.36,40 years ago.
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2442.36,2444.164,There's precious little--
2010.09-1476,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.164,2447.729,"So for a couple hundred years, nobody -- nobody connected the two?"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2447.729,2455.276,--Many of the constitutional issues this Court deals with were not raised for -- for a very long period of time.
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.276,2469.891,"In the Garcetti case, the district attorney was disciplined for sending a memo because he disagreed with how the trial strategy was supposed to unfold, and then he actually made that argument in court and was disciplined for that."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2487.664,2489.81,"Well, it would have been a petition."
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2499.226,2505.542,Would you have objected if the same analysis were used in the Petition Clause case as in the actual case?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2507.271,2507.786,"--Right, right."
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2509.327,2512.732,"--Just white out ""Speech Clause"" and put in ""Petition Clause"" and file the same opinion?"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2512.732,2525.184,--The question I take it you're asking is -- is whether the Garcetti principle would apply to a Petition Clause case where the government -- it was part of the official--
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2525.184,2528.484,I want to know how the analytic framework differs.
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2528.484,2543.947,--I don't -- I don't think -- the specific question is whether the Garcetti rule should apply in a Petition Clause case.
2010.09-1476,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2549.955,2554.717,"Well, Mr. Schnapper, can I ask Justice Kennedy's question in maybe a little bit of a different way?"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2581.752,2591.837,Probably not in the sense that you're asking.
2010.09-1476,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2624.301,2635.724,"What if a number of municipal employees prepare a formal document called ""Petition"", and they say: We have a grievance, and our grievance is that the quality of the food in the cafeteria is poor?"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2639.009,2666.174,"As you describe it, on our view, not so, because our view is that, putting aside the historical and somewhat unusual but less common instance of a petition directed to, let's say at the Federal level the Congress or the president, the Petition Clause ordinarily applies only where the government has created a specific remedial mechanism for addressing a particular kind of grievance."
2010.09-1476,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2675.996,2677.178,Where does that rule come from?
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2679.855,2680.183,--No.
2010.09-1476,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2720.132,2733.903,"Mr. Schnapper, this is not -- if you're -- if you're talking about the practical significance, Myers in Connick was going around the office, collecting signatures."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2770.23,2770.355,--No.
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2825.4,2829.758,"Well, you're the expert in this area, but that -- that surprises me."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2847.796,2849.462,There -- there were.
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2851.731,2855.45,"And there were scores, scores of -- of signatures on these petitions."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2856.838,2861.832,"--It is, but what I'm suggesting is that is a 19th and 20th-century phenomenon."
2010.09-1476,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2922.185,2924.861,"That was the Calhoun position, not the John Q. Adams position."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2924.861,2926.075,--Right.
2010.09-1476,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2927.444,2935.898,"Mr. Schnapper, let's come to the century in which we are now living."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,2968.764,2969.279,Exactly.
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.251,3012.512,"But -- but that's the basis of our law in this area is that when the government is actually the employer the rights of the individuals are somewhat different, and they're closer to the rights that private employees have."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3026.831,3038.765,--And -- and we're not taking issue with the assertion of the government that the government as an employer has interests which are different than it -- it -- those it has just as a sovereign.
2010.09-1476,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3086.452,3096.161,"Mr. Schnapper, isn't the real question in these cases whether the employee is acting as a citizen or instead whether the employee is acting as an employee?"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3112.862,3119.728,"--With all due respect, our view is it depends whether or not the -- the employee is acting as a petitioner within the meaning of the Petition Clause."
2010.09-1476,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3195.132,3211.816,"You do, I think, recognize that it would be possible then to circumvent Connick if you could turn around and file a pleading and say: Now I have a petition, not just a grievance."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3211.816,3217.991,"--Your Honor, we don't think that that is a serious problem for three reasons."
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3248.744,3252.621,"Well, but things will be a lot different if we give the sanction to your theory."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3260.155,3265.007,"Well, I think your -- I think there are two -- two other reasons why this is not a -- a major concern."
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3320.241,3331.914,"Well, but the most likely solution when you have an employee grievance along with it is that some umbrella settlement -- I mean, the employer doesn't want to spend -- I mean, that's part of the reason our doctrine developed under the First Amendment."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3340.629,3348.084,--Few -- few private lawyers who aren't independently wealthy are going to take a baseless case on the theory that they're going to get some umbrella settlement.
2010.09-1476,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3361.25,3367.444,"Counselor, your client won everything in his collective bargaining grievance."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3385.105,3386.291,"--Your Honor, this--"
2010.09-1476,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3386.291,3393.883,"People get upset about how they're treated all of the time, and they find lawyers to file suits about that treatment."
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3393.883,3399.984,"--Your Honor, I can certainly tell you that people who are upset all the time call me ostensibly unable to find lawyers."
2010.09-1476,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3424.822,3435.562,"Your submission is there are not very many -- throughout the whole country there are very few frivolous 1983 cases or employment cases, that's your point?"
2010.09-1476,2,23226,eric_schnapper,,3435.562,3442.704,"--No, they -- they -- certainly they happen, but the notion that this is going to unleash a flood of them seems to me unrealistic."
2010.09-1476,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3477.643,3479.324,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1476,3,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,3481.598,3506.76,"Your Honor, it defies the imagination that the radical Republicans and the framers understood that the Petition Clause would constitutionalize public employee grievance, and as academic commentary that Respondent cites suggests, their -- Respondents long-centered view of the Petition Clause would call into question, sovereign immunity doctrine, parts of Rule 11, suggest a right to appeal and a right to judicial review whenever anyone has agreed to government action."
2010.09-1476,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3537.653,3539.661,"Thank you, counsel."
