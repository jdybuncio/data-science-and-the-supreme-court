1978.78-432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.713,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 78-432, United Steelworkers against Brian Weber and the consolidated cases."
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,19.799,23.312,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-432,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,298.677,301.258,"Mr. Powers, I want to be sure."
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,306.8,310.403,Kaiser does not admit past discrimination.
1978.78-432,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,345.624,347.644,"Beyond this, Kaiser does not go?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,347.644,351.138,Kaiser does not concede discrimination under Title VII.
1978.78-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,358.197,370.433,I don't know -- do you concede that the figures would have made out of prima facie case requiring Kaiser to come forward with some explanation.
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,370.433,393.426,We certainly would concede that it's arguable and I think the Fifth Circuit's decision in Parson against Kaiser which involves a neighboring plant of Kaiser to the Gramercy plant and one that is also subject to this 1974 agreement shows that courts could reach that conclusion.
1978.78-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,393.426,411.128,"Well, what I'm asking whether ultimately whether you concede that after the case, that you could not make out any defense but do you concede that the figures would make a prima facie case that would require you to come forward?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,411.128,414.841,I don't concede.We don't concede that there is a prima facie case.
1978.78-432,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.521,484.312,Of course the Bakke case really has nothing to do with this one.
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,493.142,503.565,"We believe Your Honor that, Mr. Justice Stewart that the standard is no stricter for approving race conscious action under Title VII."
1978.78-432,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,503.565,507.743,"(Voice Overlap) as lawyers and judges, it's quite different isn't it?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,511.945,513.046,It does not involve the Equal Protection Clause.
1978.78-432,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.046,516.982,It involved the 1964 Act of Congress?
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,516.982,517.582,That is correct.
1978.78-432,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,517.582,540.949,"It's pretty clear that -- it's entirely clear I suppose saying the one side the post-civil war legislation that until 1964 your client could have had a training program for all white people, all women, all Negroes, or all anything else and it's only because of this active Congress that this lawsuit arises, isn't it?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,540.949,541.786,That is correct.
1978.78-432,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.786,546.045,Nothing to do with the Constitution or the Fourteenth Amendment of it?
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,546.045,547.291,That is our position and we believe that's clear.
1978.78-432,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,547.291,548.485,(Voice Overlap) isn't it?
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,548.873,550.46,Excuse me?
1978.78-432,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,550.46,554.346,"That's not only your position, that's the fact of the matter, isn't it?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,554.346,556.747,"Yes, we agree with that."
1978.78-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,556.747,564.36,"And really the very narrow question, you could have done this as my Brother Stewart said before 1964."
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,564.36,564.482,Oh!
1978.78-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,564.65,569.216,Are they only narrow and very narrow question is whether 1964 Act forbids you from doing?
1978.78-432,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,569.216,569.945,That's right.
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,569.945,570.353,That is correct.
1978.78-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,570.353,571.62,That's all that there is to the case?
1978.78-432,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,571.62,572.146,That's right.
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,572.146,573.349,And in our judgment --
1978.78-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,573.349,575.504,Isn't that all there is to the case?
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,575.504,577.371,I believe it is all.
1978.78-432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,589.067,604.898,"Mr. Powers, supposing that the quest -- the answers you've given to my Brother White's and Blackmun's questions previously were different, that there wasn't even any arguable showing that your company had discriminated in the past."
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,611.572,629.503,We believe that Title VII may require employers to take action which prevents them from importing into their own workforce discrimination which others have -- are responsible for.
1978.78-432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.646,642.765,"But the Title VII isn't the Executive Order, is it?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,642.765,668.875,"It is not but it is our understanding that the two are to be construed -- are to be reconciled and as we read the legislative history of Title VII, the 64 legislative history, the Congress was aware that there was an Executive Order and it sought to provide that that programming including the affirmative action elements of it, would be allowed to continue."
1978.78-432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.875,682.163,"So you said that even though there -- nobody could have made out even a prima facie case of discrimination against your company in court, nonetheless this agreement was permissible under Title VII?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,682.163,685.564,What I'm -- my point is this that we think there must be --
1978.78-432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.564,687.669,"Well, can you -- can you answer the question?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,687.669,690.461,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.459,749.921,You think to the extent that creates discriminate situations or discrimination.
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,755.149,758.719,I come back to my first answer to Mr. Justice White.
1978.78-432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,784.636,793.649,"Well, the employers and union could do it, if Congress would let them do it, is that not so?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,793.649,800.399,We believe that Congress could specifically authorize this type of action.
1978.78-432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,803.073,845.296,"Suppose for example Congress had a statute which I, I will try to draft the statute here but something to this effect that provided however, applying to all existing statutes that nothing in this statutes would prohibit an employer, unilaterally or by contract with the union from agreeing to carry out a program of the kind we have here, the preferential treatment to minorities who'd been denied equal opportunities in the past in order to remedy that."
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,850.099,856.003,"Well, I suppose that legislation would have to pass the equal protection standards."
1978.78-432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,861.342,867.109,"Next, do you think that would run foul any constitutional prohibition?"
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,867.109,869.255,"Well, I mentioned the equal protection question."
1978.78-432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.047,893.333,I'm assuming from statutory recitals of past discrimination and exclusion including the longstanding union activities that prohibited minorities particularly Negroes from getting into apprentice programs or even membership in the union.
1978.78-432,0,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,893.333,895.437,We would think that would be constitutional.
1978.78-432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,900.814,912.334,"Very well, Mr. Powers."
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,913.754,917.704,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.469,1057.724,"Let me ask you this.Suppose when Title VII was adopted, there was an employer who had said to himself, I think just to be fair I'm going to have my workforce mirror the racial composition of the community in so far as blacks and whites are concerned."
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1071.311,1084.091,"No, on the contrary, we think that would be the zone of permissive action as we understand it is not that an employer and union can opt as a permanent matter forever to hire on a racial basis."
1978.78-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.98,1093.305,So you're still approaching it then as a remedy?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1093.305,1107.675,"Well, it's remedial in the sense that if a segregated workforce is a bad thing to have, it's something you ought to be able to remedy but not necessary remedial in the sense of we committed a sin therefore we have to correct it."
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1107.675,1122.425,Is there any history Mr. Gottesman of this union having done as so many unions did the Building Trades Unions for example excluding Negroes particularly from membership in the union?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1122.425,1127.648,"On the contrary, Your Honor, the history of this union is that it was built with black members first."
1978.78-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1148.574,1151.708,Throughout the union you have the Steelworkers organizing  Committee?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1151.708,1152.256,That's correct.
1978.78-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1152.256,1154.702,That was completely interracial.
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1154.702,1155.61,Interracial.
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1193.398,1203.404,There is no doubt is there that quite a number of unions have had a systematic exclusion for past years in this respect.
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1203.404,1208.634,"I think, Your Honor, it is not correct of industrial unions that there is such a history."
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.458,1245.416,"Well, have they not trained them or have excluded them from membership which --"
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1245.416,1248.73,"Well, what they testified was that they had not provided them training."
1978.78-432,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.043,1257.277,"That wasn't true of your union, I take it."
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1257.277,1262.375,"Well, our union takes into membership who the company's hire."
1978.78-432,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.006,1275.344,Union shop type of view?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1275.344,1292.486,"Well, union shop or where it's permissible and if not then whatever of those we represent them all and whoever chooses to join in most happily do but the union's membership reflects whoever the company chooses to hire and the union doesn't conduct craft training programs."
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1331.746,1339.894,Then you would agree with your colleague who just said that Congress could easily clarify this?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1339.894,1349.777,"Well, no matter what this Court decides, Congress can easily clarify it if this Court's decision does not coincide with what Congress believes to be the right result."
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1393.814,1416.41,"Under the present statute, could an employer lawfully announce and execute a program saying that he would hire approximately 50% people who had been convicted of criminal acts and were released either on preliminary parole or permanently released."
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1416.41,1424.73,"Well, this statute only prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and religion, Your Honor, so the employer is free to discriminate on other grounds."
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1424.73,1432.62,"Within that range of 50% you would get a wide range of racial groups, no doubt wouldn't you and ethnic groups?"
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1432.62,1434.187,"Sure, unless that would --"
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1434.187,1437.309,"You said, with no prohibition an employer could do that?"
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1437.309,1444.153,I would think unless it were a subterfuge for some type of invidious discrimination that this statute proscribes and --
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1444.153,1453.064,I must -- I was hypothesizing an employer who consciously and deliberately wanted to try to help rehabilitate people who had been --
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1453.064,1457.185,There's nothing in this statute to preclude that Your Honor as I understand it.
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1457.185,1460.67,Any other statute that you know?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1460.67,1468.732,I can't say that I do but I don't want to have confidence that I know all the statutes that I know all the statutes that might come into play.
1978.78-432,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1505.532,1520.586,"Mr. Gottesman, I know that your ultimate position is that this simply is not a violation of Title VII of the 1964 Act but isn't it despite what you just told us, isn't it on its face -- prima facie a violation."
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1524.442,1528.969,"Well, it is a race conscious decision which --"
1978.78-432,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1528.969,1529.748,In training?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1529.748,1533.053,It requires the selection of blacks rather than whites in certain instances.
1978.78-432,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1533.053,1533.652,Which is?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1533.652,1535.938,"In the literal sense, it is discrimination."
1978.78-432,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1536.843,1542.306,"So what you said, I assume in a lawsuit would be defensive, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1555.163,1567.38,"Well, but one could say it that way, our -- the defense would be no more though than simply saying that we have a segregated workforce and we have adopted a quota which does no more than eliminate that."
1978.78-432,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.38,1568.429,Precisely.
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1568.429,1574.019,"And that is not, once we've shown that, that is not discrimination as Congress intended that term."
1978.78-432,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1574.019,1579.394,"Well, it's not whatever it may be or may not be discrimination but it's not a violation of Title VII."
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1579.394,1580.563,Okay.
1978.78-432,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1580.589,1582.366,Is that it?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1582.366,1583.671,That -- that is correct.
1978.78-432,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.671,1586.883,How much is left of McDonald then if your view would prevail?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1586.883,1596.148,McDonald prohibits the kind of discrimination against whites that Congress passed this statute to prohibit against blacks.
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1607.767,1615.829,"What you're saying is that, under your theory you can discriminate for good motives that count for bad motives?"
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1615.829,1617.465,"Well, it's not so much the motive."
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1660.922,1671.084,Wouldn't it have been quite easy for Congress to express these concepts in the terms that I outlined in very rough suggestion of the statute?
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1671.084,1672.513,"It would have been easy, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.081,1802.881,"Well, why did you answer me awhile ago the way you did that an employer with a racially balance workforce would be violating Title VII?"
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1802.881,1804.687,"Well, I'm not sure I want to say that he would be."
1978.78-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.12,1807.723,"Well you said he was, I asked you."
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1807.723,1809.657,I may have overstated my view.
1978.78-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.452,1820.939,"Maybe but the reason the words you're reading there read on my example too, don't they?"
1978.78-432,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1820.939,1827.257,"Well, except I think if I get to the end of the quote, what Congressman McGregor said was that Congress had spelled out."
1978.78-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1952.381,1953.254,Very well.
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1959.998,1964.397,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2083.202,2097.283,"Mr. Wallace, if we accept Mr. Gottesman's position on behalf of his client, we don't need to decide whether you're right or wrong as to the extent of this Court's remedial power, do we?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2097.283,2101.028,It would be possible for the Court not to reach that issue.
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2101.028,2103.74,"That would be, perhaps it will be proper for the Court to reach it."
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2103.74,2119.148,"All of the parties are arguing on the basis of premises as to the symmetry or lack thereof between remedial orders litigated decrees, consent decrees and voluntary action can be undertaken."
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2119.148,2121.745,But that's precisely what Mr. Gottesman does not do.
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2125.159,2125.816,"Well, in his brief --"
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.816,2141.873,If he's correct then the Court need not and probably should not reach the question of what a district court could do by way of a remedial order and need not and probably should not reach the question of the validity of the Executive Order.
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2141.873,2153.834,"Well, in his brief he asks the Court to hold that the line of cases cited in footnote 14 of our brief on page 26 were wrongly decided."
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2153.834,2156.738,"But it has nothing to do with his basic position, does it?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2159.815,2163.219,"Well, I think that his position can stand without it."
1978.78-432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.586,2195.879,"Well, that dealt with testing, isn't Griggs?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2195.879,2221.109,"It dealt with testing but it said that even unintentional disparate of facts on racial groups can be a violation of the act despite complete lack of evil purpose, invidiousness, or any of the other terms that were just submitted to this Court as properly to be read in to Section 703 (a) and 703 (d)."
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2221.109,2222.175,"Well, let's assume this."
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2236.791,2238.922,"Well, we agree with the bottom line."
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2239.195,2244.943,I mean on the (Voice Overlap) obviously are under the literal language of the statute if you will.
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2258.973,2259.647,But --
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2259.647,2272.433,And then if he's correct then what possible business is it of the Court's in this case to reach the question of what with appropriate remedy be in the event of a violation of Title VII.
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2278.042,2306.44,"Well, it is difficult to decide the case in isolation from other holdings interpreting Title VII in a comprehensive way, I think it's quite true that narrowly speaking, the Court could avoid the question whether programs of this type could be approved in consent decrees, as they had in many cases or whether they could be ordered as remedies in litigated cases."
1978.78-432,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2320.465,2330.332,"In Griggs, Mr. Wallace, did it not the Court note that there was no question about any bad faith or bad motivation of the employer?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2340.107,2340.794,That is correct.
1978.78-432,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2344.124,2348.437,The case turned on the impact not on the intention.
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2349.434,2378.064,That is correct and the respondent here has submitted that the same type of prima facie case about impact on him through the use of a racial criterion that requires a response and that has been in our view rebutted by the circumstances in which this program arose.
1978.78-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.938,2518.234,Are you arguing that this collective bargaining contract violates Title VII?
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2518.234,2523.114,The -- the contract is consistent with Title VII.
1978.78-432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2554.398,2565.641,"But what you're saying is that in the case involving a voluntary agreement between management and labor, we should go ahead and decide what courts could if the matter were litigated in Court."
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2565.641,2566.985,And a violation was found?
1978.78-432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2566.985,2567.734,And a violation was found.
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2567.734,2577.743,There is a symmetry between of the relief that courts can order and of the voluntary programs that can be entered into.
1978.78-432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.743,2582.215,Why?
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2582.215,2586.679,"Because otherwise, the use of a racial criteria and presents a problem."
1978.78-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.91,2620.369,For how long your submission -- for how long may the program?
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2620.369,2628.106,"Well, this program has many features that are consistent with the proper remedial approach under Title VII."
1978.78-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.292,2665.591,"Under your view then, Mr. Wallace that when it reaches that -- when it finally does reflect the community or the composition of the workforce, may the company and the union then agree to maintain that balance, consistent with your position?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2665.591,2674.238,"Well, that would -- it create a difficult problem under Title VII that they would be turning away people from employment on the basis of their race."
1978.78-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.238,2680.493,"Well, do you care to say yes or no, it would or wouldn't violate Title VII?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2680.493,2696.192,"Well, it's hard to say just on this -- on that bare hypothetical but I will say that if a person black or white is turned away from employment on the basis of his race because the employer wants to maintain a certain balance."
1978.78-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.53,2709.603,I take it your answer is that in your present submission is that that would violate Title VII?
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2709.603,2715.997,"On the face, it's a prima facie violation and the rest it's justified there is a violation there."
1978.78-432,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.877,2731.624,And after a violation --
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2731.624,2741.728,Whether in the case of voluntary program it is a reasonable basis to think that a violation could be shown unless something was done to rectify the situation.
1978.78-432,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.728,2749.723,"But then in both sides, it may have agreed that they were operating with the segregating workforce?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2749.723,2750.919,Of course they did.
1978.78-432,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2934.464,2936.659,"You covered all that in your brief now, I believe."
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2936.659,2946.182,"Yes, and we believe that this program should be upheld as a reasonable response to the situation that the company and union were in."
1978.78-432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2946.182,2954.841,"Mr. Wallace supposing that the respondent, the plaintiff here had come in the Court alleging the same facts as he did in this case."
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2968.818,2969.623,That is correct.
1978.78-432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.623,2977.246,"Now, what -- give me an example of what sort of evidence, what tangible types of evidence they could come up with that would meet the case?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2977.246,2985.013,The very kind of evidence that I've been pointing to meets the respondent's case here.
1978.78-432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2989.784,2991.788,"Well, the -- the complaint in this case."
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2991.788,3000.454,The complaint in this case is the very evidence that I've been pointing to of the vulnerability of the employer to a suit.
1978.78-432,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3002.384,3007.964,"Well, how would you produce -- do such an evidence in Court?"
1978.78-432,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3019.573,3023.705,"Well, the evidence was produced here Mr. Justice."
1978.78-432,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3073.813,3075.07,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3093.347,3096.293,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3260.092,3266.168,I don't understand that there is any challenge to the idea that this is quota program.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3266.168,3267.153,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3268.551,3273.166,Then I have misread some of the briefs here.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3280.302,3288.272,"Your Honor, I think that the only difference is that some of the parties choose to call the quota a race-conscious program."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3318.924,3331.493,Mr. Fontham there is a -- these briefs both of the parties and amici are sprinkled with euphemisms but we can't decide this case on what something is called rather than on what it is.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3331.493,3333.494,"Absolutely Your Honor, and I think that --"
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3333.494,3343.089,And I don't think there's any equating the question of the Chief Justice as any real question or controversy here as to what this program is and what it provides.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3343.089,3344.828,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3351.631,3353.371,Discriminate against some white people.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3353.371,3359.85,"Take away not only to discriminate, Your Honor but in addition to take away and devalue accrued seniority rights."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3359.85,3360.518,Yes.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3360.518,3364.016,They had been built up over years of service to Kaiser by these employees.
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.016,3365.278,"Yes, I don't think there's any service of opinion to the --"
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3365.278,3367.583,How many years?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3367.583,3368.505,Your Honor?
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3368.505,3370.908,How many years was Weber there?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3370.908,3377.813,"Your Honor, Mr. Weber personally had been employed at the plant I believe since 1968 or 1969."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3377.813,3381.281,That's a long line of seniority you're talking about.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3381.281,3382.865,"Yes, Your Honor but the seniority system --"
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3382.865,3393.126,"(Voice Overlap) there in any event Mr. Fontham that even if Mr. Weber had not been accepted in this program because he might have, there might have been white people of more seniority than people of more seniority."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3398.901,3400.223,"That is correct, Your Honor and they are plaintiffs."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3400.223,3401.887,I think there is no controversy about that.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3401.887,3404.22,That's correct.
1978.78-432,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3410.276,3418.024,(Voice Overlap) you opened by saying that you did not think the issue is the one that phrase at the outset of this argument?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3418.024,3418.682,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3418.682,3419.957,I don't quite understand that.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3425.894,3427.256,"Absolutely, Your Honor but --"
1978.78-432,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3427.256,3428.759,That's the only question here?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3428.759,3431.773,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1978.78-432,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3431.773,3433.838,I didn't understand what you meant when they said (Voice Overlap).
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3433.838,3442.083,"Well, Your Honor, I was simply saying that I didn't -- I would phrase it differently than the way Kaiser's attorney phrased it."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3460.353,3463.595,And what evidence was there on the other side?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3463.595,3464.373,"Your Honor, the union --"
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3464.373,3466.359,"There was no evidence, was there?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3470.528,3472.134,"Your Honor, the union attempted to prove."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3472.134,3473.589,There was no evidence.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3475.795,3477.239,"The black in place at the plant, Your Honor?"
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3477.239,3481.183,The union represented both Negro and white.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3483.248,3487.235,"Your Honor, there -- there were no interveners if that's the question."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3495.339,3499.432,All that I'm talking about is the findings at these two courts.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3501.849,3503.557,"Yes, Your Honor, it was based on testimony."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3505.632,3506.978,By whom?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3506.978,3509.532,Testimony of the Kaiser officials.
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3512.924,3518.193,Do you expect Kaiser to come in and say they openly discriminate against Negro?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3518.193,3518.832,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3520.652,3522.177,Who would you expect to say that?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3522.177,3525.128,"The union tried to say that the District Court, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3528.948,3533.8,"Excuse me sir, my question was not brief, it was evidence."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3533.8,3534.197,"Well, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3534.197,3535.725,Testimony --
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3535.725,3536.197,It's the same --
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3536.197,3538.313,"No, the normal evidence."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3538.313,3548.854,"Your Honor, it's the same argument that the Government raises in this case the asserted statistical disparity which I would like to address."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3565.508,3567.671,The 2% of its employees.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3567.671,3568.729,"No, Your Honor to all employees."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3568.729,3571.828,"2% of its employees were Negroes, right?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3571.828,3574.119,"No, Your Honor just simply in the crafts."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3574.595,3575.844,"Well, that's what we're talking about."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3575.844,3576.576,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3577.273,3580.643,"With this seniority the 2%, they were craft."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3580.643,3583.368,2% of the skill craftsmen at the plant --
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3583.368,3588.342,And that's who they gave the seniority so far as the Negroes of this place?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3588.342,3594.86,"Well, Your Honor the seniority system was applicable with respect to the unskilled laborers at the plant."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3625.08,3627.084,They couldn't find the 2%.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3627.084,3627.766,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3738.307,3740.318,Do you assume I didn't read it?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3740.318,3742.013,"No, Your Honor I don't assume that."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3808.185,3808.912,Mr. Fontham.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3808.912,3809.559,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3809.559,3826.828,Let's suppose that just on the figures or on the statistics a plaintiff -- a black plaintiff could have made out a prima facie case that would have required Kaiser to put on some evidence.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3828.621,3829.772,It would not Your Honor.

1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3868.856,3870.26,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3885.456,3894.056,"No, they freely denied that -- freely they refused to admit that a prima facie case could have been laid down."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3894.056,3896.064,"Yes, Your Honor and he couldn't have."
1978.78-432,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3966.896,3969.122,"Mr. Fontham, let me interrupt you just a minute."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,3986.932,3991.152,"Okay, Your Honor, let me say, hopefully I said this was not a remedy."
1978.78-432,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4035.174,4043.866,"When you use the word remedy, do you mean you suddenly claim that a particular individual had against you for damage that you had done to him?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4043.866,4044.825,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4071.654,4072.91,By Kaiser?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4072.91,4075.195,"By Kaiser, yes, Your Honor that's true."

1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4094.949,4098.108,I thought you did (Inaudible)
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4098.108,4100.47,"Well, Your Honor, I think but --"
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4100.47,4102.157,I remember what you said before.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4102.157,4120.037,"We have in this case what is happening and what we object to is that the company and the union and the Government is assumedly have decided that the social goal which I think is a lot of social goal, uplift minority groups should be achieved."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4123.937,4127.268,Did Congress also decide that in this bill?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4127.268,4128.377,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4128.742,4129.956,They did not?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4129.956,4135.145,"Well, Your Honor, yes they did in the sense of eliminating barriers."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4156.474,4157.279,By them?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4157.279,4158.578,Your Honor?
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4158.578,4159.002,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4165.787,4170.478,"Well, I'm very sorry to hear that, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4170.478,4174.944,"Believe me, it said so."
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4174.944,4184.828,"Mr. Fontham, you perhaps, do you have in mind the hypothetical amendment to Title VII that I outlined to your friends in their oral argument?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4184.828,4185.283,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4185.283,4197.873,Do you agree that if Congress passed such an amendment or such a statute that an employer could proceed to try to achieve racial balance by programs of this kind?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4197.873,4207.807,"I think, Your Honor, that the obvious question would be state -- whether there were federal government or state action that might create a constitutional problem but in the absence of that --"
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4207.807,4211.942,"Well, (Voice Overlap) just passing statutes, state action?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4211.942,4223.325,"Well, Your Honor, the question is would the Office of Federal Contract Compliance be enforcing it but if it's not, if Congress wants to return the situation to pre-1964, I think you're absolutely right."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4657.502,4696.88,"I think that's not the union's position but I think the union's position would be that if there is a conspicuous disparity in the workforce and then that 90% or 95% or 98% of the craft employees were Negro and only 2% white, I think as I understand the union's position, it would be that the employer and the union could cooperatively and voluntarily agree to put in this kind of a program until a more representative workforce were in placed."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4696.88,4697.649,"Yes, Your Honor but I think --"
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4697.649,4699.137,Did you understand it the same way?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4699.137,4702.53,"Well, I'm not sure I --"
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4702.53,4703.617,That's the way I understood it.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4703.617,4710.515,To me there were differences between what the union argued in oral argument and in the brief but I think Your Honor that --
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4710.515,4715.725,"Certainly, the difference is between the union's position and the employer's position and the Government's position."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4715.725,4716.514,"No doubt, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4716.514,4717.395,That's very clear.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4717.395,4733.707,"I think, however, that if the union and the company did that, there's no doubt that if it discriminated against Negroes or other members of minority groups, it wouldn't last a minute in this Court or any other court, federal court virtually."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4733.707,4739.982,"You know more than I do, if you will."
1978.78-432,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4739.982,4741.181,"Mr. Fontham, --"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4741.181,4741.412,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4741.412,4752.914,What's your answer to the union's argument that 703 (j) when it says that nothing contained in this subchapter shall be interpreted to require any employer.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4761.549,4762.073,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4833.014,4838.76,You say in effect that the explicit language of (a) and (d) prohibits the drawing of the implication that the union draws from?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4838.76,4839.83,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4850.426,4856.456,"Mr. Fontham, I take it, Title VII now applies to local governments, I take it?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4856.456,4863.058,"Your Honor, it applies I know to state and local governments and I'm not sure about the extent to which it applies to the federal government."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4863.058,4864.503,"Well, to state and local government --"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4864.503,4865.062,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4865.062,4866.786,-- it does.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4886.096,4887.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4887.886,4895.995,I take it your position would be that that would violate Title VII in so far as the faculty was concerned.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4895.995,4899.12,"Yes, Your Honor, because this Court had said so."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4916.641,4934.387,"The -- the union argues that there's a tie between Title IV and Title VII, and that in the Title IV discussion it was perfectly clear that Congress wasn't objecting to voluntary decisions of school boards to integrate their faculty this way."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4934.387,4940.104,"Your Honor, I am -- I have to admit that I did not read all the legislative history of Title IV."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4966.279,4971.374,You can't avoid -- you can't avoid discrimination by discriminating.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4972.447,4976.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4976.277,4976.974,Thanks very much.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,4976.974,4980.614,I think so.
1978.78-432,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5213.683,5225.786,"Of course if there was an arguable case, the entering into this program would not have prevented any of the plaintiffs in that arguable case from suing Kaiser or the union."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5225.786,5227.248,"I think that's correct too, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5242.001,5249.391,"So in that sense, neither Kaiser nor the union by entering into this agreement immunize themselves from suits for actual discrimination."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5249.391,5260.069,"That's correct, Your Honor, but what they immunize themselves from was harassment or in their view, harassment by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance."
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5460.669,5463.557,"But we're not worried about that in this case, do we?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5463.557,5465.19,"Yes, Your Honor, that's what we do."
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5465.19,5467.663,"Well, we don't have to decide that in this case."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5467.663,5469.16,"Well, I think Your Honor that I --"
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5469.16,5471.285,You're projecting into the future.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5471.285,5477.83,"Yes, Your Honor, it is projecting in the future but I think what I want to say is that if the Court were to say that's alright."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5514.872,5523.43,"Oh that would depend, the validity of that would depend upon the meaning of subsection (j), wouldn't it?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5523.43,5525.08,"Well, Your Honor, I think the meaning of that --"
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5525.08,5525.926,Isn't that correct?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5532.941,5535.46,"Well, I think subsection (j) would indicate that --"
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5535.46,5537.524,"Now, yes but that would be the question, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5540.243,5540.701,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5540.701,5545.599,We don't have the meaning of that prohibition here because Government has not
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5545.599,5546.068,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5546.068,5546.508,-- sought to impose this --
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5546.508,5547.185,I think --
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5547.185,5547.786,-- isn't that correct?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5547.786,5555.242,I think in this case what you have is what the Government requires is the employee to do its self-analysis.
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5558.092,5560.466,But you conceded that this was a voluntary action between the lawyer and the union?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5560.466,5562.622,"Yes, absolutely."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5563.048,5570.233,"Therefore, there's been no directive or prohibition or requirement by any agency of Government in this case, isn't that correct?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5570.233,5572.004,"That's correct, Your Honor, that's what I thought."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5572.878,5580.036,"And subsection (j) only has to do with what may not be required by Government, isn't that correct?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5580.036,5582.081,"Yes, that's correct."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5582.081,5587.405,"And this case doesn't stem from anything that was required by Government, correct?"
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5587.405,5588.104,"Well, the --"
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5588.104,5589.061,It was voluntary.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5589.061,5593.753,"It was a voluntarily inactive program, that is correct, Your Honor, I agree with that."
1978.78-432,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5593.753,5594.703,Thank you.
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5594.703,5595.851,"Mr. Fontham, --"

1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5597.136,5614.227,"They correct on McDonald page 281, footnote 8, this Court said, that Santa Fe just claimed that the actions challenged here were any part of an affirmative action program."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5629.469,5629.798,"Well, Your Honor, I --"
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5629.798,5630.85,(Voice Overlap) what this Court said.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5630.85,5635.474,I recognize that that statement was in McDonald.
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5635.474,5637.366,But you did okay.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5637.366,5658.462,"But Your Honor, the -- I think it's a -- what the Court also said was that Title VII protects all individuals whether they be members of a minority group or not members of a minority group, and that those persons have a right to sue and to have a relief and to have non-discrimination on an individual basis under Title VII."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5666.579,5670.958,That you cannot pass it on affirmative action program.
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5670.958,5677.185,"Your Honor, I think that certainly I draw from that decision that rights cannot be discriminated against."
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5677.185,5679.894,Why do you think the Court put that footnote in there?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5679.894,5680.645,Your Honor?
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5680.645,5685.665,Why do you think the Court put that footnote in there?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5685.665,5686.044,I think that --
1978.78-432,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5686.044,5687.191,Dictum?
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5687.191,5697.005,"I think that the Court -- I don't know, Your Honor."
1978.78-432,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5817.713,5825.063,"Mr. Fontham, three or four times, you mentioned Senator Humphrey in your references to the legislative history."
1978.78-432,3,35844,michael_r_fontham,,5834.715,5837.421,"Your Honor, I'm not sure."
1978.78-432,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5846.34,5848.413,"Mr. Powers, do you have anything further?"
1978.78-432,4,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,5850.947,5852.44,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-432,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5889.671,5891.339,But that was not my question.
1978.78-432,4,37241,noyes_thompson_powers,,5891.339,5904.739,We think that nothing could be clear and that the Congress intended that this type of voluntary action be taken consistent with the broad remedial purposes of the statute.
