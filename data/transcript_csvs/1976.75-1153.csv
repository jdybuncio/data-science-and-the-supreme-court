1976.75-1153,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.852,"We will hear arguments next in 1153, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education."
1976.75-1153,0,41902,sylvester_petro,,62.668,69.433,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please this Court.
1976.75-1153,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.141,492.092,"Well, it said in so many words the teachers would have such an action, did it not?"
1976.75-1153,0,41902,sylvester_petro,,492.092,495.662,"I do not think you can say that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-1153,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,502.734,517.707,"I thought it said if the Union choose to spend monies that it had collected for political activities, the Court of Appeals described political activity, then an action would lie in Michigan Courts against the Union to recover."
1976.75-1153,0,41902,sylvester_petro,,517.707,522.756,That is what makes the case so extraordinarily difficult to deal with.
1976.75-1153,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,541.888,550.35,"Well, if they thought that they are giving you another lawsuit was a sufficient cure of the over breadth, if there was any, I take it?"
1976.75-1153,0,41902,sylvester_petro,,550.35,555.176,We have to win on the over breadth argument all over again.
1976.75-1153,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.176,558.541,I would not think so.
1976.75-1153,0,41902,sylvester_petro,,566.432,585.656,"Well, our problem is that we were dismissed and we think that we were dismissed in spite of the fact that we have what the Michigan Court of Appeals very largely implied was a good constitutional claim."
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1478.807,1482.71,"Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court."
1976.75-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.88,1700.766,"Under your understanding of the Court of Appeals ruling, would a particular member of the plaintiff group have to object to particular expenditures or would it be sufficient for him generally to object to expenditure of any money for any political purpose?"
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1700.766,1733.748,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I think under the holding of the Court, there would have to be a specific objection just as this Court stated in the Lathrop case in the context of constitutional adjudication, such a requirement would be necessary, at least it was necessary in the context of the complaint there, but I would respectfully suggest that is academic now because the Union has adopted the remedial process which was recommended by this Court in the Allen case as a means of facilitating ready restitution of the proportional payments in so far as they might be applied."
1976.75-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.748,1748.547,"What happens to the union member who does not particularly want to disclose his disagreement with particular union policies or political policies advocated by the union, but just does not his money spent for any particular political, activity in time?"
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1748.547,1749.341,No Your Honor.
1976.75-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.182,1760.497,"But can he then, I will go back to my first question; can he then simply say I do not want you spending my money for any political purpose?"
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1760.497,1761.554,"Yes sir, he can."
1976.75-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.554,1764.158,"And what happens then, does he get all his money back or…?"
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1764.158,1768.684,"No, he would get in accordance with the remedy of this Court and as provided by the…"
1976.75-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.684,1771.224,…by this Court in this Court in this case here.
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1771.224,1781.572,"He would get a proportional refund in so far as any payments expended by the Union for political purposes are involved, has -- total expenditure."
1976.75-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1781.572,1785.963,"How is that total computed, how you are going to compute that?"
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1785.963,1792.291,"We are going to compute it in the best of good faith and accordance with the suggestion of the Allen case, Your Honor."
1976.75-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1792.291,1793.686,Just tell me in dollars and cents.
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1798.499,1799.961,"Well Your Honor, that would involve…"
1976.75-1153,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.961,1803.943,Say 40% of your budget is political; does he get 40% then?
1976.75-1153,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1803.943,1810.229,"Your Honor, under your hypothetical for 40%, there will be 40% refund."
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3304.821,3324.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, I think thoroughly without any intention Mr. Sachs has completely misled us all concerning the posture of this case."
1976.75-1153,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3414.693,3428.107,"Well, Mr. Petro, may I just ask why then in the Court of Appeals’ opinion did they discuss the issue of retroactivity?"
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3428.107,3433.873,This was involved in the question whether or not a contract then existed.
1976.75-1153,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3450.005,3458.924,It means in other words if the contract in the record before us is different from the contracts in the record before the Court of Appeals and where you nevertheless were reviewing that decision?
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3458.924,3484.76,"No, an aspect of that contract involved in the Warczak case was controlled by force of precedence not by force of judgment in the Smigel decision."
1976.75-1153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3561.817,3565.14,Was this case filed in 1969?
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3565.14,3565.597,Pardon me.
1976.75-1153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3565.597,3568.837,Is this case filed in 1969?
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3568.837,3570.105,This particular case?
1976.75-1153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3570.105,3571.542,Yes sir.
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3571.542,3574.175,"In 1969, yes."
1976.75-1153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3574.175,3579.146,So the 1973 act applied in 1969.
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3579.146,3599.461,"No, it applied as of the time when the case came back up to us, a contract, the contract of these parties are bound by, if they are bound at all, is a contract entered by the parties after 1969 -- 73."
1976.75-1153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3599.461,3601.389,What was the date?
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3601.389,3601.547,October --
1976.75-1153,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3601.547,3607.759,"Is that contract in this record, the 73 contract in this record?"
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3607.759,3612.043,"Yes, it is in the record, let us see."
1976.75-1153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3670.071,3675.304,"What did he have to with it, did Smigel name it?"
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3675.304,3687.707,Smigel is the decision in which the Michigan Supreme Court stimulated the legislation that is involved here.
1976.75-1153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3702.978,3707.792,Did you prove Smigel up here?
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3711.452,3714.251,"Well, Smigel is not my case."
1976.75-1153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3714.251,3717.435,How does it get into this?
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3717.435,3722.303,"Well, it provides the background for the Michigan Para Amendment."
1976.75-1153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3750.446,3756.589,Go ahead and respond as to further response to Justice Marshall.
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3756.589,3787.346,"The fundamental deficiency from the point of view of the First Amendment in this case is that the Union intends to have to put it most mildly forced loans from the teachers, in order to use those forced loans to promote political causes to which the teachers must be presumed in view of their general objection, the features are opposed to them."
1976.75-1153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3804.363,3810.478,"Now, you are restating the arguments you made before us so we have that argument."
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3810.478,3813.807,"Well, it goes to the rebate procedure."
1976.75-1153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3816.286,3819.105,You have covered that sufficiently counsel.
1976.75-1153,2,41902,sylvester_petro,,3870.551,3873.922,I pray the Court’s indulgence for just one word.
1976.75-1153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3873.922,3877.243,"I know, I need no response to that."
