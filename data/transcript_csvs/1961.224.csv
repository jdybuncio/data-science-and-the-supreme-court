1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,16.989,28.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I approach this argument with some trepidation after the spirit of exchange took place with Mr. Doolittle and Mr. Dietz."
1961.224,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,132.652,136.537,How long had the administrative interpretation going on?
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,136.537,141.083,Between the years 1951 through 1956.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.121,257.533,There was a privilege of call in 30 days notice --

1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.219,258.445,-- in either case.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,258.445,259.677,-- Mr. Justice Stewart in --
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,259.677,259.988,And the --
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,259.988,260.533,Either case.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.533,262.836,-- and maturity on the other hand was several years away.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,262.836,268.521,"The maturity was in one case in 1983, and then the other case 1981."
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.521,270.158,Yes.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,270.158,289.69,"The fact of the matter is that in a particular period during which the taxpayer purchased these bonds, the economics of the market were such, the interest rate being above the current rate -- current rate being paid on these bonds."
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.06,304.529,You mean because to refinance would have cost more money --
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,304.529,305.155,In the case of the general --
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.155,305.912,-- of the issue --
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,305.912,308.622,"-- call price, the interest rate being larger."
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.3,313.536,Right.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,313.536,314.657,-- the issue.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,338.149,340.559,Rather than the retirement of their --
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,340.559,340.835,Correct.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,340.835,341.595,-- their indebtedness.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,341.595,359.361,"The fact is that in the tax year in question accept for a rather -- rather modest amount of some $184 in the appellation issue which was involved in the Gourielli case, there was no cash in the sinking fund."
1961.224,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,391.123,400.378,"It's conceded is it, common ground between you that -- that what the -- that 1953 is the decisive year for determining this?"
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,400.378,402.4,Yes Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.167,422.407,"And the Government does concede a good deal of your case actually, doesn't it?"
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,422.407,428.294,The Government concedes that we were entitled to deduct the difference between what was paid in the general call price.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,428.294,428.601,Because --
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,428.601,428.887,What --
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,428.887,434.575,-- the bonds were purchased within 30 days at the end of the year and there was -- these were callable on 30 days notice.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,434.575,437.776,That is correct.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.41,455.795,It has subsequently --
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,455.795,456.784,It has indeed.
1961.224,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.661,496.165,"Well the government doesn't argue that, does it?"
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,496.165,510.448,"No, but I think this is important Mr. Justice Brennan to know that aside from the -- my second point which I was coming to is that the special call provisions that were included in these bonds were not tax gimmicks."
1961.224,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,529.771,533.691,"And that of course, the government's argument was that it was sham but (Inaudible) --"
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,533.691,534.467,Precisely.
1961.224,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,534.467,535.405,-- they had in that year.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,535.405,535.945,Precisely.
1961.224,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,555.531,557.431,"And the Government said, ""Yes you may --"""
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,557.431,557.778,In that --
1961.224,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,557.778,560.584,-- in relation of the general call price but not to the special call price.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,560.584,561.474,Special call price.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,571.265,575.398,"Well, the Government said to many other taxpayers that they could do it?"
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,575.398,576.301,That is correct.
1961.224,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,588.214,591.941,Has the Third Circuit case been published in the federal circuit yet?
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,591.941,594.636,I have not been able to find the citation Mr. Justice Harlan.
1961.224,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,597.761,599.232,And that serves (Inaudible) --
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,599.232,602.719,-- only one I know.
1961.224,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,814.99,821.541,What percentage of the bonds were subject to the other -- outstanding issue was subject to the special call?
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,821.541,843.713,"The issuer was required either through cash or through property editions to deposit 1% of the face amount of the bonds in the -- in the Appalachian Power and Light, this was 1% of 17 million in the Arkansas Power & Light, it was 1 % of 18 million, each year or in lieu thereof property additions."
1961.224,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,966.822,970.427,"That's a little different from Judge Friendly's rationale, is it?"
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,970.427,983.193,"Judge Friendly's rationale seems to be that on the question of realism, there was no realistic possibility."
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1004.043,1007.081,"But your basic argument is, that does make any difference, isn't it?"
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,1007.081,1014.355,Precisely because whether you talk about the economic possibilities or the legal probabilities as the respondent would talk about.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.355,1015.082,Yes.
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,1015.082,1018.908,And he uses the words contingent and limited.
1961.224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1025.387,1027.734,And you say that that is an issue that's --

1961.224,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1297.909,1303.941,What do you think of Judge Friendly's distinction in the Korell case?
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,1303.941,1312.005,"Mr. Justice Harlan, I must say that it took me a fair amount of time to understand Judge Friendly's distinction."
1961.224,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1345.432,1350.004,"Well, I was hoping you'll give me some light in this either."
1961.224,0,43377,theodore_tannenwald_jr,,1350.004,1350.258,I thought he --

1961.224,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1922.186,1926.268,Was that the consistent interpretation of the Commissioner?
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1926.268,1929.576,It was not the consistent interpretation of the Commissioner.
1961.224,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1964.325,1966.494,Did those snowflakes reach Congress?

1961.224,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2113.311,2114.079,-- you could do.
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2114.079,2120.055,These private rulings or if I might say that -- they are private.
1961.224,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2143.377,2146.078,"They have a way of getting out, don't they?"
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2146.078,2158.993,"Your Honor, I know that they are, at least in this case, there was this ruling published and I'm sure that the capable tax services keep up with the Internal Revenue Service's views."
1961.224,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2236.335,2250.29,Are we entitled to assume that if-- if the taxpayers in this case have asked for such a -- a letter that they would have been permitted to make this deduction?
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2250.29,2259.149,Mr. Chief Justice the -- I think that is in part of function of the number of requests for these rulings.

1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2533.094,2534.635,Precisely.
1961.224,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2536.27,2538.47,I'm not saying what I think the statute is but --
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2538.47,2538.498,No.
1961.224,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2538.498,2539.956,-- that's the answer.
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2550.019,2561.629,The taxpayers are chargeable with knowledge of the opportunity to obtain private rulings which in their private cases will be afforded to binding effect if the facts --

1961.224,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2580.179,2590.096,But the fact that they might have got this controlling private information by the mean that they did get it.
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2590.096,2593.043,I would -- I would like to turn to the statute.
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.132,2600.045,"It does means the other taxpayers in the same year got -- got this in tax advantage, does it not?"
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2600.045,2601.388,Taxpayers --
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.388,2606.239,Other taxpayers in the same calendar taxable year?
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2606.239,2614.034,"I know that taxpayers in the year 1953 had their returns questioned, because these are taxpayers in that year --"
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2614.034,2614.372,"Yes, but --"
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2614.372,2622.123,I know that the taxpayers who in 1952 and in October 1953 got private letters.
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.161,2632.853,"Well, I for one don't want to tell you because the really important part of this case is not this part but it's what the statute of regulations mean, isn't it?"
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2632.853,2634.591,I believe that is so.
1961.224,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2717.989,2723.929,"I wonder what you call three steps were really isn't just fragmentizing one step, I don't understand what the three step is --"
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2723.929,2724.562,"Well, I --"
1961.224,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2724.562,2726.427,What that adds to the argument?
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2726.427,2729.978,I just -- I thought that it might be helpful to approach in that way.
1961.224,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2729.978,2731.188,Use it --
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2731.188,2732.356,I'm just -- I don't mean to confuse you.
1961.224,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2732.356,2733.593,(Inaudible)
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2733.593,2744.004,The case this morning is concerned with the identification of when a bond is subject to an earlier call date.
1961.224,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2936.151,2940.641,We'll recess now Mr. --
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2942.529,2956.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, Section 125 provides for an amortizable bond premium deduction where the bond is subject to an earlier call date."
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.724,3129.069,"Well, absent the special call price, you don't question the absolute legality of all of these, do you?"
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3129.069,3129.819,We -- we do not --
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3129.819,3131.711,And of the year 1953.
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3131.711,3137.08,We do not question the legality of the amortization to the general call date --
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3137.08,3138.998,I say absent the question of a special call price.
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3138.998,3139.809,That's right.
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3139.809,3141.742,So what -- what's the point of all this?
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3141.742,3154.756,"The point of this Mr. Justice Stewart is that petitioners attempt to make these devices for deductions available were bonds are, in our judgment not subject to call."
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3188.863,3190.909,"(Inaudible) -- well, I don't quite understand it."
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3194.304,3194.416,Well --
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3194.416,3195.573,"-- in this case, aren't we?"
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3195.573,3203.819,"Mr. Justice Stewart in our -- in our judgment, the price only becomes pertinent when the call date is identified."
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3219.06,3220.239,In certain other funds?
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3220.239,3224.72,"In certain other funds, to purchase bonds drawn by lot --"
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3224.72,3225.06,Yes.
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3225.06,3227.639,-- on 30 days notice at 102.
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3227.639,3228.674,At a different price.
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3228.674,3228.907,Yes.
1961.224,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3230.749,3232.323,But each on 30 days notice?
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3232.323,3232.751,That's right.
1961.224,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3336.783,3342.764,Are these special call provisions (Inuadible) -- unusual kinds of bonds?
1961.224,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,3342.764,3347.775,"Mr. Justice Harlan, I do not believe that they are unusual in the public utility industry."
