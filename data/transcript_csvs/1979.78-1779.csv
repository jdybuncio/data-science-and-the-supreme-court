1979.78-1779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.036,The case is submitted.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,39.01,39.546,"Thank you, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,165.243,173.35,"The -- was the trial before or after our decision in the Monell case, the trial?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,173.35,178.023,The trial was prior to Monell.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,189.006,189.071,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,189.071,191.918,-- Monell was handed down and this Court --
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,191.918,192.916,Remanded.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,192.916,196.886,"Remanded, vacating the decision in light of Monell --"
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.886,197.737,Right.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,197.737,199.327,-- to the Eighth Circuit.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,236.137,238.059,The -- just so I can get this in mind.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,241.279,241.841,"Pardon me, sir?"
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.841,244.099,The trial was before the Monell case and the --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,244.099,244.326,Correct.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.326,253.195,"-- trial court judgment was before the Monell case, and that judgment exonerated the individuals based on Wood against Strickland."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,253.195,253.698,"No, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,256.288,256.358,Denied relief entirely?
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,256.358,260.718,"The Eighth Circuit reversed the trial court, still prior to Monell."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.718,261.233,Right.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,273.72,274.906,With regard to the city?
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.906,275.228,Yes.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,275.228,276.656,It granted relief --
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.656,278.302,"Right, I see."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,278.302,282.32,-- both declaratory and equitable relief.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,282.32,285.767,"And that also was, of course, before the Monell decision here."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,285.767,286.486,Correct.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.486,292.271,"And then, your brother on the other side, I suppose, petitioned for certiorari."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,292.271,292.804,That is correct.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.804,295.039,If you had won.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,295.039,295.485,Sir?
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.485,296.993,You -- you had prevailed in the Court of Appeals.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,296.993,299.188,"That is correct, yes, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.188,299.652,And it was then --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,299.652,300.043,And the --
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,300.043,300.091,-- that the Court --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,300.091,303.044,"In fact, Monell had not served and decide it."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.044,303.227,Right.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,303.227,306.454,And it was while this Court was considering the petition for certiorari --
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.454,306.565,That Monell was decided.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,306.565,308.008,-- that it handed down Monell.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,308.008,317.497,"And then, this Court remanded the -- vacated the judgment, remanded it to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in the -- to reconsider it in the light of Monell."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,317.497,318.674,Correct.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,318.712,332.194,"And it was then that the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that the city was not liable because that the city, too, had an equivalent immunity to that of the individual defendants."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,332.194,332.862,That is correct.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.862,332.941,Is that it?
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,332.941,333.785,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.785,334.865,Thank you.
1979.78-1779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,334.865,339.555,Why do you think the Eighth Circuit panel completely reversed itself?
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,342.767,356.141,"I can only say with the court en banc of the Tenth Circuit in its rehearing on Bertot, that the Court simply made an inextricable flip-flop."
1979.78-1779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,390.501,390.55,Certainly --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,390.55,399.308,"We find no rationale, no change of facts, no findings different than in the prior decision."
1979.78-1779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,412.128,423.498,"Certainly, they must have seen something in Monell and in the grant, vacate and remand action by this Court that persuaded them to jump the other way."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,423.498,427.408,"Well, I certainly can't speak for the Eighth Circuit, but I can speak for myself."
1979.78-1779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,440.392,441.77,And that's why you're here.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,441.77,444.069,Exactly.
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.907,489.948,"Before you get to the immunity question, counsel, what do you have here by way of liability against the city other than a respondeat superior theory?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,501.143,512.941,"Well, as the Eighth Circuit on remand found, considering the point raised in Monell that it must not be respondeat superior and that it must be official action."
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.863,524.227,Was that (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,524.227,536.624,It was based upon the denial of a hearing upon his termination which was a part of the charter provisions of the city.
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.389,549.706,"Well, a --"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,549.706,550.154,It --
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.154,555.258,-- a municipal corporation can proceed only through individuals.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,574.674,608.268,"Well, if we were speaking of the action of the City Council, in light of a city ordinance, denying such hearing -- well, first of all, I -- I think I have ignored the circumstances of the termination which involved the entire action of the Council, the entire action of the City Manager, great publicity, and we have the, of course, the -- the liberty issue of stigma which gave rise to the procedure of due process right."
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.074,615.606,"Well, do you -- do you think you --"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,615.606,618.358,-- under which he would not be liable for respondeat superior.
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,618.358,632.265,Do you think the doctrine of respondeat superior applies only to low-level employees that it cannot be used to impose liability on the -- the highest official of the municipal corporation?
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,632.265,640.496,"Well, certainly, as an inanimate person, the city cannot act except through its officials."
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.733,651.776,And it's --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,651.776,655.008,"And in this case, we're talking about the highest officials of the city."
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.008,660.235,And it's imputed to the city by reason of respondeat superior.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,660.235,661.888,"Well, I do not see so, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.476,709.755,"Well, that's what I was trying to --"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,709.755,715.295,(Voice Overlap) The Eighth Circuit had no trouble and we have no trouble of saying this was official policy.
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.612,719.777,That was what I was trying to get at.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,725.23,741.673,"We says so in the Eighth Circuit despite holding to the -- against us in its remand said this is now under -- because of Monell, is under 183 and it clearly is official policy of the city."
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.141,769.989,Do you think the official policy referred to in Monell would require an affirmative policy protecting constitutional rights or simply a -- would require a policy which contravened constitutional rights?
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,769.989,771.578,"Well, I suppose it could be either."
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.781,817.588,"Do you think there's a difference between a city ordinance as passed by the City Council that says the City Manager shall do the following and orders him to do it, order -- orders him to take some action, and he does it and the city sued, and the other case is the City Council authorizes him to do it?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,837.285,839.529,"As I understand the question, I think not."
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.417,855.046,"Well, you've got one -- you've got something like that here, haven't you?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,860.462,863.599,"Well, the ordinance denies the right to a hearing --"
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.599,863.892,Right.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,863.892,864.618,-- on termination.
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.618,864.916,Right.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,872.598,874.435,"That is correct, yes, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.435,893.26,"Now, what -- take the third case that the -- let's assume there was no ordinance here at all, one way or another, about a hearing but the -- the executive officers of the city just deny a hearing, and then the --"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,893.26,894.663,We -- we would see no problem with that.
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.663,896.602,And then the city is sued.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,896.602,900.529,We -- we think it would still be a denial of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1983.
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.529,901.537,"Well, how would you know?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,902.961,903.204,Pardon me.
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,903.204,906.801,-- that it's a city policy?
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,923.744,930.759,"Well, I think it projects -- the question projects beyond the facts of this case."
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.754,943.645,"You don't need to go any further than to say that -- that whether the City Manager could do it on his own or not, here, there's an ordinance."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,943.645,951.914,"Well, not only there was an ordinance, there was action by the City Council the night before which, inextricably, was interlinked with his action the following morning."
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.914,955.305,Alright.
1979.78-1779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,955.305,967.744,"I'm not sure I, now, after these -- these several colloquies, distinguish between what you have described as policy and what was implementation or execution of the policy."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,980.822,983.136,"Well, we don't see it as a dichotomy."
1979.78-1779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1000.64,1001.417,So the -- the dividing line --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1001.417,1005.573,-- and that interlinked with the action of the City Manager the next morning.
1979.78-1779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1005.573,1013.161,The dividing line that you've drawn is between the ordinance and the action taken pursuant to it by the Council.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1013.161,1039.696,"Well, we consider them both under the concept of official policy or implementation of official policy which we think this Court viewed in Monell as official action or as not -- not subject to an immunity."
1979.78-1779,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.777,1243.386,"Your opponent, of course, disagrees with you on that."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1246.93,1260.479,"We do not recall that he cited any cases in the 19th century in which there was a -- a -- if a city was sueable, that it had any immunity."
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1260.479,1261.831,"Well, that's a --"
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1261.831,1262.912,(Inaudible)
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1262.912,1263.262,Sir?
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.262,1271.231,"-- that's -- the problem is -- the problem, because there was sovereign immunity for -- for municipalities with respect to part of their functions."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1271.231,1288.522,"Well, where there was -- the -- the question of sovereign immunity, of course, was answered by this Court in Monell and it -- the sovereign immunity doctrine, which was a constantly shifting doctrine, did not apply --"
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.522,1288.744,"So, more than (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1288.744,1293.167,-- where a statute had subjected the city to suit.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1310.206,1334.84,"But as the question of my brother White suggests, in the era in which this federal statute was enacted, the general doctrine was that a city had sovereign immunity for any liability of its governmental activities and it was liable only for its so-called proprietary activities."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1338.153,1345.1,"Well, the -- the problem was not with the words “governmental propriety” but with the definition of those words."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1345.1,1351.758,"I understand that, but wasn't that the -- wasn't that the generally accepted law in that era?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1351.758,1352.131,"Well, to the --"
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.131,1353.768,Regardless of definitional problem (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1353.768,1354.728,"That's correct, yes, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1354.728,1373.088,"-- they exist and existed then, the law was that a -- that a municipality was sovereign immune -- because of its sovereign capacity, was immune for liability for any of its governmental activities but was liable for its so-called proprietary activities only."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1373.088,1373.382,Well --
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1373.382,1375.018,Wasn't -- wasn't that the general --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1375.018,1377.179,"Well, our problem, sir, is that --"
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1377.179,1379.299,"(Voice Overlap) Well, that question can be answered yes or no."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1379.299,1384.142,The answer is -- is yes as to the wording of that concept.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1386.79,1387.004,And then Monell --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1387.004,1387.699,It's --
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.699,1401.784,"-- came along and held that, as a matter of federal law under 1983, a city is no longer immune for its governmental activities."

1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1402.75,1403.045,Under 1983.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1403.045,1403.375,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.375,1404.424,Or any of its activities.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1404.424,1408.197,Or any of its activities under 1983.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1408.197,1409.656,"That is true, yes, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1409.656,1427.802,"But the point is that it -- that it was -- that the historic state of the law at the time of the enactment of 1983 was that a city was immune, completely immune for its governmental activities, whatever they -- those might be, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1427.802,1429.57,"Well, it was immune when it could not be sued."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.156,1430.722,"Well, that's right."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1431.978,1435.106,"Well, not so, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1441.452,1441.685,Well --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1441.685,1445.215,Immunity is -- is not being subject to suit.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1445.215,1447.441,But you -- anybody can sue anybody but --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1447.441,1447.622,Yes.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1447.622,1462.632,"-- a defendant can immediately say “Look, I'm a municipality and what is my wrong -- alleged wrongdoing was a matter of my governmental activities” and that's a complete defense or used to be at least."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1462.632,1464.524,"Well, that is correct."
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.628,1487.34,But the United States of America has sovereign immunity and it's nonetheless sueable.
1979.78-1779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1494.337,1494.875,Right.
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.875,1496.881,It's -- it's sueable.

1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.285,1500.491,"Justice Stewart says, anybody can sue anybody."
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1509.8,1521.373,I think this Court's answer in Monell was that it was sueable.
1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.484,1669.779,What if the City of Independence simply had an individual police officer who felt that Blacks should not be in the city after a certain time.

1979.78-1779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.683,1737.939,"And by official action, you mean an ordinance?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1737.939,1740.215,"Well, it would not necessarily need to be an ordinance."
1979.78-1779,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1764.781,1767.84,May I ask you a question about these facts?
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1780.049,1781.363,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1781.363,1782.615,Is it your position that that --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1782.615,1786.753,"Well, pardon me, sir."
1979.78-1779,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1792.584,1796.11,Who makes that judgment?
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1798.786,1809.762,"In this case, we say that judgment was the combined judgment initiated with the action of the City Council and implemented by the City Manager."

1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1810.255,1820.062,"There might be a case where he acted without the character of this case, totally without consultation with the Council, totally on his own."

1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1834.87,1836.59,That was the District Court's finding.

1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1934.263,1937.004,"Well, I think --"
1979.78-1779,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1937.004,1939.013,Robert -- Roberts was a member of the Council.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1939.013,1942.499,"Well, he was a member of the Council who was a lame duck councilman."

1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1945.236,1945.269,-- this suit.

1979.78-1779,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1949.946,1950.202,It doesn't?

1979.78-1779,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1967.903,1968.289,So your case --
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1968.289,1972.56,"In this case, we -- we are -- our case is obviously bottomed on Roth."

1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,1989.567,1990.731,Roberts' statement.

1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,2057.668,2062.841,-- the compliance with the direction of that resolution by the City Manager.
1979.78-1779,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.841,2074.766,"Your opponent makes great -- poses great weight on a distinction between a policy case and a conduct case throughout his brief, which do you say this was?"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,2074.766,2075.849,Both.
1979.78-1779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2084.177,2084.576,"Well, you return the distinction --"
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,2084.576,2099.756,"-- the Monell speaks of -- of policy or the implementation of policy by the highest authorities of the city, and we view this as involving elements of both."
1979.78-1779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2109.079,2111.292,Maybe he'll clarify that for us.
1979.78-1779,0,28475,irving_achtenberg,,2111.35,2112.091,Sir?
1979.78-1779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2112.091,2113.364,Maybe he'll clarify that for us now.

1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.063,2297.435,You never have any problem unless it's implemented.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2297.435,2298.644,Right.
1979.78-1779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2447.182,2450.025,Was -- Mr. Owen was the Chief of Police.

1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2476.234,2478.339,-- the unfettered discretion.
1979.78-1779,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2478.339,2486.501,But he could only be dismissed for cause in the sense that it was defined that it's for the good of the services.

1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.147,2684.514,-- but thought there was immunity.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2684.514,2685.917,The -- the way that the Court of Appeals --

1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2689.125,2691.604,I'm actually arguing both.
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2691.604,2693.769,"Well, right now, you're arguing no policy."

1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2726.024,2735.071,"-- think you still have to decide whether or not, on that basis, what type of cause of action we're dealing with here."
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2739.61,2744.558,You're saying even if it was policy that it would still be immunity.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2744.558,2745.256,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.311,2790.735,"Well, what if the -- what if the City Council had specifically ordered that no hearing be granted --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2790.735,2791.158,The City Council --
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2791.158,2794.162,"And then they -- and then they, in implementation of that --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2794.162,2794.591,Yes.
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.591,2795.223,-- it isn't granted.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2795.223,2802.482,"The -- the City Council, school boards, any type of public governmental body can act in a -- in a legislative capacity."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2837.141,2841.858,The city wouldn't -- the city wouldn't be liable.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2841.858,2844.187,That's another difficult point.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.667,2846.62,Isn't that what you're talking about?
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2846.62,2847.705,"Yes, but as a --"
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2847.705,2848.094,"Well, isn't that --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2848.094,2863.162,"-- practical matter, the reasons behind the good faith defense, as cited in -- the two reasons are cited in Scheuer versus Rhodes, have always recognized the fact that cities indemnify their employees."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.893,2901.625,"When would the -- when would the -- if there's any rule that a city shouldn't be liable on a respondeat superior basis, when would that ever apply if it -- if it didn't apply when an employee, contrary to policy, acting on his own in bad faith, hurt somebody?"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2901.625,2912.611,"I think the respondeat superior rule should apply in full force when an employee acting in bad faith and as in this case with Paul Roberts, in violation of official policy."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.681,2927.832,"Well, then, you want to -- that isn't the ground the Court of Appeals used."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2927.832,2935.213,"No, the Court of Appeals quite simply, and without much analysis, held that that conduct could fairly be said to be official policy."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.213,2935.709,Yes.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2939.129,2942.805,"Yes, as -- as far as the Paul Roberts statement was concerned."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.805,2947.283,"So, for you to win, do we have to overturn the Court of Appeals?"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2947.283,2947.583,No.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.583,2948.792,"Well, we have to disagree with them."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,2948.792,2973.917,"No, I'm saying that it's either one case or the other, Your Honor, that treat it as conduct or treat it as policy, don't find some critical gap in between the two where I have no policy which has given deference, which I think this Court would give under the separation of parish doctrine, and I have no conduct which is given a good faith defense."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.434,3001.184,Well --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3001.184,3002.228,What do I have?
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.228,3023.169,"-- let's -- let's suppose that there was a city ordinance or a provision in the Charter that says that whenever any department heads are discharged, no hearing shall be -- the -- the City Manager has complete discretion and he -- and when he discharges them, no hearing shall be ever given."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3027.45,3029.367,I would definitely say that's policy.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.891,3036.937,"And let's just say the City Manager discharges somebody, a hearing is demanded, and he denies it saying “I can't grant one."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3037.287,3037.974,My --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.974,3038.673,"Now, you wouldn't --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3038.673,3038.979,Then --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.979,3039.277,-- say the city -- you wouldn't say the --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3039.277,3040.864,"--the -- the Charter -- excuse me, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.864,3044.196,"You wouldn't say that the city is -- has a qualified immunity there, would you?"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3044.196,3045.362,I would not.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.474,3047.678,"So, the whole question is whether the --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3047.678,3049.399,And I would ask you to give deference to my Charter.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.399,3056.042,"-- the whole question in the case then is whether there's policy or not, not whether there's immunity."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3056.042,3060.922,I -- I agree that there is no qualified immunity to true policy.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.224,3077.444,So you do want us to -- you do want us then to say the Court of Appeals was just clearly wrong on saying there was policy.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3077.444,3091.636,"No, because I think what the Court of Appeals did in this case, they said, under the particular circumstances of this case, that qualified immunity could be granted."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.177,3109.61,I thought you --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3109.61,3109.981,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.981,3117.94,"(Voice Overlap) argue that if there was no policy, there wasn't any -- any liability at all, qualified or not."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3124.797,3147.019,"I was tempted to make that argument, Your Honor, and basically because of the indemnity provisions in some state laws and the informal indemnity that is given as a matter of course at any rate, it would be simplistic for me to argue that the city will never be liable for the conduct of its employees."
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3148.476,3165.267,"Counsel, supposing that you have an ordinance that is exactly the converse of what my Brother White is suggesting that says, in every case of the firing of a department head, there shall be the opportunity for a hearing conducted by the City Manager."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3186.569,3188.13,I agree completely.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.13,3188.667,Never.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3188.667,3190.207,I agree.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3219.935,3225.072,"Oh, I still don't know what you do with the Court of Appeals conclusion there was -- that there was policy here."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3225.072,3228.633,I accept it because it's not a question presented in this case.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.362,3229.421,No --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3229.421,3230.892,Once the Court of Appeals --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3230.892,3233.871,"You -- I suppose if you are a respondent, you could probably say --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3233.871,3234.526,Yes.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.526,3235.744,-- there wasn't policy --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3235.744,3236.356,Well --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.356,3238.272,-- and -- and that you didn't cross-petition --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3238.272,3243.953,"In my last point relied on, I, in essence, raise certainly elements of that argument."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.502,3252.692,"But if there's policy and there's just implementation of a city policy involved here, I don't know how you --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3252.692,3269.014,"But I don't see -- what we have here, really, I think, is respondeat superior, as -- as was recognized in the discussion before, and I'm willing to accept that as favorable to my case, but I'm saying it's not dispositive of my case."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.94,3287.974,Let's assume -- let's assume --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3287.974,3289.572,We get one or the other.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.572,3301.352,"Now -- now, if you -- if you agree that the pure implementation of a policy, of an admitted policy, would -- would not -- that there would be no immunity there."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3311.444,3316.79,I do not believe that there was a -- a policy I -- I know for --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.79,3317.156,I -- I know you don't --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3317.156,3317.853,-- a fact.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.853,3320.18,-- but let's suppose you did.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3320.18,3329.886,"If, in the example, I believe, that you gave, Your Honor, that there was a charter provision saying no hearings whatsoever, we would be here."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.942,3339.986,"Well, what if --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3339.986,3340.661,We would be talking --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.661,3340.814,-- what --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3340.814,3341.464,-- about whether there was --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.464,3341.52,-- what if the Charter --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3341.52,3343.123,-- any rational basis.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.123,3355.647,-- what if the Charter said the City -- the City Manager has -- has broad executive powers and he has powers to issue regulations to carry out provisions of this Charter --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3355.647,3355.803,I believe --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.803,3357.322,-- and he issues a set of regulations --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3357.322,3357.676,Yes.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.676,3363.819,"-- that says “in -- in furtherance of my power of discharge, here is the procedure”."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3365.667,3366.13,I do believe --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3366.13,3367.566,There is no procedure and he --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3367.566,3368.932,Yes.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.932,3371.764,-- fires a man and no -- no hearing.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3372.818,3387.661,"I do believe that it is possible for a city manager to create city policy, although I must agree that in a council-manager form of government, historically, the City Council creates policy and the City Manager executes it."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3398.233,3398.719,And the City --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3398.719,3401.447,"-- that we could, in essence, have an administrative rule that we would be talking --"
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3401.447,3401.89,And that --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3401.89,3402.235,-- about.
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.27,3404.853,"In which event, there would be no qualified immunity."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3404.853,3407.858,"It's exactly right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.933,3460.917,"Mr. Carlisle, can I ask you a question about the -- the basic claim in the case to -- to get all these arguments in better focus."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3469.565,3470.839,"In large, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3470.839,3486.91,"Now, assume that the same events took place today and everybody knew the law, so you wouldn't have this kind of a good faith argument, would you agree that the facts would support recovery by the plaintiff under 1983 against somebody?"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3486.91,3487.691,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.691,3489.843,"Okay, I just want to be sure of that."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3489.843,3506.703,"Actual good faith in this case, of course, was not limited solely to the nonexistence of settled law and, indeed, the existence of good faith is not a question presented on appeal but in that regard, we also were talking about no malice which was established below."
1979.78-1779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3511.729,3516.452,"That would have to do with the extent of damages, perhaps, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3516.452,3521.743,I believe it has much to do with -- with the qualified good faith immunity which would -- would defeat --
1979.78-1779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.743,3524.548,"Well, I'm talking about the job offers that were made that might --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3524.548,3527.386,"Yes, that would be mitigation as well, but it's -- it's --"
1979.78-1779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3527.386,3527.673,And the amount (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3527.673,3533.121,-- the type of subjective factor that I think the Court took into consideration when talking about no malice.
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3533.121,3550.197,"Well, you -- you have in this case, don't you, as in so many cases of this kind, different elements that are very easily kind of interchangeable and not easy to separate?"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3584.233,3585.949,Yes.
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3656.591,3656.87,"Well, what --"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3656.87,3657.929,-- such a thing as policy exempt.
1979.78-1779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3657.929,3662.689,-- what has fraud got to do with the constitutional violation with 1983?
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3662.689,3675.32,I think you could have fraudulent conspiracy to deprive someone of a constitutional right and that conspiracy could be either in the making of policy or in the execution of policy.
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3730.639,3734.412,"Mr. Carlisle, let me carry the question I asked you before one step further."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3744.656,3755.575,"If we do accept, as I have only for the purposes of argument, that in some event, conduct can bind the city, and I think basically it can."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3783.191,3794.493,"And -- and specifically, this is such a case, unless we hold, that there is good faith immunity for the municipality."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3794.493,3797.56,"I'm -- I'm afraid I don't understand the question, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3797.56,3818.184,"I -- I think I understand you to be arguing and in part admitting that if the facts we have before us occurred today, so there was no good faith immunity defense available, the city would be liable which -- the converse of which is that you are saying, in essence, that you are relying squarely on good faith immunity as the reason the city is not liable."

1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3832.744,3837.071,"If that's true, may I ask you, because I really didn't find you addressing this very much."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3848.84,3852.177,Simply because you look at the nature of the cause of action.
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3894.466,3895.355,How does the --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3895.355,3895.484,-- the entity --
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3895.484,3900.508,It's rather unusual to have an affirmative defense relate back to the prima facie case.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3900.508,3901.949,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3938.791,3939.549,"In fact, pecuniae then as to --"

1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3940.241,3941.724,-- support your position on that.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3944.12,3945.199,Yes.
1979.78-1779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3945.199,3951.98,"Mr. Carlisle, the only injury alleged in this case, as I understand it, is stigma."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3952.793,3955.354,"As I understand it, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3955.354,3959.785,"The District Court found, also as I understand it, that there was no stigma."

1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3964.082,3966.477,"Again, it's not the question presented on appeal."
1979.78-1779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3977.124,3979.957,"Well, why don't you stand on that?"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3979.957,3982.392,"Well, it was back [Laughs] a little bit further on my argument."
1979.78-1779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3982.392,3983.167,Which -- in -- in responding --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3983.167,3984.842,"It is in my last point relied on, Your Honor."

1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,3990.702,3993.894,I do not concede that stigma is present in this case.
1979.78-1779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3993.894,3995.445,Alright.
1979.78-1779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3995.445,4000.262,Certiorari (Inaudible).
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4000.262,4003.711,The Court of Appeals found there was.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4003.711,4007.163,"The Court of Appeals found that there was a deprivation of liberty, that's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4007.163,4009.219,And that there was stigma and --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4009.219,4009.708,There must be --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4009.708,4014.216,"So -- so -- and to the extent that it's a respondent, you rely on the contrary."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4017.913,4018.172,In my last point --
1979.78-1779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4018.172,4019.744,-- which is your privilege -- which is your privilege.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4019.744,4023.845,"Yes, and my last point relied on, Your Honor, I claim that there was no deprivation of liberty."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4023.845,4028.28,"Well, in fairness to you then, Mr. Carlisle, you really want to withdraw your answer to one of my questions."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4028.28,4028.332,I don't think so.
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4028.332,4035.45,"You don't really accept, for purposes of decision, the proposition that if this conduct occurred today, it would be liability against anybody."

1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4073.236,4074.856,"There would be none, under my last point relied on."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4074.856,4075.894,Because of the argument that there's not a --
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4075.894,4080.487,I do not believe that plaintiff has established threshold question of deprivation of liberty.
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4080.487,4083.901,"And that's because you don't regard these -- these comments as stigma, is that it?"
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4083.901,4087.632,"They -- they were not stigmatizing in connection with the discharge, Your Honor, which you must --"
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4087.632,4092.39,Is that because (a) we're not stigmatizing or (b) we're not in connection with the discharge?

1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4111.417,4113.589,I want to know which are you relying on here.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4113.589,4120.788,"I have conceded, for the purposes of argument, all along that the robust comments of Paul Roberts were stigmatizing."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4120.788,4123.514,"Alright, and do you -- but you deny that they are in connection with the discharge."
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4123.514,4124.959,"I certainly do, Your Honor."
1979.78-1779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4124.959,4127.04,You also argue that they were cured in any event.
1979.78-1779,1,38984,richard_g_carlisle,,4127.04,4129.207,"I do, Your Honor."
