1982.82-271,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.388,We will hear arguments next in Chardon against Soto.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,87.509,111.156,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, nine years ago this Court, in American Pipe and Construction Company versus Utah, held that the statute of limitations is temporarily suspended in federal class actions until the District Court determines whether to certify the class."
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.574,389.635,And what was the ground?
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,394.728,397.258,"The court below, Justice White?"
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.317,427.464,"--Well, partly wouldn't you also say, Mr. DeGooyer, that the last paragraph of the Court opinion in American Pipe and Construction, which at least your opponents read to suggest made that the suspension aspect of the ruling depend on the Clayton Act rather than on a rule peculiar to federal class action?"
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,427.464,428.372,Right.
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,431.34,435.992,You disagree with my statement or with your opponent's... what I think is your opponent's view?
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,435.992,438.149,--I agree with your statement that the opinion so reads.
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.108,614.797,May I ask a question--
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,614.797,615.608,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.608,617.796,--about something you said about the Puerto Rico law?
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,621.06,621.715,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,621.715,640.878,"--by applying... by saying that Puerto Rico would in effect apply a counterpart to the American Pipe case, but is it not true that with respect to the second question, namely, for how long the tolling period is, that they relied on Puerto Rico law for saying the statute starts to run all over again."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,640.878,643.767,"Puerto Rico law in a different context, Justice Stevens, if I may."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.811,698.153,"So your position really, if I understand you correctly, is not that they tolled it for the wrong period, but there should have been no tolling at all."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,698.153,699.901,That's correct.
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.432,745.665,What if this hadn't been a class action?
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,761.299,764.375,Let me see if I understand the hypothetical.
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.375,766.562,It is not a class action.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,769.312,770.138,It was indeed.
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.138,775.028,And the defendant moves to dismiss on the grounds that the statute of limitations has already run.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,775.028,777.263,"Well, it either would have run or it wouldn't have run."
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.306,782.836,"Well, but it would have been... my question is, what law would... what statute of limitations would apply?"
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,782.836,787.07,"--We would use the one-year Puerto Rico statute of limitations, which we are in fact using right now."
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.07,792.003,"And if there was some claim of tolling in the case, it would be Puerto Rico law, too?"
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,792.003,793.052,"Yes, indeed."
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.052,795.302,And for how long it would have tolled?
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,795.302,796.051,One year.
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.051,796.628,Yes.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,796.628,799.923,And that is because Section 5303 specifically covers the situation.
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.923,800.344,I understand.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,807.715,816.617,"I certainly do say that, and I also say it is very easy to say in this case, because there is no Puerto Rico law that covers this situation as the First Circuit so said."
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.617,820.505,But those are really two quite distinct positions.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,820.505,821.241,They are indeed two questions.
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,821.241,828.174,I take it your underlying position is that American Pipe is based on the Rule 23 class actions--
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,828.174,828.83,Absolutely.
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,828.83,833.424,--and provides a federal rule of tolling no matter what the substantive origin of the claim.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,833.424,834.594,That is entirely correct.
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.851,1019.193,"Well, the First Circuit did hold otherwise, didn't it?"
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1019.193,1023.221,"I don't... well, let me say, what the First Circuit did was this, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.822,1044.789,From state law?
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1044.789,1051.695,"They fashioned a rule which they believed to be state law, which has no foundation in the law itself, and which--"
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.695,1053.988,But that is true... federal courts lots of times have to do that--
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1053.988,1054.335,--I certainly--
1982.82-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1054.335,1060.145,"--in diversity cases, or in a case like this, where they have to say, true, there isn't a decided Puerto Rico case on the subject."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1062.672,1067.998,"--There are indeed decided cases that would indicate to the contrary, which we have cited to the Court in our reply brief."
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.994,1138.065,"Well, I understand your position to be that even if the Puerto Rico law was just as clear as a bell, that you would... that American Pipe, to the contrary, American Pipe would still govern."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1138.065,1138.58,Yes.
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.58,1145.984,"Even if there was a Puerto Rico rule that said, after tolling, the period starts running all over again, even if it was perfectly clear."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1145.984,1146.608,"Well, that's--"
1982.82-271,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.608,1150.792,That American Pipe would still determine otherwise in this case.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1150.792,1151.432,--Absolutely.
1982.82-271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1152.138,1161.478,"And also you did not raise your challenge to the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Purto Rican law in the questions presented, did you?"
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1161.478,1177.423,"--I think what we... what we raised in the questions presented was whether the rule of American Pipe and Construction Company, which is a federal rule, applies, and indeed... anything in this Court's decision in Board of Regents versus Tomanio would preclude application."
1982.82-271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1177.423,1184.294,"Sure, but you did not raise a dispute with the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Puerto Rican law."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1184.294,1185.905,That is certainly correct.
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.057,1191.558,I have another difficulty--
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1191.558,1192.369,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.369,1193.683,"--with your argument, if I understand it correctly."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1202.976,1203.819,That's correct.
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.819,1218.08,"And that they... I don't see... Page 16-A of the opinion says that the Puerto Rican law provides there is tolling when an identical cause of action is filed, and then they say the class action is an identical cause of action, and therefore under Puerto Rico law there is tolling."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1223.172,1229.309,I have the opinion.
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.493,1241.429,It says the substantive claims asserted in the class action were identical to those in the subsequent individual actions.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1241.429,1250.145,"Well, in the first point... in the first place, that... the Puerto Rico rule of identical actions does not cover the circumstance."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.002,1263.045,"Well, but there is a Puerto Rican law... a rule that if it is an identical action, there is a toll."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1263.045,1266.122,"By the same individual that refiles, yes."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.122,1270.308,And then the question is whether a class action comes within that rule.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1272.367,1288.457,"Well, indeed, as we have cited in the Caguas Lumberyard case, there is authority to the contrary that the filing of a purported class action by a representative of the class does not involve any of the other people as so-called parties to the action."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.002,1302.188,--But you were telling me that the Court of Appeals had said that Puerto Rican law was silent on it.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1302.188,1303.295,"--Well, let me find the--"
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.295,1303.732,Or in fact--
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1303.732,1304.73,--If I could only find the rule--
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.73,1305.53,--Which I didn't find in the opinion.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1305.53,1306.482,--All right.
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.994,1321.505,"Well, I am relying on your cert position."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1326.427,1336.905,"--Well, in any case, it is absolutely true that they said that Puerto Rico has no discernible state rule."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.405,1340.984,"Well, they have the identity rule."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1340.984,1342.529,"Well, they have--"
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.529,1344.217,"And you agree with that, don't you?"
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1344.217,1363.753,"--I agree that Puerto Rico has by judicial decision held that when an individual brings a lawsuit and it is dismissed for procedural reasons and he refiles a lawsuit that is identical to the first lawsuit, then he satisfies the identical requirement."
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.753,1366.97,All right.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1366.97,1370.815,That is what the cases say.
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.667,1502.1,"But I notice that in that part of the opinion, that's the paragraph after they had decided that the class action was identical, and where they were rejecting the estoppel argument."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1502.1,1508.176,"--Well, I--"
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.176,1515.705,"In any event, you really are asking us to make a fairly close examination of Puerto Rican law, it seems to me."
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1515.705,1516.376,"--No, I think--"
1982.82-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.376,1518.127,To second-guess the First Circuit on it.
1982.82-271,0,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,1518.127,1531.307,"--No, I think that regardless of what Puerto Rico law provides, that Rule 23 governs the tolling here as a single rule of suspension and not a two-part rule."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1643.559,1654.336,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, as counsel for petitioners observed, we are here dealing with 36 cases."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.175,1785.641,The reason Puerto Rico's statute of limitations is relevant to this case at all is because of the absence of the federal statute of limitations.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1785.641,1786.218,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.47,1788.406,"Well, isn't that right?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1788.406,1789.408,"--Yes, that's one."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.408,1790.453,One?
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1792.375,1794.341,"Maybe I didn't understand your question, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.341,1798.857,Suppose that 1983 itself contained a statute of limitations.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1798.857,1803.15,"If Section 1983 itself contained a statute of limitations, then we wouldn't be here today."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.15,1819.036,"Well, and I take it the submission on the other side is that although there isn't a federal statute of limitations, there is a federal rule about tolling in class actions, and therefore, to that extent, Puerto Rican law is irrelevant."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1819.036,1819.894,Your Honor--
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.894,1821.282,That is the submission.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1821.282,1823.189,"--Yes, I understand that, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.189,1825.315,And what is your answer to that?
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1825.315,1830.688,They are basing their primary reliance on this Court's decision in the American Pipe case.
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.231,1849.929,"Well, the American Pipe did hold that in a class action the filing of the action tolls and for just as long... up until the time the class action is denied, and time then begins to run again."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1849.929,1851.192,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.607,1878.153,"Well, what if Puerto Rican law said that filing of the class action does not toll anything for the unnamed members of the class?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1878.153,1882.93,"--If that were the case, Your Honor, then we would... there would be no tolling."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.93,1889.883,"So you say that the first part of American Pipe doesn't apply here either, as a federal rule."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1889.883,1894.27,"Your Honor, that depends upon which one of our first two arguments one looks at."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.605,1927.74,"Well, that was just with respect to when the government suit was filed, and then the Court went on in the last paragraph and said a similar concept."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1931.865,1934.049,But it was based upon this Court's--
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.049,1935.098,"Well, it said a similar concept."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1939.204,1955.823,"--Your Honor, when the Court in American Pipe was trying to balance the Rule 23 interests on the one hand against the appropriate interest in the statutes of limitation on the other, this Court appropriately, in our opinion, looked to the Congressional purpose underlying the particular substantive cause of action."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.645,1969.472,But they just chose one of them.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1969.472,1974.222,And that is because the Clayton Act itself provided for suspension.
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.032,1980.78,"Well, that is just according to how you read it."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,1998.243,1999.572,"Well, Your Honor, suppose--"
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.572,2001.915,We will just... We will apply a similar rule to this.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2001.915,2011.738,"--But, Your Honor, our position is, suppose in American Pipe the Clayton Act limitations and tolling schemes had provided for renewal of the period of limitations."
1982.82-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2019.108,2026.217,"That is based almost entirely, isn't it, on V of the opinion in that last paragraph?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2036.165,2038.898,"--Your Honor, that is because... I understand what you are saying."
1982.82-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.015,2104.902,"But the Clayton Act itself didn't in haec verba provide for this kind of tolling, did it?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2104.902,2111.651,"The Clayton Act on its terms, on its own face, provided only for suspension."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.119,2119.053,"Well, it didn't mention class actions."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2124.021,2125.144,But this Court--
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.144,2126.033,The Clayton Act didn't.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2126.033,2141.214,"--I think that's right, but I think this Court had to choose an appropriate rule which would accommodate the interests that reflected Congressional enactment of the statute of limitations for the Clayton Act to begin with."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.214,2156.726,"What would you suppose... What would you say if Rule 23 itself said that when a class action is filed, it shall suspend the filing of... the running of a statute of limitations, but only for so long, but only up until the time the action is--"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2156.726,2167.282,"Well, Your Honor, in that case, we would have to skip both our first and second arguments and get to a very difficult and broad issue involving the validity of that as a practical--"
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.282,2167.859,--The constitutionality.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2167.859,2168.923,"--Not constitutionality, no."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.111,2172.343,Validity?
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2172.343,2182.105,--validity as applied to these Puerto Rico plaintiffs of the Rule 23... the Rules Enabling Act issue.
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.604,2186.993,"Well, but the Rule 23 is a Congressional enactment."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2186.993,2188.553,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2188.553,2198.911,"But it also provides in relevant part that the rules must be procedural for one thing, and secondly, they must not abridge substantive rights under state law."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2198.911,2200.567,That is our third argument.
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.368,2228.523,May I ask you a question?
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2228.523,2229.162,Of course.
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.162,2237.421,"Under your view of the Court of Appeals opinion, what is the source of law that determined the fact that there should be tolling?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2238.595,2250.371,"The Court of Appeals seemed to rely solely on state law, both with respect to general tolling effect and precise tolling effect."
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.371,2265.677,"What do you think the consequence would have been if the federal Rule 23 read the way Justice White says, that there always should be tolling for just this period, and there were a Puerto Rican statute that said there shall not be tolling in any class action... class action shall not toll?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2267.569,2268.598,"I understand, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.893,2288.435,"Well, I am asking, would there be... would there be tolling if you had a conflict between the language of Rule 23, that talked about class actions generally, and you had these individual actions in which the plaintiffs would claim there was tolling on the basis of Rule 23 but the defendants would say, no, but we have a Puerto Rican statute that says we never toll."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2288.435,2294.619,"--In that situation, assuming Rule 23 as applied would be valid under the Rules Enabling Act, that would be the end of it."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.235,2317.155,"Well, don't you think... you don't... suppose we read American Pipe as saying precisely that."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2317.155,2317.857,Your Honor--
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.857,2321.327,As interpreting Rule 23 as containing such a provision.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2321.327,2325.09,"--Your Honor, that gets... Your Honor, we submit that American Pipe does not do that."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.961,2334.148,"Well, it is a construction--"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2334.148,2334.6,--Pardon?
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.6,2336.07,"--It is a construction of some federal law, isn't it?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2336.07,2340.068,"It is not an interpretation of Rule 23 as such, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.068,2340.941,"Oh, it isn't?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2340.941,2345.675,It is a judicially created common law procedural rule.
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.675,2348.082,But it is certainly based on Rule 23.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2348.082,2359.079,"It is based upon or related to the interests protected by Rule 23, but Your Honor, Rule 23 on its face says nothing at all about tolling."
1982.82-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.654,2374.586,"Well, Rule 26 or whatever rule it is that allows an imposition of sanctions for violation of discovery may not say anything about dismissal, but certainly the courts were free to find that dismissal was an appropriate sanction."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2379.866,2395.983,"--Your Honor, there is a difference in our opinion between a judicial decision interpreting a rule and a judicial decision which sets out its own rule simply by looking at interests set out in, say, Rule 23."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.4,2418.896,"Well, however you put it, it is nonetheless a federal law rule about the impact of a class action on the statute of limitations."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2418.896,2421.334,But it is a judicially created--
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.334,2423.611,"It may be, but it still is a federal rule."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2423.611,2430.096,"--But Your Honor, that brings us to Section 1988, because Section 1988 sets out--"
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.096,2442.138,"And suppose American Pipe had just said that we... in so many words that this is the impact of a filing of a class action on the statute of limitations in all kinds of actions, no matter what."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2443.448,2466.392,"--And we would submit that because of the mandate of Section 1988, that is improper to do, in the same way that this Court rejected the propriety of a judicially created rule of tolling in the Board of Regents versus Tomanio case, in the same way this Court rejected the propriety of a judicially created rule of survivorship in Robertson v. Wegman."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.45,2491.038,"But 1988 just says, the federal law is in a sense non-existent."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2503.531,2504.955,"Well, Your Honor, the concession--"
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.955,2508.266,Because then the federal law wouldn't be deficient for purposes of 1988.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2508.266,2515.78,"--If the earlier concession was limited, we would still argue, even if Rule 23 governed this, that one would have to still look at the underlying cause of action."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.78,2516.919,"Well, I understand that."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2516.919,2517.792,For its limitation scheme.
1982.82-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.792,2523.338,"But you are talking about really fashioning a tolling rule in two different ways under federal, aren't you?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2538.33,2539.313,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.774,2573.646,"So it can't supply the void, the federal void for purposes of 1988?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2573.646,2574.678,"--Not at all, no."
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.648,2614.13,"In your view, would the limitations issue be any different if this litigation, which is an individual litigation following the class action, had been filed in the state court rather than the federal court?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2614.13,2614.785,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.729,2648.02,"Well, not if Justice White's hypothesis is right, that as a matter of federal law which applies and which dictates the consequence of any class action--"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2648.02,2649.615,But that is only... that is only procedural.
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.615,2652.646,"--in any federal claim later asserted, what difference would it make if the federal claim--"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2652.646,2656.502,"Well, Your Honor, that would only be, under Justice White's approach, a Rule 23 interpretation."
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.502,2657.706,"--Well, that's right."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2657.706,2662.093,"Certainly, a Rule 23 interpretation does not bind a Puerto Rico court or any state courts."
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2662.093,2666.405,"Well, the Puerto Rico court is entertaining the federal claim, federal cause of action under 1983."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2666.405,2667.763,A Rule... we--
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.763,2669.686,"I mean, it seems to me that is the logic of the contrary view."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2669.686,2671.027,"--We respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.195,2682.757,"Well, the substantive matter in a 1983 case."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2685.366,2692.143,But it is not a question of substantive law in the same way as the question of when a federal cause of action accrues this.
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.143,2697.392,"Well, it seems to me that is... that argument is just as strong if the case is in the federal court as it is in the state court."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2697.392,2698.846,"How so, Your Honor?"
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.846,2699.626,Well--
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2699.626,2700.811,If I may ask.
1982.82-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.811,2701.954,--You don't have the right to question.
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2701.954,2702.687,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1982.82-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.374,2711.668,"Well, if it is a rhetorical question."
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2727.13,2761.149,"Your Honor, our third argument is relevant if this Court, first of all, rejects our narrow reading of American Pipe, and secondly, it rejects our Section 1988 argument with respect to a void in federal statutory law, which we submit exists, because the American Pipe rule is a judicially created rule of tolling and does not apply, and is not federal statutory law."
1982.82-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2838.676,2841.051,"--But that is Erie analysis, isn't it?"
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2844.892,2847.017,"Yes, but we are using... that's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-271,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2857.339,2866.289,What is the rule in diversity under Erie where you want the case to come out the same way in state courts... in federal courts as it would in state courts?
1982.82-271,1,41818,sheldon_nahmod,,2870.645,2881.704,"It may have no application to a non-diversity case, Your Honor, but as we have argued, this is a Section 1983 case, and Congress has left certain matters silent in Section 1983 cases."
1982.82-271,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.568,2983.648,Very well.
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3006.058,3009.794,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you."
1982.82-271,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3076.671,3079.888,"Counsel, could I ask you a question on American Pipe?"
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3079.888,3080.858,"Yes, Justice Blackmun."
1982.82-271,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3080.858,3089.211,"As I understand it, your position is that American Pipe selected a suspension rule and rejected a renewal rule, correct?"
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3089.211,3102.333,"I would certainly say it selected a suspension rule, that's correct, for the reasons I have stated, and if that necessarily implies rejecting a renewal rule, that is correct, but I don't know that we need reach that."
1982.82-271,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3102.333,3112.436,"Well, my question isn't really whether that is isn't dictum in American Pipe, because under either rule those plaintiffs have been taken care of."
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3112.436,3117.139,"I am not certain I understand your question, Justice Blackmun."
1982.82-271,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3117.139,3133.365,"Well, the plaintiffs' claims there were found to be timely under the suspension rule, but wouldn't they have been timely under a renewal rule as well, and therefore isn't the statement on which you rely in American Pipe dictum?"
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3133.365,3136.38,The suspension statement.
1982.82-271,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3138.817,3139.975,Yes.
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3139.975,3141.894,I am still not sure I understand that question.
1982.82-271,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3146.642,3148.873,Let me start over again.
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3169.24,3171.288,I think not.
1982.82-271,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3196.56,3200.822,"In that case, the plaintiff's claims would have been timely under either rule."
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3200.822,3203.057,--The plaintiffs in this case?
1982.82-271,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3203.057,3204.648,"No, in American Pipe."
1982.82-271,2,30419,john_g_de_gooyer,,3206.384,3213.82,"I don't quite follow whether it's dictum, but I find that they accepted and adopted a rule that found them timely."
1982.82-271,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3215.848,3218.847,"Thank you, gentlemen."
