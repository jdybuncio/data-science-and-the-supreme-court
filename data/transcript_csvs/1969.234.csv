1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.7,"Number 234, Czosek against O'mara."
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,13.328,44.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, honorable justices, this is a case which comes before this Court to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals below which partially reversed and partially affirmed a District Court judgment granting motions to dismiss a complaint."
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,643.739,652.474,"Does the employee Mr. Lyman have any avenue through the adjustment board as you see it, and if so what is that?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,652.474,653.906,Employee --
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,653.906,660.171,"In a proceeding against the union only wherein a claim, asserting a claim keeps the --"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,660.171,661.036,No.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.891,717.159,Did he prevent it?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,717.159,718.025,Pardon me?
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.025,721.011,Did he prevail against all sort of action against the union as such?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,721.011,725.907,No because the adjustment board will make him entirely hold for the alleged wrongful discharge.
1969.234,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,725.907,728.964,"Whom does he proceed against before the board, the employee?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,728.964,729.668,Pardon me?
1969.234,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,729.668,733.307,Whom does the employee proceed against before the board?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,733.307,734.782,The Erie Lackawanna Railroad Company.
1969.234,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,734.782,741.487,"Right, and suppose if he prevails, I gather your position as he has no cause of action against the union?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,741.487,746.902,Because he has recovered fully for any damage or injury he suffered.
1969.234,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,746.902,750.908,"As he does not prevail, then does he have a cause of action against the union?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,750.908,778.839,"That we would contend not because in the Landmark case, recent decision of this Court in Vaca against Sipes, one of the basic element which an employee must sustain and action against his union for unfair representation is that his claim against the company is a good one on the merits."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.386,831.937,"Isn't the -- the law doesn't require, does it?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,841.808,844.049,The law --
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.049,847.587,I know they certainly can give it but if --
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,847.587,851.366,"They normally do, that would depend on whether the contract entitled the man to it or not."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.366,859.113,"And if the board said, if the board said, well that the only place you can get a remedy for reinstatement is from the employer."
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,880.942,885.206,I have seen no such awards and of course you have no assurance.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.206,893.341,Would you think it would be proper under the law for the board to deny full back pay?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,893.341,906.983,"Well, under Your Honors decision in Vaca against Sipes, if part of his damages were attributable to the unions action, the union of course should asses -- be assessed with that liability."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.983,907.974,But the board can do --
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,907.974,909.302,Prorating process.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.302,911.281,But the board couldn't do that?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,911.281,921.816,I don't see how the board could make the decision for some Court before which the employer would go against the union and --
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,921.816,925.112,But it could say that you won't give him back pay?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,925.112,929.828,"As against the union, the union wouldn't even be a party to the claim you see."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.828,934.082,"Or as against the employer they could say, we will not give him back pay."
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,937.456,971.616,"Of course in Your Honor's decision in Vaca against Sipes, you pointed out that there is a little different situation presented when the -- when as in this case, the charge of unfair representation is based on failure to process a grievance which is caused by a completely unrelated independent breach of contract by the employer."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.413,1006.191,"But that's a pleading problem, that's -- it may be that the union, that the employee against the union can't prove its case, unless it proves something like that but it does say that it was -- there was hostile -- the allegation is hostile discrimination by the union in the complaint?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1006.191,1023.396,The only factual allegation of the complaint to support that conclusory styling of the action is the allegation that the union failed to process the grievance.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.396,1024.048,"Well, --"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1024.048,1027.525,"It alleges no motive, any --"
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.525,1028.43,"Well, does it have to?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1040.984,1054.446,"Well, Your Honor pointed out that hostile discrimination, something akin to malice, actual malice, that sort of concept is of the essence of an unfair representation claim."
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1154.934,1168.782,"But if as Justice White suggested, there is some underlying hostility on the part of the union officials, the steward toward this employee, that would be a factual, would it not?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1168.782,1172.675,"If it was just personal spite and malice, I think it would be."
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1172.675,1173.002,Perhaps it isn't --
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1173.002,1175.254,There is no such allegation --
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.254,1183.886,He might have been an employee who hasn't cooperated with the union or who hasn't cooperated with the particular officers and therefore this was a retaliation.
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1186.048,1188.833,Nor does the complaint suggested or alleged it?
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.833,1191.615,Wouldn't that be a matter of proof rather than pleading?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1191.615,1207.346,"Well, if it is, there is very little left to the part of Rule 12 that authorizes the dismissal of complaints for failure to state a claim."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.346,1208.475,Well doesn't this completes --
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1208.475,1227.97,"We're not contending that that detailed facts, common law pleading, technicalities must be observed, but there must be a pleading in the complaint of the basis for the charge that is being made even though it's not actually drawn."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.97,1231.676,"Well, the complaint does allege possible discrimination?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1231.676,1240.231,It alleges the pure conclusion but alleges nothing except the mere failure to process the grievance which --
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.231,1241.411,I know but it does -- it does allege --
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1241.411,1242.634,Which they --
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.634,1247.698,"It does allege in so many words, hostile discrimination?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1247.698,1264.867,It alleges that and some -- as other picturesque language in the paragraphs against the union but no facts except the very fact of not processing the grievance.
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1357.719,1387.484,"That on the pleading question again, in addition to what Justice White has referred to about the allegation, the claim of hostile discrimination, there is an explicit allegation that the union breached its duty to the plaintiff as a member and violated the collective bargaining agreement by not representing him in the claim against the railroad."
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1394.98,1403.197,The allegation that he didn't -- that they did not represent them and prosecute their claim as a factual allegation.
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1440.031,1453.641,"Well, there are cases which have held, I don't think in this Court but there are cases in the Court of Appeals which have held that the relationship between the union and its member is in the nature of the fiduciary relationship?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1453.641,1469.918,We agree and where some factual basis alleged other than these bare statements showing that that fiduciary relationship was breached.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.802,1493.011,Could I ask you just one thing about -
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1493.011,1494.667,Yes.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.667,1503.204,"If there is a collective bargaining agreement, was there a collective bargaining agreement or this was in effect with the merger?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1503.204,1516.705,"Yes, Mr. Justice White, there of course is all was the so called scheduled agreement on these railroad setting forth the basic rates of payrolls and working conditions then when --"
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.705,1518.017,Is there anything that --
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1518.017,1521.255,Then there was an implementing agreement to implement the merger.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.255,1533.375,"Is there any thing -- is there a provision in any of the agreements which indicate that the union has a duty, a contractual duty to represent the employee before the adjustment board?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1533.375,1535.174,Not that I know off.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.174,1535.499,Would you think --
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1535.499,1558.516,"And with the union, Railroad Unions in general have maintained the proposition that they may take employee's claims to the adjustment board or they may advise them that we don't think this a claim that has much merit but you're free to take it yourselves if you want to but we won't do it at the union expense."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.516,1574.483,"Do you think the -- let's assume the union freely fits that it's a good claim but it just says we don't normally undertake this, is the employee permitted to go before the board by the law and let him go by himself?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1574.483,1575.76,Yes Your Honor.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1594.28,1606.389,"Now, under the bargaining agreement, are the pre-board steps of the grievance procedure operable by the employee himself without the union's cooperation?"
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1606.389,1619.117,"We didn't get in to that in this case, on most properties, they are, as implementing agreement is not before the Court in the record."
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.818,1631.847,Not from the union?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1631.847,1632.322,No.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.098,1635.37,So that the employee --
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1635.37,1640.765,-- 60 -- within 60 days of the time he claims is affected by the merger.
1969.234,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.329,1657.144,So the employee is not barred from the grievance procedure because the union refuses to process it?
1969.234,0,39817,richard_r_lyman,,1657.144,1660.848,No Your Honor.
1969.234,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1660.848,1662.706,Thank you Mr. Lyman.
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,1663.622,1667.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.963,2165.304,How would you get around the rule that the board has exclusive jurisdiction to pass on --
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2165.304,2166.247,Wrongful discharge?
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.247,2168.716,Yes and other grievance type of cases?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2168.716,2180.119,"Well, as I understand the Cunningham case that as the posture, the case was tried on Mr. Justice White, a wrongful discharge along with the fair representation."
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.119,2185.547,I know but somebody might tell exactly here in this Court --
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2185.547,2186.714,Right.
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.714,2196.924,"What if the Railroad which I take it would have the right under the law to take that kind of a case to the board, wasn't it?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2196.924,2199.022,That's my understanding of the law also.
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.022,2203.391,"And also, what if the Railroad says I insist on taking this to the board?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2203.391,2210.355,"Well, that would be the first time that the railroad is subject then because there is no allegation before that, they could have brought it to the board."
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.336,2230.69,Would you amend as the Court of Appeals suggest that you might --
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2230.69,2232.285,Yes sir.
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.285,2239.495,"Do I understand you to say that you concede that the railroad could take that case, the collusion case forward?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2239.495,2239.932,No.
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.932,2242.517,"You're saying only the discharge text, isn't it?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2242.517,2243.347,Correct Your Honor.
1969.234,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2260.977,2263.233,"They just want money, they want the job back?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2263.233,2267.769,They want retribution as far as money -- monetary damages are concerned here.
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.91,2280.163,But you still win your case even if you fail to win the -- even if you fail in your effort to join the company?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2280.163,2282.503,"I am not sure if I do win the case Your Honor, the --"
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.503,2286.6,"Why, why, your case is dismissed."
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2286.6,2288.08,Before the board you mean?
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2288.08,2293.1,"No, before in the Court, not dismiss the Court."
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2298.89,2299.726,No.
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.726,2300.328,No it didn't?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2300.328,2301.115,"That's correct, it did not."
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.115,2304.96,But you can still proceed against the Union even if you didn't join the employer?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2304.96,2306.752,"That's true Your Honor, I could."
1969.234,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.752,2312.863,"But your cause of action might require some kind of proof of employer participation, was it not?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2312.863,2313.354,Even more than that --
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2313.354,2314.257,Even against the union?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2314.257,2322.133,Even more than that Mr. Justice Brennan because the -- of course the discharge was precipitated by the company.
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2322.133,2327.563,So your evidence would have to go to employer conduct whether or not you amend it to --
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2327.563,2332.115,Would certainly be an evidentiary problem that District Court to do that.
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2332.115,2340.102,So you're not alleging a union caused discharge?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2340.102,2342.544,"No, because in a pure sense, the union couldn't cause it --"
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2342.544,2345.636,You just alleged remedy to discharge?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2345.636,2359.347,"Right, at least collusion on part of the union with the Railroad, to cause the loss of employment by the employees here."
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2361.164,2368.557,"Suppose, in this posture now that employer were to go to the board on the discharge case, I gather the railroad could do that, couldn't they?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2368.557,2369.249,"Yes, it's my understanding --"
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2369.249,2371.102,Even though you're not asking for reinstatement?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2371.102,2372.926,"Correct, we are not asking for reinstatement."
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2372.926,2377.926,Suppose a determination of the board favorable to the railroad?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2377.926,2383.622,Then these employees are out of the picture as far as the railroad is concerned.
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2383.622,2390.462,"Well, What's the bearing of a determination of the board in favor of the railroad upon your lawsuit against the union?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2390.462,2393.208,"I just said, as far as the railroad is concerned."
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2394.282,2395.593,You still have your cause of action?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2395.593,2407.03,"The case against the union, it's my understanding, we're still allowed to sue the union but again it's a practical problem, it's an evidentiary problem as far as these employees are concerned."
1969.234,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2418.08,2428.875,I expect there might be -- you don't concede there might be any kind of question at all about your lawsuit against the union if the board were to find in favor of the railroad?
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2428.875,2436.329,"Well, that's the reason I didn't want to go to the board naturally because the board is comprised of members of the union and the company."
1969.234,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2469.593,2478.214,"Well, if you want to you could decline the option that the Court of Appeals gave you and maintain the action against the union only, couldn't you?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2478.214,2479.492,I could Your Honor.
1969.234,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2479.492,2485.623,"And then except for the statutes of limitations if you didn't prevail there, you could seek against the railroad?"
1969.234,1,32759,james_p_shea,,2485.623,2512.137,"Which is very important in this case, the statute of limitations because of course it lays a point over the Court, it's almost 8 years old is the case now and my understanding of the procedure of the National Railroad Adjustment Board that's quite time consuming there as far as getting before the board and getting a decision."
1969.234,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2521.522,2527.679,Thank you Mr. Shea.
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2530.73,2535.186,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court."
1969.234,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.682,2583.346,Mr. Griffin.
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2583.346,2584.311,Yes.
1969.234,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.311,2586.854,"The railroad hasn't caused petitioned here, has it?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2586.854,2587.923,No Your Honor.
1969.234,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.923,2594.804,Are you objecting to a leave aloud the petitioners to other employees rather to amend?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2594.804,2596.092,Am I objecting to that?
1969.234,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.092,2597.046,Yes.
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2597.046,2597.881,Yes Your Honor.
1969.234,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.881,2603.49,"Well, how can you -- you didn't cross petition that against you, did you?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2603.49,2604.459,No I did not --
1969.234,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.459,2610.823,"The only as I understand it, all we have here is the union's petition, isn't that all?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2610.823,2613.849,That's correct in terms of a petition Your Honor.
1969.234,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2613.849,2618.192,What you mean is that you don't like it but you happen to be -- you haven't asked us to review it?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2618.192,2621.334,No I haven't filed any formal petition.
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2663.313,2665.872,"But Mr. Griffin, you're a respondent, aren't you?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2665.872,2666.489,That's correct Your Honor.
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2666.489,2674.179,"Ordinarily, a respondent is here defending the judgment below, isn't he?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2674.179,2675.065,Yes.
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2675.065,2683.105,"And you're here attacking the judgment insofar as amendment against the railroad was permitted, aren't you?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2683.105,2685.008,"In part, that's my purpose Your Honor, yes."
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2685.008,2685.463,Yes.
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2685.463,2702.242,I think that the -- it's my position that the gratuitous none asked for permission to start in effect another lawsuit against the railroad that the Second Circuit gave was improper and unnecessary and --.
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2702.242,2712.523,My question is whether you can bring that to us without having cross petition against the judgment which gave that leave to the -- your co-respondents?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2712.523,2718.916,"It's a good question and I'm frank to say that Your Honor, I'm not able to authoritatively respond."
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2748.599,2756.669,"Why would you ever -- class as a respondent in this case anyway, because you didn't petition, is that it?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2756.669,2757.961,"Well, I'm -- I was originally --"
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2757.961,2760.077,"Or a petitioner you're a respondent, is that it?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2760.077,2760.592,That's right.
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2762.896,2763.348,"Yes, and you --"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2763.348,2765.779,--then I was an appellee in the --
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2765.779,2769.237,And you wanted to sustain the District Court's judgment of dismissal?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2769.237,2770.671,That's correct insofar -- .
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2770.671,2774.914,And the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and you objected to that?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2774.914,2776.195,That is correct.
1969.234,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2777.805,2780.421,You and the union argued together in the Court of Appeals?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2780.421,2781.473,That's correct.
1969.234,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2804.474,2806.478,When you say gratuitously --
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2806.478,2808.987,Well no one asked for it.
1969.234,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2812.855,2822.377,"But there it is Mr. Griffin, it's a judgment and it's a judgment adverse to you and you have an appeal from it, part of it that is adverse to you, have you?"
1969.234,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2822.377,2824.938,Are you sharing respondent's time here?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2824.938,2828.379,"Yes, we made an application."
1969.234,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.379,2829.578,For additional time?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2829.578,2834.113,To divide the time Your Honor.
1969.234,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2878.986,2883.929,"Of course Mr. Griffin, if the employees don't amend as against the railroad, you have the case anyway, aren't you?"
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2883.929,2884.986,That's right.
1969.234,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2887.052,2890.588,I wonder why you're here at all if I --
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2890.588,2891.06,"Well, if I knew --"
1969.234,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2891.06,2892.014,Or despite the --
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2892.014,2892.187,Your Honor --
1969.234,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.187,2893.916,I don't understand why you're here at all?
1969.234,2,39405,richard_f_griffin,,2893.916,2946.328,"Well, If I knew that the union in its brief did not suggest that this Court should make some adverse determination and maybe keep us in the lawsuit, then as far as that part of it, I wouldn't be here and I think that it's quite clear that we shouldn't be in the lawsuit and as I think Justice White developed in the question, this employee had all the chance in the world to go before the adjustment board, his counsel for years, his counsel decided not to go to the adjustment board and that was -- he had every opportunity in the world, there was nothing to prevent him but he didn't want to go there and this Court has consistently held that the Railway Labor Act provides exclusive remedy and has an obligation to go there."
1969.234,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3059.071,3064.626,Mr. Lyman you have three minutes left.
1969.234,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3064.626,3068.19,Why did you make the railroad respondents Mr. Lyman?
1969.234,3,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3068.19,3084.301,Because the Court of Appeals left us as the sole defendants to defend against a charge claimed for damages based on the acts of the railroad company and not on our acts.
1969.234,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3088.627,3089.482,"Well, you're --"
1969.234,3,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3089.482,3092.548,--we're out of it and we have to say their burden according to --
1969.234,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3092.548,3103.268,"Well, your complaint is that instead of limiting the relief to the employees to amend on grounds of collusion against the railroad, you wanted the railroad what, make something else?"
1969.234,3,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3108.203,3131.775,"Under Vaca against Sipes, the Court made it very clear that the railroad cannot slip its burden off paying for its wrongful breach of contract off under the labor unions simply in a situation were like here, the union did not process the claim for the employees to complain about what the railroad had done."
1969.234,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3131.775,3133.18,"Well, let me see if I get it right."
1969.234,3,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3138.984,3140.627,Yes.
1969.234,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3140.627,3144.734,"Well, if one has been, then you're --"
1969.234,3,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3144.734,3144.832,Then we'll --
1969.234,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3144.832,3149.056,"-- entitled to have the union of the employer as a full co-defendant, is that it?"
1969.234,3,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3149.056,3155.725,"Yes, because their damages cannot properly be placed upon the union."
1969.234,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3224.799,3233.121,One thing that does emerge here is that the Court of Appeals thought that these pleadings stated the cause of action against the union.
1969.234,3,39817,richard_r_lyman,,3236.686,3260.555,"Yes Your Honor and we think and we submit that they did not do so against the union and we've argued that at some length in our brief and decided, decisions from the Sixth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Tenth Circuit which I very clearly contrary to the holding of this Court of Appeals."
1969.234,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3260.555,3261.607,Thank you Mr. Lyman.
