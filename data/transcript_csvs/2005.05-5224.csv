2005.05-5224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.985,We'll hear argument first today in Davis v. Washington.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5.391,12.783,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,57.434,58.513,"Counsel, when you say--"
2005.05-5224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,58.513,61.763,How does the fact that it's sole proof mean that it's testimonial?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,61.763,63.545,It--
2005.05-5224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,63.545,71.234,"I... it... it adds to the general appeal of your case I... I suppose, but what does that have to do with whether or not it's testimonial?"
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,71.234,73.608,--It doesn't... it doesn't answer one way or another whether it's testimonial.
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,88.018,94.754,"--But you did use the word inquisitorial, and there's one large difference, it seems."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,109.804,113.18,Let... let me address that question in two parts.
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,118.932,120.088,"No, I didn't say that."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,120.088,120.682,I'm sorry.
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.682,123.714,I said that the call was initiated by the victim.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,128.901,129.606,I see.
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,170.333,174.412,You're splitting up two things that I think go together.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,180.68,194.807,"Well, there... in... in a sense, of course, Ms. McCottry is seeking help at the same time she's reporting a crime, but the... the mere fact that the two are intertwined does not take us outside the Confrontation Clause."
2005.05-5224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,234.581,237.909,Is it your argument that any statement made to law enforcement is testimonial?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,237.909,242.802,"Well, you certainly don't have to go that far in this case, Your Honor, but... but we believe--"
2005.05-5224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,242.802,245.223,I thought that's what you said in your argument when you started off.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,245.223,250.304,--Certainly any statement describing criminal activity to a law enforcement officer would be testimonial.
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,250.304,262.04,"Well, you started out by saying that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to keep out the accusations made out of court, but I would have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay rule."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,267.667,274.449,"The purpose of the hearsay rule, Justice Breyer, is to police the reliability of out of court statements."
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,281.372,287.811,"Ah, so it's not the purpose of the Confrontation Clause to keep out out of court accusations."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,292.485,300.549,"Well, we believe the rule is, is that any accusatory statement to a law enforcement officer or to an agent of the law... of law enforcement--"
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,300.549,305.627,"I know you do believe that, but I want to know why in terms of the purposes of not the hearsay--"
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,305.627,306.738,"--Well, the--"
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,306.738,308.159,--rather the confrontation.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,308.159,322.568,"--the history of the confrontation right, going back even prior to the framer, was to bring the accuser and the accused face to face so that the accuser made his or her accusation in the presence of the accused and subject to cross examination."
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.591,364.468,"Suppose I point the finger in an affidavit, and I just send the affidavit, you know."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,378.033,379.908,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia, I--"
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.908,388.551,So your... your thesis that it applies to just accusatory statements to a law enforcement officer has to be expanded a little.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,388.551,393.694,"--It does, and what I'm giving you is a... a rule that I think is the kernel, the heart of the confrontation right."
2005.05-5224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,395.85,398.757,"Well, what about... what if you... what if somebody runs out of the... the house?"
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,415.479,445.173,"--I think that statements law enforcement officer merely overhear may not be testimonial, and one of the reasons for that is this Court's Bourjaily decision, which it cited with approval in Crawford, is if somebody make... if somebody makes statements that tend out... that turn out to be incriminating in a criminal case, the mere fact that they're overheard by law enforcement officers or even an undercover officer eliciting the statement is in a different scenario, Mr. Chief Justice, than somebody making a statement to law enforcement or even... and I want to make sure I understand your hypothetical."
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.632,474.117,What was she calling 911 for if she didn't want help?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,474.117,476.195,Well--
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.195,478.43,"I mean, she... she wanted something from 911."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,484.18,487.088,"--I think that's a fair inference, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.092,512.953,"You said... you said we don't know, but you... that's slightly in conflict with what you said earlier."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,523.956,526.082,"It's about 4 minutes, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-5224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,550.602,556.056,"Well, I thought that was... I thought that was to determine if there were outstanding orders and warrants against the individual."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,556.056,559.166,"--It may be, and that may be another example, Mr. Chief Justice, of a... of a--"
2005.05-5224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,559.166,569.387,But that's related... that's related to sending people to prevent crime as opposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,569.387,577.357,"--I don't want to dispute that 911 operators in this situation, just like responding officers, are gathering information for dual purposes."
2005.05-5224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,611.865,622.79,"Well, what if the only question... what if a 911 caller says nothing more than, in a very excited way, someone is attacking me, send a police officer right away to make the person stop attacking me?"
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,624.149,631.901,"--To the extent that the person is saying someone is attacking me, that kernel may... may well be testimonial, Justice Alito."
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,648.389,658.376,But a simple cry for help that doesn't say I'm being battered may not elicit an immediate response on the part of the police.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,670.455,683.882,"I think that's a fair inference, but the... the priority attention, in terms of going and apprehending Mr. Davis, is exactly what triggers criminal justice system and exactly what makes the kind of a statement, the one that the... one that the Confrontation Clause should care about."
2005.05-5224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,683.882,684.913,Do you have any--
2005.05-5224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,684.913,687.788,"Well, they're not sending someone... they're not sending someone to apprehend Mr. Davis."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,691.914,696.524,"I'm not sure it's easy to separate one from the other, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-5224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.526,707.76,May I ask this question?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,716.982,718.763,"--No, Justice Stevens."
2005.05-5224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,745.63,765.867,"--Well, in doing that, do you distinguish, for example, between the... the expectation that lies behind a merely excited utterance, on the one hand, and the expectation or lack of expectation that would qualify... that would be the case in a... in a true res gestae statement in the very strict sense?"
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,798.203,798.64,--The latter--
2005.05-5224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.64,799.359,--under your theory?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,799.359,800.343,--I'm sorry.
2005.05-5224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,800.343,800.656,I'm sorry.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,802.187,804.204,"The latter is a very close case, Justice Souter."
2005.05-5224,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,832.397,843.463,So that the answer to my question is there would be no distinction between the merely excited utterance 30 seconds later and the utterance in the course of in... in my hypo.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,843.463,849.652,"We believe that as long as it is making a report to a third party, there ought not be a distinction."
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.246,857.075,"--You say according to your reading of the cases, but you really don't have a case like this."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,883.753,887.238,"--Well, Justice Scalia, of course, we didn't have telephone technology, so--"
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.238,892.301,You could have... you could have somebody walking by... a policeman walking by outside.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,892.301,893.239,--Yes.
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.239,898.255,"And the victim shouting, you know, please, somebody help me, Harry is beating me."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,919.542,921.948,"Well, for two reasons, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.589,927.621,"Yes, but that's not this case."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,927.621,927.996,And we think the fair--
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.996,928.309,That--
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,928.309,941.641,"--It's not exactly on all fours with this case, but we think the fair inference, when you read the treatises and the reasons why those kinds of statements were kept out, is that if they simply... if the police or their agents were able to get the statement just a little bit sooner, the answer would have been the same."
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.363,966.082,--Because of the... because of the Confrontation Clause you think?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,966.082,972.99,"--Well, I... I think it's a fair inference, Justice Scalia, from reading the historical precedent and the treatises that describe it."
2005.05-5224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1043.505,1044.739,"Well, that's not... that's not true at all."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1056.398,1062.447,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think you got to the heart of the matter when you said that if it's a good witness, the prosecutor will put them on."
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.467,1087.015,"Well, I assume the defendant could summon that... that witness if... if that witness' location was known."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1087.984,1088.781,"Well, the defendant--"
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.781,1092.562,"And could find out from the prosecution where that witness was, I assume."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1092.562,1094.969,--The defendant might be able to do that.
2005.05-5224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.254,1110.925,But Justice Scalia's question raises the... the point.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1128.102,1133.009,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think your assumption may not be entirely correct."
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1149.373,1158.108,Is there... is there... suppose the defendant procured the witness' absence by a threat.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1158.108,1161.75,Yes.
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1161.75,1164.922,Then the 911 statement could come in.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1165.672,1166.031,That's right.
2005.05-5224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1207.258,1209.118,But those are... those are three neat legal categories.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1234.093,1238.859,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't want to be insensitive to... to witnesses in this situation."
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1266.724,1267.741,How would you do that?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1269.147,1270.179,--Pardon me?
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1270.179,1270.913,How would you do that?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1292.214,1297.403,"Well, that's already what happens under the Federal Rules of Evidence and under the evidence of many States, that there is a rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing."
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1298.169,1298.794,I understand that.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1309.187,1309.655,--I'm not--
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.655,1312.704,And we suspect that she's afraid of her husband.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1332.504,1333.63,"--Well, I think--"
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.63,1334.161,How does it work?
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1334.161,1344.149,"--Well, I think we have... Justice Breyer, like in lots of other scenarios, you have a pretrial hearing, and at that pretrial hearing, of course, the rules of evidence don't strictly apply the way they would in the guilt phase."
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.652,1384.892,Maybe we should just... just suspend the Confrontation Clause in spousal abuse cases instead of designing the entire application of the Confrontation Clause everywhere on the basis of what seems to be a special problem in spousal abuse cases.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1384.892,1389.33,"--Well, of course, Justice Scalia, the Sixth Amendment says all criminal prosecutions--"
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.33,1389.767,I understand.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1389.767,1391.721,--and domestic violence cases are criminal prosecutions.
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.533,1399.222,"And I suppose we could also have said that the Sixth Amendment, like some other amendments, doesn't apply to State prosecutions--"
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1399.222,1400.519,"--That's right, but we--"
2005.05-5224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.519,1413.006,"--or the Confrontation Clause portion of that, anyway, which would exempt spousal abuse cases, by and large, until we... until we enact a Federal spousal abuse statute, which... which may well occur."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1427.212,1428.713,--I think that's a fair comment.
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1445.686,1447.999,"This is true, but the reason I thought spousal abuse cases are relevant--"
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1447.999,1448.92,--Pardon me?
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1448.92,1452.671,--A reason I thought they were relevant is just what you're about to address.
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1485.413,1486.319,"That's right, Justice Breyer, but--"
2005.05-5224,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.319,1499.12,"And so that is a problem that you have to address in respect to drawing a fairly narrow line, and I want to know what that narrow line is with spousal abuse and other cases in mind."
2005.05-5224,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1499.12,1504.183,"--Let me give you two ways this case, if... if we assume the State's version of the events is correct, could have easily been proved."
2005.05-5224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1560.007,1561.696,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1566.446,1569.806,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.73,1584.028,Like what is his name?
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1594.312,1599.11,"No, a number of other questions, Justice Scalia, were answered... were asked in the present... present tense too."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.884,1641.29,"You know, powerful is part of the problem."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1670.453,1680.283,"Well, I'd respectfully disagree, Your Honor, although I'd... I'd first note that... that I think the if clause in Your Honor's question is telling."

2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1690.224,1692.02,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and... and--"
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.02,1696.427,Rather than have her... her voice on the telephone call--
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1696.427,1697.287,"--Well, if I had to--"
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.287,1705.367,--when she is... she is in... in... supposedly in great fear of... of her husband and... and... I'm sure you'd rather have the telephone call.
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1705.367,1707.164,--If you're asking me which would I choose--
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.164,1708.18,As a prosecutor.
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1708.18,1713.743,"--Well, if I had to choose, that would be a difficult choice, obviously, but our plan, of course, was to--"
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.743,1714.462,It may be an easier choice.
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1714.462,1723.137,"--Our... our plan was to do both, and it wasn't until the eve of trial that we learned that the complaining witness, Ms. McCottry, wasn't going to appear."
2005.05-5224,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.934,1727.56,Did... did you subpoena her at that point?
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1727.56,1732.623,"--She was already subpoenaed, Your Honor, and the prosecutor brought in the detective."
2005.05-5224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1756.566,1766.333,"Counsel, your... your position is not that anything that she says or anything anyone says in a 911 call is... is consistent with the Confrontation Clause."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1766.333,1767.239,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2005.05-5224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1772.694,1774.6,So what is your... what is your test?
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1780.711,1789.98,"Our focus, Your Honor, is, as I think this Court focused in Crawford on whether or not the government's practice resembles the inquisitorial abuses."
2005.05-5224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1801.904,1807.514,"Mr. Fisher tells us that's exactly what happens, that the 911 operator goes through the elements of the crime in a very structured way."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1807.514,1814.547,"Well, I... I think if you listen to the tape itself, you'll conclude that's not the case."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.159,1827.8,Let's... let's not overread Crawford.
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1859.792,1874.888,"Well, it may not have, Your Honor, but the... under the test that we're proposing, the... we're placing the focus on situations like this, situations roughly analogous... situations that are distinguishable from what you had with Sylvia Crawford."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.142,1891.751,Your test wouldn't cover the example I just gave.
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1891.751,1893.736,"--No, that's right, Your Honor."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.08,1896.768,And you think that that should be admissible in a criminal trial?
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1896.768,1897.205,"--No, I don't."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.846,1898.221,Well--
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1898.221,1901.675,"--that should be inadmissible, but it should be inadmissible because of the rules of hearsay."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.817,1911.583,"--Oh, if the person disappears afterwards, is unavailable."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1911.583,1913.786,Fair enough.
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.447,1933.744,I can't imagine that that wouldn't have been covered by the Confrontation Clause--
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1933.744,1934.182,--Well--
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.182,1948.903,"--such... such an obvious violation of your right to confront your accuser, and just because it was presented to the police without... without an initial interrogation by the police, I don't think that would have made any difference at common law."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1948.903,1973.487,"--And... and, Your Honor, it may be that at some point the Court expands the definition in... in Crawford of testimonial... formalized testimonial materials to include something like that, but I think that in situations where you have an encounter between police and a citizen and statements result, then I think it's fair to focus on the interaction and whether or not the... the person was trying to shape the testimony."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.487,1983.411,"I agree that that's the extreme, but you're urging us to... to adopt a test that embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the hypothetical I just gave you."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,1992.444,1997.227,"Well, Your Honor, as I say, the test we're proposing I think would cover the majority of cases."
2005.05-5224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2034.578,2051.393,"Why don't you incorporate what the Solicitor General has suggested, that is, you draw the line at urgent emergency statements that are calling for... for immediate help?"
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2051.393,2075.257,"We certainly don't have any objections to the Solicitor General's approach, Your Honor, and... and in fact, in some ways, because we're analyzing a case like this that arose in an emergency circumstance, I think that it's clear that... that statements that are made in those circumstances, just by their very nature, aren't going to be testimonial."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.185,2113.345,"What... what do we do about the... about the fact, which I don't think you... you deny and... and the... the other side points out in both of these cases that, in fact, police departments have their responders to the 911 number intentionally ask a series of questions that gives them all the information they need to conduct a prosecution?"
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2119.752,2123.894,"Well, I think that overstates the empirical evidence, Your Honor."
2005.05-5224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.406,2181.907,"Did... did she wait until after the 4 minutes to call the police, or did she... she have the police on the way after the first minute?"
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2181.907,2186.97,"--It sounds as though that she dispatched them immediately, Your Honor, because--"
2005.05-5224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2186.97,2189.674,She... she's just typed that out on the computer or something like that?
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2189.674,2190.064,--That's right.
2005.05-5224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2241.732,2250.405,And she's... she's in ongoing... the operator is in ongoing contact with the people she's... the operator has dispatched.
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2250.484,2256.657,"Correct, Your Honor, and that's why... that's why ordinarily the operator doesn't terminate the call until the police have arrived on the scene."
2005.05-5224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.206,2270.52,What do you have to say about the failure to inquire about Mike?
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2270.52,2274.989,"Your Honor, I... I don't think that's as significant as petitioner suggests."
2005.05-5224,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2405.486,2407.267,How... how often does this happen?
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2420.021,2425.459,"--Your Honor, I do... I cannot answer in a percentage terms how often this happens."
2005.05-5224,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2435.383,2443.384,"But... but I'm talking about the witness who is not merely reluctant, but simply doesn't show up and you make reasonable efforts and you... and you can't find the witness."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2444.15,2448.48,"--As I say, I'm... I'm hard pressed to give a... a percentage number."
2005.05-5224,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.512,2453.059,Has it happened to you before?
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2453.059,2455.075,--I believe it has.
2005.05-5224,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2455.075,2456.732,But you don't know how many times.
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2456.732,2458.247,"I can't say, no, Your Honor."
2005.05-5224,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2461.467,2474.328,"So we're not... I take it we're not in a position whereby if we hold against you, we are, in effect, nullifying the possibility of enforcing domestic violence laws by criminal process."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2474.328,2491.895,"--Well, I... I think the other factor that has to be considered, Your Honor, is as soon... as soon as defendants realize that merely pressuring the victim into not appearing will put an end to the case, then it gives the defendant the increased incentive to put the pressure on the victim and cases that otherwise would have pled won't."
2005.05-5224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.723,2493.629,Disappearing.
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2495.348,2498.224,--Yes.
2005.05-5224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2498.802,2499.912,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-5224,1,33623,james_m_whisman,,2499.912,2500.475,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.05-5224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2500.475,2509.711,Mr. Dreeben.
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2509.711,2512.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2598.339,2598.777,"Well, maybe."
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2620.892,2641.787,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we would distinguish between those kinds of 911 calls where someone is seeking protection from an imminent or present threat to their safety and a 911 call that's making a more generalized report of criminal activity or a desire for safety and maybe speaking in a narrative form about the past."
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.787,2647.788,"Well, the husband had left the house here, as I understand it, when this... when this call occurred."
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2647.788,2649.007,"Actually, Justice--"
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.007,2652.336,"She... she wanted the man arrested, but he was no longer in the house, was he?"
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2652.336,2661.088,"--Actually, Justice Scalia, I believe when the call begins, the caller is speaking in the present tense and says, he's here jumping on me again."
2005.05-5224,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2691.094,2698.127,"And what... what's your position if she says he beat me 2 minutes ago, he's left, and he's running down the block?"
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2698.127,2703.894,"--I think in that situation, Justice Kennedy, there is still an imminent threatened potential of a recurrence."
2005.05-5224,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2735.416,2741.058,"Well, suppose... suppose it's a thief, and she said he's taken the diamond necklace and he's running... and he's running away."
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2742.683,2748.825,--That... that situation would not fall within the emergency rule that the Government is arguing for today.
2005.05-5224,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2752.529,2761.547,"So the... the jewelry store owner who reports to the... the police is fleeing on a 911, that... that's not... that's not admissible under your view?"
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2761.547,2762.282,--No.
2005.05-5224,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.472,2778.941,"Well, what... what about the... my hypothetical?"
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2778.941,2786.755,We would submit that that is not testimonial within the meaning of Crawford for many of the same reasons that... that are present in this case.
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.178,2790.226,What do you mean by seeking help?
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2804.259,2806.275,Well--
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.275,2809.432,"And... and in the... in the jeweler case, the guy is running down the street."
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2816.215,2824.343,--The urgency certainly in... in the jewelry thief hypothetical does deal with apprehending the person who has just stolen the goods.
2005.05-5224,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2830.406,2839.877,But I'm concerned about the rule you're arguing today because it... it seems to me there's a good case for allowing the... the statements by the jewelry store operator.
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2839.877,2841.502,--I think there is a good--
2005.05-5224,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2841.502,2845.675,"And... and I want to know what your position is so that you don't come back next week and say, well, now we want the jewelry store--"
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2845.675,2853.677,"--Well, I'm not going to say that we wouldn't, depending on how the Court analyzes this case, argue for a submission that that's not--"
2005.05-5224,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2853.677,2856.396,--We've got to... you analyze the case now and then we'll analyze it later.
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2857.959,2868.961,--What the Court needs to analyze today is whether an emergency statement where somebody is seeking protection and there is a threat of imminent recurrence of the very violence that has triggered the call is testimony.
2005.05-5224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2926.568,2940.085,"What do you say in that respect about the blue brief's reference to 17th century cases, the hue and the cry where someone went out and told the sheriff, help, I'm being beaten up, and that that evidence wasn't admissible?"
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2940.085,2946.68,"Well, I think what's really striking, Justice Breyer, is that there is no 17th century case law that reflects that."
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.554,3014.602,"Well, it's... it's... it may be not a lot, but it's something."
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3016.837,3018.478,--What we have--
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.478,3023.635,"You don't have anything which shows that these hue and cry reports were admitted, and there were a lot of them."
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3025.26,3041.904,"--The hue and cry reports, Justice Scalia, as I think your earlier questioning suggested, do not necessarily involve the kind of emergency situation what... that we have here where a person is reaching out from an ongoing present criminal act against them and seeking help."
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3059.674,3067.832,I would say that a hue and cry report is not the same as a woman being beaten and... and picking up the phone while the crime is progress.
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3101.089,3106.762,"Justice Scalia, first of all, there is evidence that the hue and cry practice existed."
2005.05-5224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3184.483,3188.358,"Mr. Dreeben, you say focus on the emergency nature."
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3209.457,3222.929,"It is, Mr. Chief Justice, in the sense that it's information that's needed to respond to and resolve the imminent threat to this woman's safety, which would certainly occur if the individual decided to come back and finish what he'd started."
2005.05-5224,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3252.341,3260.296,"Well, rather than build that into the law, it might be wiser to deal with Justice Kennedy's case, in whatever system we come up with, explaining it."
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3264.124,3287.005,My... my view on that is that the kinds of statements that are made in the immediate report of a crime are really in the form of excited utterances that are much different from the kind of dispassionate testimony that occurs after the fact that prompted the confrontation right.
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.81,3330.014,And you wouldn't say that every question asked in that context.
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3340.658,3341.267,I think that--
2005.05-5224,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.267,3342.689,--as an excited utterance?
2005.05-5224,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3342.689,3358.677,"--the more that the... the questioning begins to delve into a past narrative of past criminal activity, the more there is a reason to think that it serves, in addition to its protection purpose, an evidentiary purpose."
2005.05-5224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.939,3415.673,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2005.05-5224,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3418.736,3419.658,Thank you.
2005.05-5224,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3456.869,3457.197,That may be hearsay.
2005.05-5224,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3458.338,3461.479,"It... it is what it is, Justice Breyer."
2005.05-5224,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3650.364,3651.38,I have one last question.
2005.05-5224,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3656.318,3662.288,"Well, this Court noticed that Professor Wigmore had the view that the Confrontation Clause applied only to witnesses that actually took the stand."
2005.05-5224,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3678.854,3682.854,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
