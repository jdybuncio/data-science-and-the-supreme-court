1989.88-1353,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.389,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1353, United States v. Rene Martin Verdugo-Orquidez."
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,18.613,22.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1353,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,32.752,36.524,"Overseas is a little strong for Mexicali, isn't it?"
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,40.808,42.688,--Indeed it is.
1989.88-1353,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,42.688,47.312,"--exaggerate in your first statement, your first sentence, for pete's sake."
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,47.312,54.488,"Well, it's extraterritorial."
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,169.488,170.629,"Mr. Robbins, may I just ask this question?"
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,174.342,176.945,"--As far as we know, he did, Your Honor."
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,201.299,206.784,"In other words, in Mexico the executive branch of the government has full authority to conduct whatever searches it thinks necessary."
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,209.846,209.976,--Well--
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.976,211.619,--Is that your submission?
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,211.619,215.012,"--No... well, our submission, Justice Stevens, of course,--"
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,215.012,220.605,"Well, you said with the full authority of the Mexican official... I take it you're meaning it was clearly in compliance with Mexican law."
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,220.605,222.097,"--No, as--"
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,222.097,226.06,"I mean, would it matter if they asked the corner policeman, do you mind if we go in and search this house?"
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,226.71,238.937,"--Well, I think it's possible that if the facts were very different from the ones we have here, it could be that asking someone who obviously has no authority or apparent authority would present a different case."
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,241.558,246.883,"I mean, we don't know whether Mexican law requires anything like a warrant procedure or judicial participation--"
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,246.883,247.094,--Well--
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,247.094,249.197,--in the authority to conduct the search of a private home.
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,249.197,257.014,--We do know that Article 16 of the Mexican constitution purports to require a warrant under certain circumstances.
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.028,297.472,What I'm really asking... you emphasized in your presentation that it was done with the permission of the Mexican authorities.
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,297.472,297.642,Correct.
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,297.642,299.896,And I'm wondering if that is essential to your position.
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,306.009,307.171,I don't--
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.171,309.301,--I just wonder how relevant it is to the analysis.
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,309.301,313.986,"--Well, I think that the fact that there was permission--"
1989.88-1353,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,313.986,316.908,By somebody.
1989.88-1353,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,316.908,333.097,"--Well, by someone who it was reasonable to suppose... reasonable to suppose... had the authority that they were conveying is relevant in our view to whether the search was reasonable, if you assume that the Fourth Amendment governs that search."
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1633.09,1637.333,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.477,1689.19,Do you think the Ninth Circuit was mindful of that rule?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1689.19,1703.72,"I think that the precise rule that we could draw from the case... yes, my answer would be yes, that the precise rule we could draw from that case is that since, in this case, there was no exigency to prevent the officers from getting a warrant, they should have got a warrant."
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.185,1711.166,"Who do you think they should have gotten that warrant from, in particular?"
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1711.166,1711.977,I don't think--
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.977,1712.518,Puerto Rico?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1712.518,1716.262,--I don't think it's a difficult question.
1989.88-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.566,1743.011,It's the defendant's presence in the Southern District... you don't give notice to him of a motion to file a search warrant.
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1743.011,1758.753,"--No, but if you want to go to a magistrate... and that's how I understood the question... what magistrate would you logically go to or which judge... I would think that since the agent, the defendant, and the prosecuting authority were all in the Southern District of California, it would certainly make sense to go there."
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.436,1763.026,"Well, it's as good as any."
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1763.026,1764.618,"--Well, also, I think--"
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.618,1779.838,You don't think the Mexican authorities would be a little bit annoyed with an American official issuing a document that authorizes an American law enforcement officer to search their territory?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1782.92,1794.57,--I think they would be very annoyed if that document was presented to them by the agents as something that said this gives us the right vis-a-vis the Government of the Republic of Mexico to take action in Mexico.
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.681,1821.791,"Well, that's an unusual warrant then, isn't it?"
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1839.804,1846.669,"In that sense it is different, but requiring a warrant fulfills the same purposes--"
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.669,1846.927,"No, it--"
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1846.927,1849.22,--as having a warrant in the United States.
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.011,1854.245,"--It may be but it's not a warrant as we have generally known warrants, what you're talking about."
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1854.245,1857.538,--It certainly has the difference that the Justice has mentioned.
1989.88-1353,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1857.538,1865.124,"In fact, Counsel, it would be rather odd, wouldn't it, for this Court to require the issuance of a warrant that's not permitted by the rules?"
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1865.124,1869.455,"No, I think it is permitted pursuant to Rule 41."
1989.88-1353,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.377,1872.059,Is the... well let's look at that.
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1876.674,1879.746,--That would be true if we just looked at Rule 41(a).
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.52,1954.794,Do you have cases that say they have authority to issue it beyond their jurisdiction?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,1958.226,1960.55,There is no case that says that they can or cannot.
1989.88-1353,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.061,2003.371,"No, but, you know, if you want to... if you are trying a person in the Southern District of California and you want to search his house in Tucson, you don't get a warrant from... who do you get the warrant from?"
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2003.371,2006.764,It would be the magistrate in Tucson or the court in Tucson?
1989.88-1353,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.764,2007.455,Why?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2007.455,2012.62,I think because Rule 41(a) talks about specifically--
1989.88-1353,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.62,2013.619,"Well, it is territorial then, isn't it?"
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2013.619,2014.15,--Pardon me?
1989.88-1353,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.15,2015.472,It is territorial.
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2015.472,2016.824,Rule 41(a) is.
1989.88-1353,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.131,2032.158,"Well, it restricts it in the sense that a warrant issued in Southern California wouldn't authorize a search in Tucson."
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2032.158,2042.877,"--That's correct, but I don't think it would restrict a court from issuing a warrant to search or a finding of probable cause to search a residence in Mexicali in Mexico."
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.031,2077.112,Is a warrant in this record?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2077.112,2078.152,There is no warrant.
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.152,2088.551,"I mean, what... whatever papers that the United States officers used, are they... copies of them in this record?"
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2088.551,2091.103,"Justice Marshall, there were no papers."
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2096.818,2099.85,What are we talking about a warrant for?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2099.85,2104.885,"--Whether or not they should be required to get a warrant, and we're saying that they should have been required to obtain a warrant."
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2106.377,2108.939,They should have been required to obtain a warrant?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2108.939,2109.339,Yes.
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2109.339,2111.361,And what would the warrant say?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2111.361,2124.94,"That the... it would specifically identify the places to be searched, list specifically the items that could be seized, and specifically set--"
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2124.94,2128.063,Would that have any relation to the laws of Mexico?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2128.063,2145.325,"--Well, in fact it would, because the Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of Mexico is very similar to our own warrant requirement and specifically requires that a search warrant be obtained."
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2157.551,2163.037,"Well, I thought he said that they checked with some assistant attorney general or somebody."
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2163.037,2170.463,"--Well, they checked with another law enforcement official and they said we'd like to search and this fellow police officer said, sure, we'll help you out."
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2185.575,2190.738,Then I assume the agents are guilty of violating your client's rights.
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2190.738,2191.739,That's correct.
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.739,2193.179,And subject--
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2197.213,2201.166,No civil suit was ever filed in Mexico that I know about.
1989.88-1353,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.166,2202.157,Or any place?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2202.157,2204.779,No... no... I know of no civil suit.
1989.88-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.779,2211.133,So he did not seek to vindicate the rights you say were denied under Mexican law?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2211.133,2214.216,He did not seek to sue U.S. agents.
1989.88-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.797,2218.811,Did he seek to sue the Mexican agents whom you say violated his rights?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2218.811,2220.313,--I don't believe that he did.
1989.88-1353,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2229.181,2244.148,"Suppose we think the warrant requirement does not extend to searches beyond our borders, would we then have to... if the Fourth Amendment applies... look to a reasonableness test?"
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2244.148,2244.9,Well--
1989.88-1353,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2244.9,2246.633,And how would you measure that?
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2252.055,2252.426,--No.
1989.88-1353,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2283.117,2284.118,"Well, we understand your argument."
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2285.84,2286.0,Yes.
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.721,2321.264,I don't understand that.
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2329.381,2350.706,"--Well, it was considered by the district court in that had he contacted some official, he might have realized, one, that there was a warrant requirement in Mexico that he could have complied with; he might have learned that as far as the Department of Justice is concerned maybe a warrant or an order of probable cause should be obtained here."
1989.88-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2364.256,2372.243,"The traditional rule... an objective test... you know, if you're right objectively, I thought it didn't make any difference how many people you consulted."
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2378.618,2384.544,"--Well, we are saying that he was wrong objectively in that he didn't comply at least with the warrant requirements--"
1989.88-1353,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.544,2387.016,But the failure to consult adds nothing to the objective.
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2387.016,2394.453,"--We urge that had he consulted, he might have learned that there was a warrant requirement in Mexico."
1989.88-1353,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.438,2402.359,--to know if his supervisors were smarter than he was.
1989.88-1353,1,36462,michael_pancer,,2410.746,2411.384,--Okay.
1989.88-1353,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3320.404,3322.514,Very briefly.
1989.88-1353,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3439.947,3440.698,And didn't one of the officers secure an automobile?
1989.88-1353,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3440.698,3442.149,I'm sorry?
1989.88-1353,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.149,3443.982,And didn't one of the officers secure an automobile?
1989.88-1353,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3443.982,3446.443,"Well, not one of the American officers."
1989.88-1353,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3446.443,3447.645,I mean one of the Mexican officers.
1989.88-1353,2,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,3447.645,3454.049,"Well, but what that points out, among other things, is the... I think the zaniness of seeking a search warrant."
1989.88-1353,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.263,3472.563,"Thank you, Mr. Robbins."
