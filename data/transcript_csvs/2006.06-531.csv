2006.06-531,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.515,"We'll next hear Case 06-531, Sole versus Wyner."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,7.356,9.868,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,44.79,72.098,"Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious to get your reaction to one of the points made by opposing counsel, which is that there were really sort of two different pieces of litigation at issue here, that it was an as-applied challenge that produced the preliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the final decision was a facial challenge."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,73.65,75.11,"No, I don't think there is."
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,105.901,123.773,What do we make of what I understand was the court's post hoc statement that what was... the reason for issuing the temporary injunction was the perception that there was a content basis at work?
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,165.869,174.164,"There's a factual answer to that and a legal answer, and I'll start with the legal answer, which is that the preliminary injunction itself states that it is assuming content--"
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,174.164,175.366,"Oh, I know that."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,176.037,177.266,--And as a legal matter--
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,177.266,180.518,"Because that's why I asked, what do we make of the court's statement subsequently?"
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,180.518,204.264,"--I think we, as the court of appeals did, have to disregard those statements because under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the preliminary injunction itself is the operative document, and the bases that it states for the issuance of the preliminary injunction are the bases that must govern both on judicial review of the injunction and as a matter of notice to the parties of the operative effect and basis for the injunction."
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,204.264,211.94,Is that so when there is some evidence in the record that a content basis actually was the criterion?
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,211.94,236.965,"And that's the factual part of my response, which is that this testimony that was relied on which we quote in full in our reply brief, was testimony by the State, a State official who did not make the decision so was not actually aware of why the decision was made, and was testimony only to the effect that the demonstration envisioned on February 14th might be different than her previous plays, because more people might be expected."
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.241,261.904,Now the 2001 order was it... was it?
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,264.216,270.01,She wrote a letter in 2000 requesting permission to perform her play--
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,270.01,270.31,--Yeah.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,270.31,273.432,--Under the same terms that she had under the stipulated settlement from 1998.
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,279.657,284.779,So the factual answer in effect is there isn't enough fact to support the distinction?
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,284.779,299.249,"And... and I guess there's in addition a legal elaboration on that factual record, which was this was all occurring in a preliminary injunction hearing that took place 24 hours before the demonstration, telephonic testimony of an ill-prepared State witness."
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,309.036,309.416,Yeah.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,322.083,326.797,The challenge continued because there was a claim for individual damages from the park manager.
2006.06-531,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,341.186,342.937,So it wasn't moot after the demonstration.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,342.937,343.457,That was not mooted out.
2006.06-531,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,343.457,344.788,That's one of the things that concerns me.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,363.002,371.436,We... the purpose of the attorney's fees provision is to encourage and reward meritorious litigation.
2006.06-531,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.859,397.874,"But in, but in many cases the case will become moot after a period of time and the Chief Justice and I have the same concern."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,404.949,411.404,There are significant consequences to a finding of liability.
2006.06-531,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,427.573,449.418,"Well, we're asking about what rule you propose we adopt and the submission to you is that if we have a rule there can never be attorneys fees in this instance, that will then create pressure to continue the litigation when it's for all practical purposes of no real importance to the parties, other than to just establish attorney's fees."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,451.558,462.766,--And but the... the situation... that situation will also obtain if you confer attorney's fees and prevailing party status on a plaintiff who only has a preliminary injunction.
2006.06-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,462.766,467.789,But do we have to judge all preliminary and judgments alike?
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,493.907,505.395,The fact that a plaintiff gets his or her way temporarily based on a preliminary junction does not mean that the defendant has violated that plaintiff's constitutional rights or that that would be the resolution of the--
2006.06-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,505.395,508.026,Who... who... where does it say you have to have done that?
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,540.139,542.15,--To prevail you must prevail on a legal claim.
2006.06-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,542.15,543.229,"Yeah, they got the legal claim."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,556.409,558.238,"Respectfully, that's not a legal claim."
2006.06-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,558.238,558.919,It is not?
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,558.919,563.473,The underlying legal claim is that the State's denial of the permit was unconstitutional.
2006.06-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,563.473,564.193,Yeah.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,568.146,571.879,That is a type of relief you are seeking but it's based on an underlying legal claim.
2006.06-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.879,575.61,"It is not a determination, is it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?"
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,575.61,576.281,It is--
2006.06-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.281,582.155,It is just a determination that we don't know at this point enough to say that you don't have a right.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,582.155,585.917,--It is a product of an equitable balancing that determines interim fairness--
2006.06-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,585.917,591.02,"Well I thought, where it say that in the statute that you have to have that particular kind of a claim?"
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,591.02,599.465,--I think this Court's cases have interpreted the word prevail and prevailing parties to mean you must prevail on the merits of a legal claim.
2006.06-531,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,613.637,626.864,"So what do you do in a situation of mootness where there's... you know, they'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that they prevail on a permanent junction as well as a preliminary one, but the case has become moot."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,632.149,635.61,A claim that is never resolved cannot be the basis of prevailing party status.
2006.06-531,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,649.24,669.182,"Well, there may be a point to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the locality governments... I mean if you ask them the question, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees where you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the case becomes moot, or would you rather have to face individual officer liability to prevent the case from becoming moot?"
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,676.716,682.271,"--Well in this case, of course, the State officials decided to defend the constitutionality of their nudity ban to the end."
2006.06-531,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,683.471,685.662,"Well, the plaintiffs decided to challenge it to the end."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,695.479,708.768,"There are significant countervailing considerations, and one is that under the rule you're proposing, state and local governments would be fearful about enforcing perfectly valid laws in emergency situations for fear of being penalized with fees."
2006.06-531,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,710.179,712.51,"Well, you are saying the Chief Justice is proposing a rule."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,740.579,749.404,"--I... I think that because of the rule I distill from this Court's case which is that you can't prevail on a claim that's not decided, it's hard for me to see what the middle ground would be."
2006.06-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,767.317,790.033,"So what do you think, when this was enacted, to make up an example that it is as horrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was riding in the South, and a group of civil rights demonstrators wanted to make certain they could have their demonstration outside the jail and they go to the judge and says the sheriff is involved in this, the whole town is; we want an injunction tomorrow."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,807.004,811.959,--And if in fact it is clear that there is no issue law in that setting.
2006.06-531,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.959,812.557,"Oh, there is."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,818.281,838.935,"Then you just articulated why that plaintiff should not be considered a prevailing party without taking the position that that is capable of repetition, but evading review situation, arguing that in effect the judgment is based totally on law and converting it essentially to a judgment on the merits, or otherwise coming to a final judgment on a claim, so that the plaintiff would have--"
2006.06-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,838.935,847.569,But why should a plaintiff do that when the plaintiff's position is we got precisely what we wanted; this is not going to be... this is a one-time only demonstration.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,865.131,881.733,"--To... to impose attorney's fees on a defendant, it's not simply about what the plaintiff gets, whether the plaintiff gets what he wants, but it is also about what the justification is for forcing the state and local government to pay fees."
2006.06-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.363,898.396,So you get a case that involves a student.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,921.46,925.664,I don't believe the student has prevailed within the meaning of Section 19(a).
2006.06-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,934.189,943.426,"But can't fight on because first, the student had gotten everything that he wanted and the case is moot."
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,945.148,950.822,"In that situation, I think the benefit is capable of repetition for debating review or of utilizing the class action--"
2006.06-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,950.822,952.693,Only if you had a class action.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,954.796,962.993,--But there are tools a plaintiff can use to prevent this kind of case from becoming moot where there is an important need to have an issue decided.
2006.06-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.993,965.464,"Apart from the class action, what... what else is there?"
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,965.464,970.938,65(a)(3) which allows consolidation of a merits determination.
2006.06-531,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,970.938,971.469,Oh.
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,972.19,973.92,I reserve the reminder of my time?
2006.06-531,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.92,976.51,"Well, I mean, what if... what if there's nothing else he can do?"
2006.06-531,0,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,995.755,1002.948,And there's no basis for awarding fees against the innocent state and local government not determined to have committed a violation.
2006.06-531,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1004.16,1005.211,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1018.138,1020.161,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.06-531,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1034.2,1036.411,Are you on the all or nothing team this morning?
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1044.376,1047.067,I won't say never in this narrow circumstance.
2006.06-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.455,1075.807,Excuse me.
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1082.88,1087.815,--Well it happened... it happened in this Court and... and... and there were dissenters.
2006.06-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.258,1114.432,"But it wasn't the issuance of the preliminary injunction that resolved it, it was the appeal to this Court where we... we resolved a question of law."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1114.432,1116.755,--This Court resolved a question of law on the merits.
2006.06-531,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1134.499,1160.015,"What is the law in respect to this, which is right on the point you're arguing, that two parties have this kind of suit and the government party... they settle it, and giving everything that the plaintiff conceivably wants, but at the end they say: We don't admit we violated the law."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1161.244,1162.456,--If it's a consent decree.
2006.06-531,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.456,1166.229,"It's a consent decree, but no admission of a violation of law."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1166.229,1167.139,"No, that's right."
2006.06-531,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1196.098,1199.679,I have never understood why that's an issue.
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1211.647,1221.444,"I think, I think that in reality certainly a party can say, I'm not entering into a consent decree if we're not going to resolve attorney's fees now or if we're going to have a fight over them."
2006.06-531,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1257.571,1261.612,"Okay, but the argument is undercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1307.934,1309.734,I have three answers to that.
2006.06-531,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1319.441,1324.413,But the only attorney's fees that would be assessed would be attorney's fees attributable to the preliminary injunction.
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1324.413,1328.857,"That's right, but they have a right not to pay anything if they haven't done anything wrong."
2006.06-531,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1328.857,1332.441,They have been found subject to a preliminary injunction.
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1334.861,1342.315,"They haven't been found to be... there may be a Presumption or a substantial likelihood they're going to lose, but that doesn't always come out."
2006.06-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.436,1349.181,"The point is you wouldn't mind putting that on a resume, that you have been subjected to a preliminary injunction."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1349.181,1350.022,--No--
2006.06-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.022,1351.973,"It's not a black mark on your name, is it?"
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1351.973,1352.333,--No.
2006.06-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.333,1355.085,You haven't violated any Federal law.
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1355.085,1356.074,This is a case in point.
2006.06-531,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1356.074,1362.608,"But it does mean, it does mean that somebody with a burden to establish an entitlement to the injunction has carried the burden."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1362.608,1366.311,"Well, the test is the prevailing party, not the substantially likely to prevail party."
2006.06-531,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1367.112,1370.434,Then let's not have it in the settlement case.
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1370.434,1374.236,"--Well, again settlements can be dealt with through the settlement, as part of the settlement process."
2006.06-531,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.546,1376.399,"They are voluntary, these settlements, aren't they?"
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1385.605,1386.424,"--Well, that's what I tried to explain to Justice Breyer."
2006.06-531,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1386.424,1388.758,"That may be, but that's not the way the statute is written."
2006.06-531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.758,1394.181,Would this case be different if the defendant had consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction?
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1394.181,1404.356,"No, I don't think so, and I don't think courts as a matter of judicial economy want to tell the government every time we agree not to oppose, to stay the removal of an alien, that we somehow would get a bill."
2006.06-531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.356,1411.05,"So if this had been, if they had entered into a consent decree covering just the one event on the front burner, that would have been different?"
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1411.05,1419.268,"A consent decree is a final resolution of a claim that legally obligates the defendant, final relief that runs in favor of the plaintiff."
2006.06-531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.268,1421.847,"But if they consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction, why wouldn't that be equally binding?"
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1421.847,1423.399,Because it is not a final resolution.
2006.06-531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.367,1448.466,"Well, they were able to go ahead with their one demonstration that precipitated the litigation, and they would have been able to do it the same way if they had a consent decree instead of having the other side not fight very vigorously in opposition to the preliminary."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1448.466,1454.488,--The defendant who'S been fully vindicated at the end of the case shouldn't have to write checks to two attorneys instead of just their own.
2006.06-531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.372,1462.005,But then why isn't the attorney... if there were a consent decree... I don't understand the difference.
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1462.005,1467.178,--Because the defendant's in the control of the fairness issue in the consent decree and is not in this situation.
2006.06-531,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1490.455,1502.642,"We have when election season comes many, many requests for injunctions, and after the election is over the case just goes away."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1504.092,1504.783,--That is not--
2006.06-531,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1504.783,1514.811,"Under your position, all of these matters must be contested until final judgment before attorney's fees are available."
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1514.811,1518.354,--That is not the United States Government's experience when it's been involved in a lot of voting cases.
2006.06-531,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1557.77,1563.123,"Ms. Millett, did I hear your legal test a while ago is an enduring change in the defendant's behavior?"
2006.06-531,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1564.355,1568.877,Enduring more in... not in the transient sense of preliminary injunction.
2006.06-531,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.047,1631.199,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1633.712,1639.406,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1649.592,1650.153,"No, no."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1653.175,1663.584,"Well, Your Honor, 20-some months later they lost on another component of their case, where they were seeking permanent relief to enjoin the facial applicability of the regulations."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1663.584,1667.466,"Their legal, their legal claim was that these regulations were invalid under the First Amendment."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1671.279,1672.932,"At the end of the case, Your Honor, yes."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1680.886,1686.9,"Well, they succeeded in filing their complaint as well, but they don't get attorney's fees for that, because they were successful at the filing complaint stage."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1686.9,1687.621,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.853,1695.334,What if they got a TRO instead of a preliminary injunction?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1695.334,1697.356,We're not suggesting that TROs--
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.356,1697.997,I know you aren't.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1698.778,1701.7,"--Well, there are structural differences between the two."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.7,1702.571,What are the two?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1707.663,1710.646,There was not the adversariness that exists in a preliminary injunction.
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1712.346,1713.498,But it's just prevails.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1725.506,1727.639,--We're not suggesting that as the basic rule.
2006.06-531,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1741.458,1747.882,What if you get a preliminary injunction and then at the permanent injunction stage the basis for the preliminary injunction is reversed.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1759.95,1761.53,--Then we would not be prevailing.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1764.381,1766.624,Even though you got what you wanted?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1809.832,1811.214,That's correct.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1841.224,1857.055,"I thought this court said, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you wanted to put on a demonstration that would be like the plays, that would be hidden from public view because you have a curtain or whatever around it."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1874.346,1876.199,--That is what was at the end.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.588,1922.431,Let's stay with this case because your interest is in getting fees in this case.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1933.037,1935.048,--We would obviously be a prevailing party.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1935.839,1938.41,Even though you lost on the preliminary injunction?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1938.41,1938.791,--Yes.
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1943.636,1948.969,"But you would get attorney's fees for the preliminary injunction work, even though you lost on that?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1948.969,1952.822,We would get attorney's fees for the reasonable work that ended up leading to the success.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1958.566,1967.511,"That parsing, is there any doubt that if you won on the main, in the main bout, that you would get your fees for your entire representation?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1967.511,1969.292,"Yes, there is doubt, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1972.975,1974.928,Not that.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,1993.989,1998.974,"Well, Your Honor, under Hensley you look to see whether they're related or unrelated claims."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1999.732,2001.024,They're obviously related.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2028.613,2035.095,--We would hope a court would find that an as-applied challenge and a facial challenge were sufficiently related that we'd be entitled to fees for both.
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.537,2040.2,Even though you lost on the preliminary injunction?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2048.626,2050.025,--If I had won the final--
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.025,2050.806,Yes or no?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2052.299,2053.148,--Yes.
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.148,2053.969,Okay.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2053.969,2062.014,"But I would like to caution that that would be eligible for fees, but the court would go through it and say how much of this were related to your final win, was it reasonable."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.014,2062.274,No.
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2068.358,2076.715,"All the work you did to show irreparable harm, balance of the equities, not on the merits, you're saying that's off the table?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2076.715,2081.748,"Well, it... no, Your Honor, because those very things are also needed at a permanent injunction."
2006.06-531,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2081.748,2087.802,But you've got five hours billed... you bill for five hours to write the brief that you submit at the preliminary injunction stage.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2092.717,2093.666,Probably.
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2102.561,2120.624,"Counsel, your approach, just as there are problems from the judicial economy perspective with your friend's approach, but doesn't your approach require the States to fight tooth and nail on the preliminary injunction because they're running the risk if they lose there, they're going to pay fees even if they prevail later?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2133.773,2134.913,"Well, two things, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.223,2151.865,"I don't know what you mean, if the decision on what?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2153.365,2153.896,--Yes.
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.896,2155.866,Is repudiated by the district... how is it repudiated?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2157.669,2166.595,"Well, in the hypothetical where the same facts, the same law, and the district court says I was wrong, that would be the kind of repudiation."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.595,2167.925,"In a later case, you mean?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2167.925,2170.927,"In the course of the proceedings in the same case, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.818,2173.689,"Well, he doesn't have to say he's wrong."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2196.645,2198.175,"--No, Your Honor, it's not."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2204.7,2222.732,"Where... can you... I thought what he said was... I thought they wanted a demonstration that was going to be secure from public view, and instead I understand now that's not... that wasn't what they wanted from the start."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2247.256,2253.12,--I don't believe that that's the fairest reading of the district court's subsequent orders in this case.
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.548,2268.56,"Yes, but assume the district court thought he was right at the preliminary injunction, and ruled otherwise at the permanent junction."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2275.306,2281.951,"--Well, Your Honor, we would suggest that the person in the best position to understand what the district court was doing--"
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.951,2282.529,Is the district court.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2282.529,2283.14,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.14,2287.464,But maybe the court of appeals is in the best position to determine whether they made an error of law or not.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2287.464,2287.945,Yes.
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.077,2293.388,"And if they think he made an error of law, what should they do?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2293.388,2301.223,"--If he had made an error of law in the preliminary injunction ruling that, on de novo review, and reversed, then--"
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.223,2302.785,"No, there's no reverse."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2320.916,2327.05,"--We would suggest the latter, Your Honor, in part to avoid the fees on fees litigation problems."
2006.06-531,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2329.882,2332.554,"In other words, to avoid fees on fees, we do something that's wrong?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2332.554,2333.455,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.796,2341.148,I thought that it... am I wrong about that?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2363.993,2365.706,"--It is the law, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.535,2384.695,"I thought the hypothetical was different, was, the case proceeds to final judgment on the merits; and at that point... okay... at that point, the issue of whether the preliminary injunction was valid or not comes up, not in the direct appeal from the preliminary injunction."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2384.695,2386.547,--I--
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.547,2388.228,Assume you win on the merits.
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.228,2390.03,It's a direct appeal on the fee issue.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2390.03,2390.919,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2423.591,2426.132,Is there any authority for that?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2449.89,2454.562,"--Well, I mean, the courts of appeals have adopted different standards."
2006.06-531,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.702,2460.355,Is there any case you can think of that under those circumstances let's him have the attorney's fees?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2460.355,2461.625,--I can't point to one.
2006.06-531,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.625,2462.616,"No, I would be surprised."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2462.616,2462.927,But the--
2006.06-531,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2462.927,2466.96,"The other thing that I wonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2531.653,2533.243,--They did get what they wanted.
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2564.274,2566.636,Did the court order provide for a screen?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2566.636,2568.695,The court order that... no.
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.685,2582.925,That included a screen.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2582.925,2585.797,"It did, Your Honor, but it didn't order the screen."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.797,2586.868,But your people didn't want a screen.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2586.868,2587.99,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2587.99,2589.61,So they didn't get what they asked for.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2589.61,2597.304,"They didn't get removed from the beach or arrested for being nude either, Your Honor, so they did get what they wanted."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.304,2608.854,"Well, that's only because, I guess the other side didn't take the action that they could have taken if they didn't... if they didn't apply the screen."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2608.854,2618.29,"Your Honor, when you obtain the court award, just as if you obtain a court award to get on a ballot or to hold a parade, or to wear a tee shirt, I mean, you get that--"
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2618.29,2620.761,Did they conduct the demonstration with a screen or without a screen?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2620.761,2621.39,--I'm sorry?
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.39,2624.713,Did they conduct the demonstration with or without a screen?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2624.713,2626.763,They did not use the screen.
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2626.763,2632.85,"And since they didn't use the screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting them; is that correct?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2632.85,2634.069,That's correct.
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.069,2636.48,So they did not get what they asked for.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2647.666,2657.844,"They didn't get that, but they got something more than they had when they went in, which was, they got the right to be naked on the beach, which would have otherwise subjected them to arrest."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.776,2661.017,The state had no problem with that.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2664.809,2667.441,--It wouldn't let them do that this time even with the screen.
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2673.204,2675.725,So the State prevailed to some extent as well.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2680.637,2682.58,--They... yes.
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2683.79,2696.099,"So they're entitled to some... I mean, if... this is not a reciprocal switching thing, but I mean, it does go to the question of whether or not you are the prevailing party when your opponents have prevailed to a significant extent as well."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2696.099,2710.788,"--With respect, even if we had sought and obtained a permanent injunction that allowed us to protest but not behind the screen, we'd be a prevailing party, although the defendants by their successful advocacy would have narrowed the scope of the injunction."
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.788,2711.459,Let me ask you this.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2721.735,2724.586,"Yes, Your Honor, that was an underlying part of that."
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.586,2728.73,"And what is the support in our cases for that proposition, if any?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2728.73,2737.917,"Well, I think this Court's cases in Barnes, the nude dancing cases suggest that expressive activity combined with nudity is protected by the First Amendment."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2755.657,2766.384,But that was also a... that was the demonstration or the show arrangement under the... was it the Brooklyn Bridge or the Williamsburg Bridge?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2766.384,2769.396,"--It was on the streets of New York, Your Honor, yes."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2769.396,2770.948,At 6 a.m.--
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2770.948,2772.087,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.568,2795.943,"But see, it's so extraordinary for somebody to make the other side pay for his attorney."
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.072,2860.655,"It's not just a question of what we require, but what Congress intended when they wrote a statute authorizing these fees."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.655,2866.031,I assume that Congress doesn't often do things that are grossly unfair.
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.112,2874.555,And these trump the literal language very definitely.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2874.555,2888.145,"Speaking of the language, we have here when Congress enacted 1970... 1998... in 1976, just two years before this Court had interpreted another civil rights attorney's fees statute."
2006.06-531,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2894.159,2898.52,"Well, before you leave that, I wonder if... there's one other thing floating around in my mind."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2938.199,2945.015,"I think, Your Honor, that... well, first of all, the preliminary injunction itself was an equitable remedy."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2960.163,2967.249,"You can't go into court with the objective of just getting preliminary relief, can you?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2974.034,2976.104,"That's true, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2978.455,2978.776,Knowing that--
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2978.776,2980.917,--you're only going to be getting--
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2980.917,2981.918,--preliminary injunction.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2981.918,2983.521,--And everyone here... excuse me.
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2989.254,2992.307,"On the February 14th, but your client sought further relief."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,2992.307,2993.028,--Yes.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2998.852,3000.093,--You get costs?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3011.777,3013.279,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3018.983,3020.423,So you would split the costs?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3020.423,3023.755,--He found we were both prevailing parties in the case.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3040.148,3052.015,"So this defendant, having succeeded in being the winner in the whole case, didn't get costs for the whole case; is that what you're telling me?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3052.015,3061.182,"They were awarded... they sought and were awarded all their costs for the entire case, or they sought their costs for the entire case."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3069.177,3072.659,So they were entitled to costs for the entire case?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3072.659,3073.759,"Yes, they were, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3073.759,3079.693,And attorney's fees under the statute are to be awarded as part of costs?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3079.693,3080.544,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3080.544,3093.402,"So if you're not entitled to costs, if the defendant got the full costs, then how do you get entitled to attorney's fees when the statute puts them together?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3096.895,3097.604,That's correct.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3104.659,3105.27,But this wasn't--
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3105.27,3106.382,No.
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3106.382,3113.948,--This was one that the state got all of its costs from your client?
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3113.948,3114.406,Yes.
2006.06-531,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3152.931,3159.086,"What if that's not the case, but the plaintiff after getting a preliminary injunction just voluntarily dismisses the case?"
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3162.448,3167.53,"Oh, I think the answer is yes."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.901,3198.061,I know you were asked this question and your answer may have just slipped by me.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3202.225,3219.607,"We think that Congress's distinction as far as putting preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions in one category and TROs in another for purposes of appealability, reflect kind of a congressional judgment about which is... which mechanism is intended to alter the kind of substantial rights."
2006.06-531,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3233.775,3239.438,"Because the TRO case, characteristically the other side isn't heard, so you haven't prevailed."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3239.438,3242.89,"That is one way to view it, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3248.414,3248.875,No.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3254.94,3259.043,"--Well, this Court has certainly described some relief as the threshold of prevailing."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.874,3284.969,"--Well, you surely wouldn't say that the fact that the other side never shows up means that you can't get your attorney's fees."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3284.969,3285.58,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3286.16,3290.073,So you're a prevailing party whether there's an adversary on the other side or not.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3290.073,3297.409,"--What I'm saying is that the TRO anticipates that, which is in part why we're not suggesting TROs are--"
2006.06-531,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.409,3297.83,Yes.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3304.663,3308.996,"--Yes, Your Honor, but we were... we did have a preliminary injunction."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3313.498,3319.412,"The State did make a point, that they were kind of... this was short notice and they were doing the best they could on short notice."
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3322.234,3324.027,"--With three attorneys, Your Honor."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.665,3342.088,But the regulations told you weren't allowed to protest nude.
2006.06-531,2,41355,seth_m_galanter,,3342.088,3348.443,"Your Honor, those same regulations had been in effect the four previous times she had protested nude."
2006.06-531,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3439.553,3440.801,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-531,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3443.325,3447.256,"Ms. Seitz, would you clarify that point about costs?"
2006.06-531,3,43676,virginia_a_seitz,,3452.96,3458.265,The plaintiffs were awarded costs incurred on the preliminary injunction.
2006.06-531,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3563.444,3564.416,"Thank you, counsel."
