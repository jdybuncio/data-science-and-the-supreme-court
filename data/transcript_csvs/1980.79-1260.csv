1980.79-1260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.949,We will hear arguments first this morning in the case of Chandler and Granger v. Florida.
1980.79-1260,0,30965,joel_hirschhorn,,13.824,19.431,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1489.076,1491.591,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.278,1538.102,"Mr. Fox, before you get through will you explain to me why the Estes decision is not squarely in point in this case?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1538.102,1541.585,"The Estes opinion, Your Honor, as I am sure you are well aware--"
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.585,1550.082,I'm talking about the holding in that case based specifically on the one question the Court granted certiorari to consider.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1550.082,1557.08,"--It is a plurality opinion in which only four members of the Court joined in a rule, per se rule against judgment of the Court, however, reversing--"
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.08,1560.515,I'm talking about the judgment of the Court on the facts of the case.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1564.67,1566.387,"--It is a stronger case, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.839,1570.745,A stronger case for allowing the television.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1570.745,1573.011,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.011,1577.087,"I said, it's a stronger case for allowing television because the jury was sequestered."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1577.087,1582.694,But on the other hand the extreme fact circumstances in that case--
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.694,1584.584,There were no extreme fact circumstances.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1598.171,1603.7,"--Well, Mr. Justice... well, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stevens, the court focused upon pre-trial hearings."
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.794,1609.542,"I asked you, why wasn't the holding specifically in point here?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1609.542,1613.9,"--It is not specifically on point, Your Honor, because of the fact circumstance there."
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.196,1616.665,In what respect?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1620.288,1623.272,"--The facts in that case, the--"
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.272,1626.63,"I'm talking about the trial, too; not the pre-trial hearing."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1626.63,1633.719,"--Your Honor, I would submit to you that the trial was a separate and distinctly serene proceeding."
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.998,1643.137,"It was selected portions here too, though."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1643.137,1645.559,"Yes, you're certainly correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.04,1656.243,The court declined to grant certiorari on that very question.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1659.163,1671.892,"--But, Your Honor, a reading of the Clark opinion, a reading of the Warren, Douglas, and Goldberg opinions, they concentrate entirely upon the pre-trial hearings, and the infection which preceded the trial."
1980.79-1260,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1678.077,1692.898,"That's all that was actually an issue in the Court's judgment, and the Court, as a Court, not a plurality but a Court, five people reversed the conviction in the case because of the presence of television at the trial, per se."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1692.898,1694.945,"--Your Honor, the--"
1980.79-1260,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1694.945,1698.912,So why isn't my brother Stevens exactly correct in his question?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1698.912,1709.221,"--Most respectfully, by your leave, Mr. Justice Stewart, I'd submit to you that Mr. Justice Harlan would not have joined in a per se rule, and in fact he did not."
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.777,1729.696,"The fact that he relied on was the fact that it was a notorious case, not a run-of-the-mill case, and this was sufficiently notorious so that it justified 2-1/2 minutes on the evening news."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1734.257,1738.755,"--Yes, Your Honor, that becomes a question, then."
1980.79-1260,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1743.221,1746.05,"Well, do the Florida rules apply to all trials?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1746.05,1748.408,"Yes, Your Honor, it certainly does."
1980.79-1260,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.298,1751.641,Would it apply to a drunken driving case?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1751.641,1752.015,--Pardon me?
1980.79-1260,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1752.015,1755.248,Would it apply to a drunken driving case?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1755.248,1755.826,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1756.92,1758.965,And would it apply to a misdemeanor case?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1758.965,1760.152,"Yes, Your Honor, any trial."
1980.79-1260,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1760.949,1762.62,It would apply to a spitting-on-the-sidewalk case?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1762.62,1763.978,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1980.79-1260,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.978,1765.79,Or to an Estes case?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1765.79,1769.196,"Or to an Estes case, or to a Zamora case."
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.196,1780.582,"The Estes case was a case involving a lot of financial records, if I remember the opinion, whereas this is a case involving a couple of police officers who allegedly robbed a popular restaurant."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1780.582,1787.875,"Yes, Your Honor, and I submit that three minutes on the evening news does not compare to the eleven volumes of publicity in the trial of the Estes case."
1980.79-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.875,1791.89,"On the pre-trial publicity point that's certainly true, but that was not what was decided."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1802.354,1811.866,"Yes, Your Honor, as the Wisconsin brief notes, television cameras have been at zoning appeals, at traffic appeals, at any sort of civil proceedings--"
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.866,1816.771,The action to quiet title that I hypothesized.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1823.254,1831.407,"--Your Honor, I would submit to you that it is possible that a circumstance could arise where a quiet title case could be publicized."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.407,1835.279,"Oh, I suppose... I'm talking about the typical action to quiet title."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1843.338,1845.9,"Yes, that was the case I had in mind, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.9,1851.116,"But to quiet title on an ordinary residence, would television be interested in it?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1851.116,1855.943,"Your Honor, that's a question of editorial policy which I think this Court has not intruded into."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1877.073,1882.962,Let me ask you this hypothetical question since we have no empirical evidence in the record.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1895.145,1896.567,"In Estes, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.567,1897.957,"No, this case."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1897.957,1905.126,"No, this case was a brief segment of the jury selection and a brief segment of the State's key witness."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1905.126,1910.405,"Now, that's all the television viewers saw, was the witness?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1910.405,1910.858,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.858,1925.305,"Suppose that they then followed a recent example and said, call 993-1234 if you think this fellow is guilty, no toll charge."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1938.222,1950.764,"Yes, Your Honor, I think the Florida Supreme Court has clearly in the final paragraph of its opinion left a warning to the media that any abuses by the media would result in a rescission of the rule."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1951.873,1957.666,"If they abuse the First Amendment, the Supreme Court's going to go after them?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1957.666,1958.432,"--No, Your Honor--"
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.432,1959.588,Is that the way you read that rule?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1959.588,1960.024,--Pardon me?
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.024,1961.665,Is that the way you read that rule?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,1961.665,1971.848,"Your Honor, in the final paragraph of the opinion, the Court says that the past abuses of the press are in the past, and we believe that."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.899,2013.581,"What would be your view, if you care to express it, on whether that would be an abuse of the rules, the hypothetical I gave you, to take this instant ballot having heard only the prosecution's evidence?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2013.581,2018.58,"The basis in the rule for the rescission, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2018.58,2022.75,Could the Court have found them in contempt for doing that?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2022.75,2031.17,I think the judicial control which has been left in the Florida trial courts by the rule.
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.54,2042.368,Could they?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2051.927,2057.098,I think it's a very close question.
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2091.052,2093.332,"Mr. Fox, may I ask this question?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2104.297,2106.812,"Yes, Your Honor, he certainly does."
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2106.812,2108.671,Have they done so since the rule was adopted?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2108.671,2111.856,"Yes, Your Honor, they certainly have."
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2111.856,2115.917,What considerations impel a court to make that ruling?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2115.917,2131.177,"Well, the rule itself states quite clearly the grounds relating to the difference in the effect upon the witness as opposed to the general public, and the difference relating to the type of media coverage."
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2136.987,2143.969,"I would distinguish, of course, the printed press media."
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2155.231,2155.887,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2167.211,2168.133,Why was it done in that case?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2168.133,2177.988,--In that case a prisoner had objected to being filmed because of the fact that he felt his life would be in jeopardy if he testified.
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2216.692,2234.325,"Have you had a case yet where a witness after being sworn but before taking the stand simply said to the judge, I've been camera-shy all my life, I just don't think I can possibly testify fairly and honestly with cameras on me?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2234.325,2252.536,"We have a case involving a defendant, Green v. State, cited in our brief, where the defendant stated a long winding motion about her background and her social upbringing and so forth, and she stated that she was bothered with conferring with her counsel."
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2263.187,2271.043,"You are saying, as I understand it, that the judge has full discretion to exclude cameras from the courtroom?"
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2271.043,2271.653,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2271.653,2277.744,If a witness or a juror persuaded him that it was in the best interests of justice?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2277.744,2278.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2280.962,2282.102,Suppose you had a camera-shy lawyer?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2282.102,2298.112,"Well, Your Honor, that relates to another issue, I think, an issue which this Court has occasionally had a chance to address, Mr. Chief Justice, involving the quality of representation, the quality of trial court judges, and so forth."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2321.539,2331.505,I understood Mr. Justice Powell to be probing at the idea that even a competent lawyer might be less competent if he was allergic to cameras?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2331.505,2332.551,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.551,2335.768,And therefore his performance might be negatively affected.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2335.768,2338.517,That's correct.
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.517,2339.33,What do you have to say about that?
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2339.33,2356.137,"I would submit to you, the man, as the Colorado Supreme Court said in 1956, an attorney who is a strutter, an attorney who is a show-off an attorney who's incompetent, is going to be incompetent, a show-off or a strutter, whether the cameras are there or not."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2356.137,2361.478,But that doesn't answer the question I put and that I thought Mr. Justice Powell was probing at.
1980.79-1260,1,18905,calvin_l_fox,,2375.737,2385.609,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd submit to you that that is precisely what we've argued in our brief."
1980.79-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2412.458,2416.144,Mr. Attorney General.
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2416.144,2419.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.012,2498.064,"Mr. Smith, do you suppose this Court would give very serious consideration to the claim of a lawyer who said he was used to practicing in a courtroom that only seated 20 people, and was now trying a case that seated 300 people, that he just wasn't used to practicing before a large crowd and therefore all but 20 should be excluded?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2498.064,2503.734,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I really don't think that that issue would ever be heard by this Court."
1980.79-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.167,2521.509,What if it was Yankee Stadium or the Gary Powers' trial?
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2521.509,2529.491,This Court would not accommodate--
1980.79-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.491,2531.443,You wouldn't have to ask them to try it first in Yankee Stadium?
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2531.443,2531.99,"--No, sir."
1980.79-1260,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2534.082,2537.987,"That's about the only way you can get a public trial in New York, isn't it?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2537.987,2539.75,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1260,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.75,2547.499,"That's about the only way you could get a ""public"" trial in New York, would be a building twice the size of Yankee Stadium."
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2552.497,2562.04,The courtroom size will accommodate the number of people that the particular courtroom designated can take.
1980.79-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.04,2563.712,In other words it can't apply to television.
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2565.57,2585.78,"Certainly, and the presence of the media in the courtroom and your recent judgment in the Richmond case recognized the surrogate responsibility that the media has and the function that they perform in bringing to the attention of the public any kind of trial that is newsworthy."
1980.79-1260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.78,2595.292,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, I understand the argument that the televising has an educational, public good to it."
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2606.102,2625.405,"The experience that we have had to date in Florida, and we have certainly had our share of highly sensational publicized trials, has been that the presence of cameras in the courtroom has indeed improved that process."
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.97,2670.137,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, unless Estes is overturned, wouldn't your rule be invalid in a rather large category of cases?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2670.137,2673.996,--Mr. Justice White--
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.996,2674.822,Such as the Zamora case?
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2674.822,2685.444,--We don't think that it's necessary to overturn the Estes opinion to uphold the Florida Supreme Court rule.
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.444,2688.787,Why?
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2688.787,2696.392,The Estes opinion did not say that television cameras per se were a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights.
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.392,2704.794,"I know, but I just asked you about the category of trial such as Justice Harlan described in his opinion in that case."
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2712.885,2713.307,I would not--
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.307,2725.553,"Now, in that category of trial, wouldn't your rule be invalid in at least some cases under Estes?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2725.553,2727.209,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.61,2740.811,"That isn't Justice Harlan's holding, is it?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2751.353,2761.756,--Justice Harlan said that obviously he was not willing to go along with the four other justices and on a per se basis deny states the right.
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.756,2771.597,"He said, however, in the notorious trial there was a per se rule without the necessity of demonstrating any particular prejudice."
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2771.597,2779.452,"My reading of that opinion is he said, a sensational trial in 1962 under the facts in the Estes case."
1980.79-1260,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2779.452,2781.404,"Well, isn't that almost self-defining?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2794.009,2813.734,"No, Your Honor, the experience in Florida is that every news station in our state has a courthouse beat and it is common in the TV news programs and in the newspapers in Florida that what is going on at the courthouse is reported."
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.734,2817.639,What about the Zamora case?
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2817.639,2819.139,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.139,2830.057,Do you think Justice Harlan would have thought that the Zamora case fell within his definition of a notorious trial?
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2830.057,2854.25,"I do not, Your Honor, and I would like... Judge Baker, who was the trial judge in that case, at the request of the Florida Supreme Court made a very detailed report of that proceeding, which was conducted during the experiment period of the Florida rule, and distinguished what took place at that trial from the Estes opinion."
1980.79-1260,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2864.964,2868.416,"Mr. Attorney General, let me get back to a point."
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2876.255,2880.661,"No, sir, I did not mean to imply that the media covers every trial."
1980.79-1260,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2899.356,2901.684,"Well, it obviously can't be."
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2901.684,2902.933,Absolutely.
1980.79-1260,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2904.074,2922.986,"Are you telling us, Mr. Attorney General, that broadcasting two minutes and 52 seconds, was it, or 55 seconds of the prosecution's case only, just one side of the case, has contributed something significant to the improvement of the administration of justice in Florida?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2922.986,2936.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, in particularly a sensational type trial, the media will cover that event, it will be reported on television--"
1980.79-1260,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2936.935,2940.761,"I'm just talking about television now, in broadcasting the live action, not the--"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,2940.761,2961.486,"--I submit that it is better for the citizens of our state in those situations to see the actual image and hear those portions of the testimony as it has happened, rather that have to depend on the interpretation that a news commentator might like to give it."
1980.79-1260,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2961.486,2998.144,"--Is there any possibility, significant possibility, that the listening audience having watched two minutes and 55 seconds of the prosecution's case only, and later the jury finds the defendants in a particular case not guilty, that the jurors will be subject to criticism of their neighbors and their friends and their associates for a verdict of not guilty, when they have seen evidence only of guilt?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,3001.049,3010.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, that certainly is a possibility, but that possibility exists and does happen whether cameras are present in the courtroom or not."
1980.79-1260,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3010.936,3016.873,"In any event, Mr. Attorney General, we don't need to, and we mustn't, decide whether or not this is a good idea."
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,3020.151,3020.964,That's correct.
1980.79-1260,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3025.15,3041.236,"But the question of whether it has a deleterious effect on the administration of justice as a rule, is part of the total question before this Court, not whether it's a good idea for the television stations."
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,3041.236,3042.377,--That's certainly--
1980.79-1260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3042.377,3056.123,"Is there any provision in the Constitution that forbids a state from adopting a procedure that has a deleterious effect on the administration of justice, in haec verba?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,3064.478,3066.273,--He did.
1980.79-1260,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3276.783,3286.764,"Mr. Attorney General, is there anything in the record to the effect one way or the other that when television is present a larger venire is needed?"
1980.79-1260,2,33124,jim_smith,,3286.764,3293.902,"That has not... there's nothing in the record that indicates that, Your Honor."
1980.79-1260,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3335.854,3337.073,"Very well, Mr. Attorney General."
1980.79-1260,3,30965,joel_hirschhorn,,3339.775,3344.819,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1260,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.91,3440.113,"Well, that's no part of the Constitution."
1980.79-1260,3,30965,joel_hirschhorn,,3440.113,3441.909,Just its history.
1980.79-1260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3468.304,3472.272,I don't imagine the ratings would have been too good on that show.
1980.79-1260,3,30965,joel_hirschhorn,,3498.636,3499.901,Not necessarily.
1980.79-1260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3523.437,3525.641,But does the jury know which part is being televised?
1980.79-1260,3,30965,joel_hirschhorn,,3525.641,3526.0,"--Oh, yes."
1980.79-1260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3526.748,3529.825,"Because, as I understand it, there's no red light anymore."
1980.79-1260,3,30965,joel_hirschhorn,,3529.825,3534.122,--The problem is... and I now understand the question... the camera wasn't present the whole time.
1980.79-1260,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.058,3536.261,"Oh, I see."
1980.79-1260,3,30965,joel_hirschhorn,,3538.666,3539.15,I'm sorry.
1980.79-1260,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3673.864,3681.063,Is that the way you distinguish the written word from the television picture?
1980.79-1260,3,30965,joel_hirschhorn,,3681.063,3681.985,"No, I distinguish it--"
1980.79-1260,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3681.985,3684.406,That it was in effect at the time the Constitution was written?
1980.79-1260,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3703.54,3705.366,"Thank you, gentlemen the case is submitted."
