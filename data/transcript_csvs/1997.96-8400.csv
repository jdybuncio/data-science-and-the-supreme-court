1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.857,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-8400, Douglas McArthur Buchanan v. Ronald J. Angelone."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,59.54,62.571,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.254,105.29,"Mr. Zerkin, is the instruction given here typical of the instruction that is routinely given in Virginia in these capital cases, or is it different?"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,105.29,108.863,"Justice O'Connor, it is... it was somewhat typical."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.21,164.849,What is the specific test that you say we must employ in determining whether these instructions necessitate overturning--
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,164.849,166.93,Your Honor--
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.93,167.932,--the sentence or the trial?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,167.932,168.202,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.177,180.549,"Well, but what's the test that we employ?"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,197.949,199.131,"--Your Honor, that is--"
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.131,199.721,Is that right?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,199.721,202.433,"--Well, I don't think that that's the test that applies here--"
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.433,202.824,Why?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,202.824,206.147,--because there's no instruction at all on the issue of mitigation.
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.087,209.647,Applied the instructions--
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,209.647,211.519,--The Court--
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.519,217.083,--in the case in such a way that they were prevented from considering constitutionally relevant evidence.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,219.074,219.725,--The Court has--
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.725,220.146,Right or wrong?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,220.146,241.77,"--In other contexts, right, and the reason I say other contexts, and it's critical here, or it's significant here, I think in fact we pass that test as well, and I will discuss that, but that arises in cases such as Boyde v. California, in which the question is whether or not the instructions are expansive enough to allow for consideration of all of the mitigating evidence."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.603,287.459,"Well, the judge says to the jury, you are to consider all of the evidence that comes in at trial."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,287.459,288.19,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.19,294.614,And certainly there was evidence that came in of a mitigating nature.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,295.974,296.164,Yes.
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,296.164,298.596,"And the judge says, consider everything here."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,298.596,309.704,"But then what he says is, your decision is, impose life if you find from this consideration of all the evidence that death is not justified."
1997.96-8400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,315.238,315.618,All right.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,337.442,344.648,--Our position would be that that probably would pass muster and obviously even that wasn't done here.
1997.96-8400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,366.765,372.519,"But we're talking about the constitutional minimum, not the model charge, which I take it is a considerable improvement."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,389.849,392.761,"On one level, Your Honor, yes, and not on the other level."
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.646,418.15,I thought the jury had to be able to consider any mitigating factors.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,430.745,433.687,"It was not a problem here, Your Honor, nor is it theoretically."
1997.96-8400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.522,459.884,"But Mr. Zerkin, I think you answered my question, yes, it would have been enough."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,473.815,477.466,"Well, I have... Justice Ginsburg, I have two positions on that."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.807,495.518,"Well, you're giving very confusing answers."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,507.335,508.216,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.216,509.408,Suppose the judge had done that.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,509.408,512.57,"If he did not include the catch all it would be a Lockett violation, clearly."
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.57,517.052,And are you saying that he had to read the list from the statute of the mitigating evidence?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,517.052,520.865,"The ones that were supported by the evidence, it's our position that he did have to do that."
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,520.865,532.483,"But now, the only... the only objection that you preserved, as I understand it, was that you requested the judge to charge that in several instances a particular kind of evidence was mitigating evidence."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,533.302,534.093,No--
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.093,537.035,You didn't ask for a definition of mitigation.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,537.035,546.862,"--At every stage of the proceedings, from the trial on, counsel for Mr. Buchanan has argued that they were entitled to... that he was entitled to--"
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.862,550.695,Are you... I'm talking to you about what instructions you requested.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,556.158,558.329,"--No, I think I'm answering the question, Judge."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,595.422,610.993,"Well, but if the test is as I articulated it, is there a reasonable likelihood that the jury was prevented from considering the evidence, the answer to that may be no, because the judge said you will consider all the evidence."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,634.398,639.691,"Yes, Your Honor, because the trial attorney, the... excuse me."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,646.937,655.063,"Well, judges always say that, but this Court also in other cases has looked to the whole picture and what was argued to the jury."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,655.063,655.333,--But--
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,655.333,662.118,"And there is no question, is there, that both the prosecutor and the defense counsel told the jury, yes, you're going to consider these--"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,662.118,674.385,"--Well, actually there was some conflicting argument, because the prosecutor at one point said, you may sentence based upon your own caprice, and he told the jury that they can... that you may... you're entitled to consider this."
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.497,678.406,"--Well, let's just take the judge's instructions."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,698.372,698.84,2 days--
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.84,705.024,"--in this trial about his abused youth, and about his psychological problems."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,705.685,706.236,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.236,709.298,What do you think the jury thought this evidence was coming in for?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,709.298,710.688,"Well, we don't... we don't know what--"
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.688,722.796,"Any jury that had sat through 2 days of mitigating testimony about, you know, the terrible childhood and so forth, and then gets this instruction, if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified--"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,722.796,723.016,--But--
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.016,724.859,"--My goodness, you really think there's--"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,724.859,733.715,"--Yes, because the jury can look at this instruction and it can say, the question is whether it's justified or not, and there are four victims in this case, and that's what it's about."
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.204,740.048,--But the jury in its form of verdict said that it had considered the mitigating evidence.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,740.048,742.631,"Well, but we don't know when that was even looked at, and the--"
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,742.631,743.06,Well--
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,743.06,745.253,"--The practical... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.253,750.906,"--Well, you know, we don't really know what the verdict of the jury was except from this same certificate."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,750.906,761.351,"The practical difficulty, the reality of trying cases, is that juries make decisions based upon what the... primarily what the judge instruction of the law is."
1997.96-8400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,795.953,797.415,"Did any juror, other than the foreman--"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,804.401,804.761,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.516,820.811,"Well, but the foreman is saying that they considered mitigating evidence, just as the foreman is saying they voted unanimously."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,820.811,835.921,"--That is correct, and we have absolutely... because nothing was given to the jury about what mitigation was, or what it meant, or how it was supposed to be used, there was no context for it at all, we have no idea what role that played in the deliberative process."
1997.96-8400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,835.921,837.791,"Well, can we not consider this."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,916.023,922.188,"Not where the instruction is completely devoid, as in this case, of any reference to mitigation."
1997.96-8400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,922.188,925.4,"It's the missing word, or the missing four words."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,925.4,931.695,"Or the missing concept, and however it does it, that concept must be given the imprimatur of the presiding judge."
1997.96-8400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,931.695,932.884,But it's got to be expressed.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,932.884,933.174,Yes.
1997.96-8400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,945.322,946.972,"Yes, but this is more than information."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,965.335,971.56,"--I disagree with the premise that the jury instruction allows for that, and that's because of the use of the word justification."
1997.96-8400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,978.465,988.492,"Based on all the evidence, and all of the evidence is not merely, as you pointed out, the number of victims, but the evidence of mitigation which consumed several days of trial."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,988.492,1001.81,"--To do that the Court has to abandon what I think has been its principle throughout the course of its Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, that we must provide careful guidance as to both aggravation and mitigation."
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.151,1020.262,What about Franklin?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1020.262,1020.593,--you can go out and do it.
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.593,1021.442,What about Franklin?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1033.04,1035.582,There has to be both.
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.445,1043.347,Furman wasn't even a Court opinion.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1043.347,1047.29,"--But the theories all stem from Furman, and it goes to Gregg."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1047.29,1050.422,The Court in a case... I don't even know how to pronounce it.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1051.444,1051.704,Tuilaepa.
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1052.515,1061.652,Hard to pronounce... said that States need not instruct juries as to how to weigh any particular fact in a capital sentencing decision.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1061.652,1063.061,We're not talking about--
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1063.061,1063.572,They don't have to do that.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1063.572,1064.744,--We're not talking about weighing.
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.568,1073.569,What about Franklin?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1073.569,1079.042,The... I don't... I don't see Franklin as affecting the equation.
1997.96-8400,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.042,1116.015,"Well Franklin, as I read it, I... you've probably read it more carefully and more recently, but I thought that they upheld a Texas instruction that never mentioned the word mitigation, that the Court rejected the need to have an instruction that told them about, you have to consider evidence that mitigates, that all the judge said in Franklin, the only relevant thing, was he read number 2... you know, that second part of the Texas thing that says, the jury must, to sentence a person to death, have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability he will commit future crimes, and that was it."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1121.338,1123.431,"That's correct, but remember that you're dealing--"
1997.96-8400,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.431,1123.732,Why doesn't that--
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1123.732,1134.398,"--You're dealing with the uniqueness of the Texas statutory scheme, and the standard the court has set up for the Texas scheme is that there must be a vehicle for giving effect to the mitigating evidence."
1997.96-8400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1210.176,1215.65,"--Mr. Zerkin, the counsel discussed mitigation at length, both defense counsel and the prosecutor."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1223.927,1225.548,--He--
1997.96-8400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1225.548,1229.151,"Sometimes a judge will say, you take the law from me and not from the counsel."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1229.151,1230.102,--Now... yeah.
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1250.244,1252.826,What did he say about the role of counsel?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1261.692,1263.502,I don't believe--
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.502,1264.854,That's a typical instruction.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1264.854,1266.975,--He did not... he did not instruct them on that.
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1266.975,1270.999,I don't find all of these instructions in the appendix filed here.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1276.641,1280.832,"Your Honor, the... what I just read to you comes from page 1573 of the transcript."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1282.935,1284.054,So we have to go to the transcript rather than the--
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1284.054,1285.857,For that particular--
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1285.857,1288.469,--appendix for these other instructions.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1288.469,1291.361,"--For that particular statement, it is not in the joint appendix, that is correct."
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.361,1297.625,"Did he say, Mr. Zerkin, as you have told us, I will instruct you as to the law, or did he say, I will instruct you as to the law?"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1297.625,1301.446,"He said, it's the duty of the court... he said, it's the duty of the court now."
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.446,1304.619,"He said, it is the duty of the court to instruct you as to the law?"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1304.619,1304.999,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.999,1307.47,"Or did he say, it is the duty of the court to instruct you as to the law?"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1307.801,1308.842,I'm not sure which way he did it.
1997.96-8400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.842,1310.041,"Well, I know you aren't."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1310.361,1316.836,"I don't know which way he did it, and I don't think that would make the difference, or make up for the complete lack of guidance we have here."
1997.96-8400,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.836,1319.157,May I ask you if the instructions went to the jury?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1319.157,1325.112,"The written instruction, one instruction and the verdict form went to the jury, that's correct."
1997.96-8400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1325.112,1328.384,"The written instructions, all of them, or what?"
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1328.384,1335.249,"Well, there's only one jury instruction, and that and the verdict forms went to the jury."
1997.96-8400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1337.622,1340.074,And the verdict form included the word mitigation?
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1340.074,1342.775,"It said... the verdict form said, we... having considered the evidence in mitigation."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1359.205,1370.735,"Mr. Zerkin, you've not made any mention... I don't think I found any in your brief... about whether the rule you're arguing for might be Teague barred."
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1370.735,1373.295,"--We certainly think it is not Teague barred, Judge."
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1373.295,1374.836,But you did not address this.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1374.836,1376.627,"We did not address it there, and we think--"
1997.96-8400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1376.627,1378.7,Although the State has addressed it.
1997.96-8400,0,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1378.7,1383.321,"--The State has addressed it, and we think that their argument on two points is so clearly wrong."
1997.96-8400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.486,1466.136,"Very well, Mr. Zerkin."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1467.979,1478.723,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-8400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1513.136,1518.999,"But weren't there additional instructions that were requested and specifically denied, and wasn't there--"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1518.999,1527.585,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I think it's very important to know exactly what those instructions were as far as what this Court has said the Eighth Amendment requires."
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1576.478,1580.79,"--May I ask... I think you're right in what you're saying, but do you think it would have been error for the judge to give the instruction?"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1580.79,1596.741,"Under Virginia law, the Virginia supreme court has interpreted the Virginia statutory system to say that trial courts should not give specific instructions on specific factors, because to do so could--"
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.741,1598.592,It suggests that there may be no catch all.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1608.448,1613.271,"--Under the Virginia supreme court rule it would, and the issue before the Court--"
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.271,1624.578,"Why would it have been... under... if the error is in not letting... letting them think they can't consider other mitigating evidence if the judge expressly said you may do so, how could that violate the Virginia rule?"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1624.578,1631.233,"--Well, because what the Virginia supreme court has said, and the issue before the Court today, is whether that was constitutionally reasonable."
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.0,1640.569,How could it run that risk if he expressly said otherwise?
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1644.142,1649.014,"If he was... Justice Stevens, if he was also given the catch all, is that the question?"
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.014,1649.234,"--Yeah, that--"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1649.234,1654.487,"Well, it's our position that the Virginia pattern instructions which were given in this case accomplished that fact."
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.66,1657.22,--But don't--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1666.067,1667.077,"No... no, you are correct."
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1667.077,1667.308,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1667.308,1673.782,And in fact in some cases a particular judge has used his discretion to give instructions further than... that go further--
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.782,1674.012,Right.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1674.012,1675.592,"--than the Virginia pattern instructions, and--"
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1675.592,1678.124,"No, but I thought it would be error... say, for example, take the age instruction."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1692.724,1692.893,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1692.893,1705.602,"I mean, the jury may or may not decide that his given age was a factor in mitigation, but it would have been error, I take it, to instruct the jury that it was a mitigating factor."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1705.602,1705.853,Yes.
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1705.853,1706.924,And that's what he asked for.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1706.924,1712.858,"Yes, you're absolutely... in fact, the age instruction, which is on page 76 of the appendix, is different from the other three."
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1719.061,1719.291,Right.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1719.291,1722.342,"It says, the age of Douglas Buchanan is a fact which mitigates."
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.342,1723.143,"Well, so do the other ones."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1727.697,1728.076,Correct.
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.076,1728.897,--mental or emotional disturbance.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1731.679,1731.899,That--
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.899,1738.203,"Whereas the Virginia statute says, facts in mitigation may include, but shall not be limited to."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1738.203,1738.894,"--That's correct, and that's why the--"
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.894,1740.093,It does not say facts in mitigation--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1740.894,1741.295,--And that--
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.295,1742.016,It's up to the jury whether--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1742.016,1758.238,"--That's right, and that is why the Virginia supreme court has interpreted the statutory system to... such that the courts should not and may not give specific instructions that highlight or single out certain factors which may or may not be mitigating."
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1758.238,1779.292,"--What about what I think is a separate argument, a totally separate argument, is not on page 75 but on page 74, and in instruction (A)(B) what he does is, he asks the judge in a separate matter that was separately refused simply to tell the jury that they can consider anything in mitigation growing out of the person or the crime."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1812.383,1814.384,"No, I disagree with you, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.384,1814.604,"Oh, you do."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1815.426,1823.31,Because I think... and my argument is not that he has not preserved an objection to the refusal of these instructions.
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1823.31,1823.581,All right.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1824.031,1826.663,"My argument is, that is all that he has preserved, not that he's--"
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1826.663,1826.853,"--Oh, fine."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1844.335,1858.103,"--My response is still that he is not... I don't believe... his argument on brief and his argument this morning is to look at the Virginia pattern instructions that are given and to complain that the phrase, all the evidence, does not--"
1997.96-8400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1858.103,1858.343,I thought--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1858.343,1859.415,--Does not allow--
1997.96-8400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1859.415,1863.037,--Mr. Zerkin made it clear that that was the model instruction.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1863.037,1863.706,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1863.706,1883.1,"He did say to me, although it was somewhat equivocal, that it would be enough to say, and you may take into account all the evidence, including the mitigating evidence, which, as Justice Breyer pointed out, is essentially what instruction (A)(B) seeks, and that was denied."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1892.256,1900.27,If his argument is somehow only married to that one instruction... and I don't think so.
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.011,1902.802,He has a separate argument.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1902.802,1903.323,--Right.
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.323,1910.028,"Which I think is married to the instruction, which is that the pattern instruction would be fine if they'd given (A)(B)."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1912.75,1914.069,But it's merely duplicative.
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.051,1925.118,"Counsel, (A)(B) includes as its first words, in addition to the mitigating factors specified in other instructions."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1925.118,1925.716,Right.
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.807,1929.481,Do you think (A)(B)... meaning the ones later on.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1929.481,1929.849,Correct.
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.849,1931.141,The things did come in a package.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1931.141,1949.142,"Correct, and in fact the record... it's not in the appendix, but in the record of the case, what the... what Buchanan actually asked for initially, and then he himself voluntarily withdrew, were a number of jury verdict forms and other instructions that clearly set the whole system up as a weighing system."
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1949.142,1954.506,"Okay, but didn't... I want to get clear on (A)(B) and the question whether we've got a case here."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1987.588,1987.839,Mm hmm.
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1987.839,1989.137,But then there's a second sentence.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2008.672,2011.754,I'm looking at the second sentence.
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2011.754,2012.035,Yeah.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2012.035,2016.387,"And there would be nothing wrong with that, that one sentence, but that's not the instruction that was offered."
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2016.387,2018.898,"Oh, I quite agree, but I mean, we've got two issues here."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2030.558,2047.348,"Well, frankly it's been hard for me to figure out exactly what the issue is that he is saying the Eighth Amendment requires in this case, because it seems to me he's changed it from trial to direct appeal to collateral review to here, and I think that the important issue for this Court to decide is, this is a coll... this is a case that is 10 years old."
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.669,2155.737,"Ms. Baldwin, the questions presented in petitioner's petition for certiorari, the first question... I think it's the first one that we granted cert on... does say, is the Eighth Amendment right to be free from arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty violated when the jury is not instructed regarding the existence of statutorily defined mitigating circumstances, so I really... I took it to be a requirement that the jury... (A)(B) wasn't at issue."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2163.892,2176.952,"Well, what Buchanan has argued all... what he argued on direct appeal, which is what we say is preserved, was that his instructions that were refused were a violation of the Eighth Amendment, and that included instruction (A)(B)."
1997.96-8400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2176.952,2188.991,"Well, in fairness to the petitioner, the question presented also concludes with, where the jury charge is devoid of any reference to the concept of mitigation, so we can... can we discuss just that--"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2188.991,2193.722,"Now, that was definitely not preserved, Justice Kennedy, absolutely not, because there was--"
1997.96-8400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2193.722,2195.753,"--Well, let's assume... let's assume that it was preserved."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2195.753,2196.474,--All right.
1997.96-8400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2196.474,2210.363,"His argument is that, given our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, you have to give the jury some framework, some guidance for considering whether or not factors that have been introduced into evidence may be mitigating."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2214.066,2217.108,"To my knowledge, this Court has never held that."
1997.96-8400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2234.908,2242.683,"--Can a... does a juror perform his or her constitutional duty when he says, I'm not going to consider any evidence of mitigation in this case?"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2245.367,2247.668,"--No, he... that's a violation of the Eighth Amendment."
1997.96-8400,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2251.579,2256.414,"And it's a violation of a judge's charge to the jury here if he tells them to consider all the evidence, isn't it?"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2256.414,2257.783,--The--
1997.96-8400,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.783,2268.362,"I mean, if a juror that Justice Kennedy hypothesized were to say, I'm not going to consider any mitigating... he would be violating the judge's charge to the jury."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2268.362,2269.213,--That's exactly right.
1997.96-8400,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.213,2270.333,Which told the jury to consider all the evidence.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2270.333,2270.964,That's exactly right.
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2271.194,2271.895,Is that right?
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2274.706,2275.334,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.985,2281.319,"Leaving aside the structural thing and whether you have to structure it or not, let me go back to Justice O'Connor's original point."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2380.485,2388.21,"--Well, the standard comes from Boyde, and Boyde says that the standard is not if there's a possibility that there was some misunderstanding."
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2388.21,2388.841,"Yeah, a reasonable likelihood--"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2388.841,2389.031,Or incorrect--
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.031,2389.491,--Mm hmm.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2389.491,2391.532,--But there has to be a reasonable likelihood--
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2391.532,2393.413,That's why I used my voice... isn't there a reasonable likelihood.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2394.423,2396.203,--There can't be in this case.
1997.96-8400,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2406.33,2411.493,"--Well, you say it's not because you have to look at the arguments of counsel and so forth, I assume."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2411.493,2413.116,--That you have to look at everything.
1997.96-8400,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2413.546,2433.029,"But if you read it as Justice Breyer did, that is troublesome indeed, because the instruction has collapsed both the eligibility for a death penalty factor in with the sentencing factors in a single instruction."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2433.029,2433.329,--Well--
1997.96-8400,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2433.329,2434.481,That is troublesome.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2451.851,2462.218,"--Justice O'Connor, I don't think it does... collapses the two parts at all, because the eligibility instructions are in the first... are in the second paragraph."
1997.96-8400,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.674,2503.547,What about Justice O'Connor's question?
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2512.623,2520.107,"I don't believe it is at all, and I think especially because the record shows that Buchanan agreed to these... to the pattern instructions."
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.107,2525.051,"--Well, I also what to say, I don't agree that the words that Justice Breyer left out are inconsequential."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2526.731,2528.552,They're the whole guts of it.
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2528.552,2548.636,"--Everything is summarized in the second paragraph, the requirements that must be proven, and then the court says, if you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the requirements of the preceding paragraph, then you may fix the punishment of the defendant at death, or if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2550.738,2553.579,It is complete... it is our position that it is completely--
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2553.579,2558.462,"--Well, I think the only words I left out were the word life imprisonment and reasonable doubt."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2581.446,2583.289,--Well--
1997.96-8400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2583.289,2583.87,And--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2583.87,2585.009,--you can't stop because--
1997.96-8400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2585.009,2592.926,"--Well, if you believe from all the evidence that a death penalty is not justified, that indicates that maybe the aggravating factors have not been established."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2592.926,2594.416,"--Well, the important word here--"
1997.96-8400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2594.416,2602.1,"And so... so all the defendant is saying is, in this context you should say something about mitigation, what I want you to tell them about is the statutory factors."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2610.207,2612.998,"--Well, and it's our position that Virginia does that."
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.251,2651.313,Is it correct--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2651.313,2651.934,"Now, if you find--"
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.934,2653.313,--I'm sorry.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2654.315,2655.106,--Thank you.
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.793,2668.544,It seems to me that you're--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2668.544,2675.189,--To say that the jury is going to read this and stop there and not read the rest of their instructions is a presumption that I don't think this Court has ever indulged in.
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.189,2676.158,--But isn't--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2676.158,2677.79,That a jury doesn't read it's instructions.
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.79,2689.037,"--Isn't it correct that you're assuming that the jury would interpret the word or in that instruction as saying, in effect, but even if you do so find, you may nevertheless do the rest?"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2702.027,2714.706,"Well, I think the... I think instruction is incredibly simple, and I think that no... it's not a reasonable probability, I don't think it's any probability that a jury, reading this entire instruction--"
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.706,2715.115,Would be--
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2715.115,2724.07,"--could possibly come away with the belief that they somehow can't consider mitigation, they can't consider the evidence that the defendant's put on for 2 days--"
1997.96-8400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.07,2755.292,"--It is dysjunctive, and the question, I suppose, is whether a reasonable jury would think that what the dysjunction is is between, if you find, and then you... or if you believe, or whether it's between, then you may fix the punishment at death, or, then you shall fix the punishment at life imprisonment, and it seems to me that the latter dysjunction is much more reasonable."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2755.292,2757.713,"--Yes, I agree, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.713,2762.255,May I ask another... I... we sort of milked this paragraph to death.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2777.044,2787.122,That's not correct because... I think because of what the Court has said in case after case about States being free to structure and shape their sentencing hearings.
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.783,2811.778,"Well, maybe that's not an argument that should persuade us, but I'm just kind of asking you, can you name another State in which this instruction would have been sufficient?"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2811.778,2814.32,I think what Justice Breyer pointed out in Texas.
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.667,2826.007,Right.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2826.007,2829.548,The Virginia system is that even if an aggravating factor is found--
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.548,2830.339,I understand.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2830.339,2835.004,"--and no mitigating factors, a jury in Virginia is still free to give a life sentence."
1997.96-8400,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.037,2841.827,We're not challenging the system as a whole.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2856.045,2860.379,"I don't know that their argument is that no other State would have accepted it, Justice Stevens."
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.533,2905.379,"Well, on that particular point, I'm a little bit concerned, because what the prosecutor said in the course of virtually conceding that they should take into account mitigation--"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2905.379,2905.689,Yes.
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.689,2909.042,"--He says, well, you are entitled to follow your own caprice."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2909.042,2909.24,Yes.
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2909.24,2913.284,"Well, I mean, I'm sitting there, a jury, thinking maybe he means that we don't have to follow the law."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2916.897,2918.036,I think that's taking a--
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2918.036,2921.639,--a clear statement that you can take mitigation into account under the law.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2921.639,2923.191,--I think that's taken--
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.191,2924.012,So I'm raising this to get your response.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2924.012,2925.543,--I think that's one word taken out of context.
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.543,2925.793,Mm hmm.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2925.793,2927.473,And if you look at the context of the prosecutor's--
1997.96-8400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.473,2927.894,He said enough in the rest of it.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2927.894,2943.344,"--argument he made very clear that what he was talking about specifically was, even if you find vileness, jury, it's your duty to consider his mitigation, and you can come back with a life sentence, and I'm not going to tell you anything different because that's not the law, and that's what the prosecutor said over and over."
1997.96-8400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2960.255,2966.529,"Couldn't the jury say, the prosecutor and the defense counsel spoke about mitigation."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2991.704,2997.259,"--But there has never been a ruling that a State court has to use a specific word, even the word mitigation."
1997.96-8400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2999.872,3001.171,But it is used now.
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3004.433,3004.633,Yes.
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3059.37,3063.632,"The instructions were given to them in writing and they took them into the jury room, is that correct?"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3063.632,3081.063,"--As well as two written verdict forms, one for life and one for death, and the judge read in open court the jury instructions and said I'm also sending back the jury verdict forms with you, and then the prosecutor in his closing argument read the jury verdict form, including the words certifying that they had considered the evidence in mitigation."
1997.96-8400,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3081.063,3082.905,"But the instructions went into the jury room, too?"
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3082.905,3102.507,"And the instructions went into the jury room, and it is I think a cynical view of juries to say that they did not read these instructions, or did not read the verdict form, and then certified that they had in fact considered the evidence in mitigation, when that was the only issue before the jury for 2 days of evidence."
1997.96-8400,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.356,3147.047,"Thank you, Ms. Baldwin."
1997.96-8400,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3147.047,3147.378,--Thank you.
1997.96-8400,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.378,3149.148,"Mr. Zerkin, you have 5 minutes remaining."
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3161.225,3161.546,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-8400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3175.447,3194.178,"Well, but I would think... Justice Kennedy can speak better than I, what he's talking about... what I would be interested in, and if... is this particular point, that this third paragraph of the instruction, the word or, because of its dysjunctive phrasing, was that raised, and if so when and where?"
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3194.178,3195.389,--The issue of--
1997.96-8400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3195.389,3198.702,Answer... I think that can be answered yes or no.
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3198.702,3203.925,"--I think the answer to that is no, that it was not specifically... that that was not specifically raised."
1997.96-8400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.353,3280.555,You say it's on page 19 to 20 of your cert petition?
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3280.855,3284.558,--At the bottom of 19 it talk--
1997.96-8400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3284.558,3284.799,--Yes.
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3284.799,3287.65,"--It talks about, absent any instruction on the meaning of mitigation."
1997.96-8400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3287.65,3304.66,"On the meaning of mitigation and what kinds of evidence comprise mitigation, which I think goes to the same point that you raise in question 1 of the question presented, that the specific mitigating circumstances, the statutorily defined ones, were not the subject of the instruction."
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3304.66,3314.427,"But as Justice Breyer pointed out, also in that question is that, despite counsel's request for such instructions, and where the jury charge is devoid of any reference to mitigation."
1997.96-8400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3318.719,3321.033,"But that doesn't specify the dysjunctive, or."
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3321.711,3323.563,"Yes, you are correct."
1997.96-8400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3344.889,3367.352,"--So what you raised... I'm trying to be favorable to you in this question, because I want to see if you... and so don't let me be too favorable, but I take it you'd raise the fact that the instruction, perhaps because of the word or, or without it, or it didn't mention it, is a zero, and since it's a zero, there's nothing about mitigation and you have to say something."
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3367.352,3368.842,--That's correct.
1997.96-8400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3369.383,3373.136,"And in your calling it a zero, did you talk about the word or, or not?"
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3373.136,3374.286,--I don't think we talked about the word or.
1997.96-8400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3412.83,3416.834,"Well, it does say having considered... it does say having considered all of the evidence in aggravation and mitigation."
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3416.834,3429.542,"It does, and if we assume that that's part of the jury instruction and the jury looked at it, we have that additional problem that the aggravating circumstance only results in death, and it's... where no aggravating circumstance is found results in life."
1997.96-8400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3429.542,3431.463,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Zerkin."
1997.96-8400,2,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3431.463,3431.664,Thank you.
1997.96-8400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.664,3432.764,The case is submitted.
