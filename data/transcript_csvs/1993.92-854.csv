1993.92-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.779,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-854, the Central Bank of Denver v. the First Interstate Bank of Denver."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,12.158,15.17,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.85,108.112,What was that act?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,108.112,117.699,"--The act that they claim Central Bank engaged in, Your Honor, was to delay, if you will, an appraisal until after the bonds were issued."
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,126.184,128.866,May I just ask one other question--
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,128.866,129.136,Sure.
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,129.136,130.006,--the delay.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,139.042,139.883,Yes.
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,148.447,155.083,"And whether they did it or not was entirely discretionary, no standards about whether they had any duty to--"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,155.083,157.052,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,157.052,160.365,"--Why, under the agreement, did they have anything to say about the appraisal?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,160.365,167.031,"Well, an indenture trustee essentially has ministerial acts, carries out ministerial acts."
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,182.912,187.774,"But would the decision of whether to delay or not delay the appraisal be a ministerial act, in your view?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,187.774,198.52,"It would be... I don't know what label you would put on it, but it would be an act that the trustee could decide in its sound discretion, and the whole purpose of doing that--"
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,198.52,203.415,It seems to me there's some tension between the notion that it's a discretionary matter and it's a ministerial matter.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,206.985,210.308,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it would be a discretionary matter."
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,210.308,215.413,So the duties of the indenture trustee are not entirely ministerial.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,215.413,216.142,That's correct.
1993.92-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.632,251.015,Is there a requirement that it be done in concert with the principal actor?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,251.015,254.897,"The courts don't seem to be saying that, Your Honor."
1993.92-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.818,256.238,I mean--
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,256.238,256.769,--What they--
1993.92-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.769,265.336,--could the substantial assistance required by the other circuits be rendered unconscious of the fact that it is substantial assistance?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,265.336,289.011,"--It appears that that is the case, and I think that's exactly what has happened in this particular case, is that you have a situation where a professional, a bank in this particular case, was acting pursuant to its duties, and pursuant to its discretion, and is accused here in taking an act which essentially allowed a fraud to occur."
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.111,295.954,"Mr. Trautman, it seems to me that it really is a quite separate offense from the fraud itself, however."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,308.132,310.015,"--That appears to be the case, Your--"
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.015,315.869,"Whereas with contribution, of course, you can't be compelled to contribute unless the principal has been held liable."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,315.869,317.308,--That's correct.
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.308,327.446,"Well, it seems to me to separate it from the... you know, the kind of inevitable accompaniments of private rights of action that we've found in the past in Musick, for example."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,327.446,337.263,"We agree, Your Honor, because the aiding and abetting act, if you will, is not necessarily deceptive or manipulative."
1993.92-854,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,337.263,345.168,"Although as I understand it you didn't question that in the district court, and the district court ruled simply on the state of mind question, is that not so?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,345.168,349.981,"We did not raise the issue of whether there was a private right of action because it would have been fruitless, Your Honor."
1993.92-854,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.981,355.634,"It would have been fruitless because the law was so solidly against you in the lower courts, is that--"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,355.634,371.375,"The Tenth Circuit had found in 1974, without any analysis whatsoever... they had assumed that there was a private right of action, and we think that those cases, Your Honor, essentially are premised upon a methodology that this Court has now abandoned."
1993.92-854,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,385.203,389.157,"--But you're arguing here that there shouldn't be any aiding and abetting liability, period."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,394.449,396.4,That's correct.
1993.92-854,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.4,396.76,Okay.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,410.25,411.93,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-854,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.622,474.252,Silent as to the Commission as well as the individual.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,487.26,487.581,--No.
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.884,528.948,"That is to say, it is not the private cause of action that we have heretofore recognized."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,528.948,529.667,--That's correct.
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.667,533.72,And we're not going to recognize any other private causes of action under 10(b).
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,533.72,534.581,That is correct.
1993.92-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.581,549.89,"Under the allegations of the complaint taken in the light most favorably to the plaintiff, could there have been a cause of action or an allegation for liability as co... of the bank as coconspirator?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,549.89,553.362,"Well, I suppose there could have been any allegation at the onset."
1993.92-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.879,570.643,"Well, suppose they alleged that there was an agreement to hold up the appraisal, and then alleged that this was a conspiracy, would that be a separate cause of action?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,570.643,574.266,"In our view, a conspiracy would also be a separate cause of action."
1993.92-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,574.266,580.43,"Has it been treated as such in the writings, in the general law of torts?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,580.43,606.687,"In the general law of torts, conspiracy has been considered as part of the underlying tort, but here, and the problem we have with aiding and abetting, I think it's the same problem you have with conspiracy, is what the courts have tended to do is just to assume that these peripheral rights are there without any analysis as to whether Congress really intended them to be there, and if, in fact, the key is--"
1993.92-854,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,606.687,612.241,We all agreed that Congress didn't provide any indicia of intent.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,615.172,615.984,--That's correct.
1993.92-854,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,615.984,642.621,"The question, as Justice Scalia raised, is whether it really falls within sort of the rounding-out jurisprudence, and I mean, Justice Kennedy's point is that they could have been pursued on a conspiracy theory, and at least on traditional tort principles that would not have been regarded as a departure, and if that's so, why should this be regarded as a departure?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,642.621,648.876,"Well, I think the difference... there is a difference between aiding and abetting and conspiracy, and let me just focus on that for a moment."
1993.92-854,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,696.117,708.245,"Well, in a sense... in a sense, conspiracy requires an element that aiding and abetting doesn't, namely, an agreement, so in a sense, an aider and abettor is acting closer to the principal actor than is a conspirator."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,708.245,733.51,"--That's correct, but there is a difference in terms of the actual... you see, my problem with what the lower courts have done is that they have focused on this substantial assistance issue, and they've lost their eye on the ball, and the ball really here is, did my client engage in deceptive or manipulative conduct, and if they did, they could be sued as a primary violator."
1993.92-854,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,772.255,772.716,But do you--
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,783.142,790.709,"Well, the reason why you can't say that, Your Honor, is because manipulative practice has really focused on two concepts."
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,802.617,813.542,Do you acknowledge that this horrible thing which you just described could happen if your client was sued for conspiracy to violate 10(b)?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,813.542,815.974,Well--
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.974,819.316,What about a cause of action for conspiracy to violate 10(b)?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,820.438,823.89,"--Your Honor, obviously that is not presented here."
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.425,833.097,"I know it's different, but will you first answer my question?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,838.05,841.042,--I don't believe that there... I don't think this Court has ruled as such.
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.042,842.521,Do you think that there should be?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,842.521,843.453,"No, I don't."
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.453,844.784,For the same reason that--
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,844.784,845.513,Exactly.
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.513,846.174,--you have for your--
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,846.174,851.828,"And my point is, though, that you don't need to reach that, and in trying to respond to Justice Kennedy, I do think that there is a distinction."
1993.92-854,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.105,891.364,"--Mr. Trautman, in your response to me, were you suggesting that there must be a duty to disclose, otherwise you can't have liability as a principle, and if so, what case held that?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,891.364,894.126,"No, I'm not saying that there has to be just a duty to disclose."
1993.92-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.616,944.879,Who is the Mr. Trautman?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,944.879,945.408,This is the Congress.
1993.92-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,945.408,945.809,The Congress.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,945.809,947.251,I apologize.
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.217,984.014,"You are now making the broader argument in... under Justice Ginsburg's question, so if we agree with you on this argument, even the SEC could not enforce aiding and abetting liability."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,984.014,987.426,"--Well, Your Honor, I think there maybe three levels to go with this."
1993.92-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1133.074,1146.872,"May I ask you, counsel, if you would concede that recklessness is a sufficient mens rea to satisfy any scienter requirement for primary liability?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1146.872,1153.337,"Well, Your Honor, we think that that question obviously is not raised here, does not have to be decided, but if in fact--"
1993.92-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1153.337,1154.446,"No, but would you answer the question?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1154.446,1171.129,"--If in fact... if in fact that question were presented, we think that the proper approach would be to look at the words of 10(b) and to say that you cannot have a reckless manipulation, you cannot have a reckless device, so I don't think it should."
1993.92-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1175.35,1179.693,Have most of the courts of appeals held that recklessness is sufficient--
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1179.693,1180.214,--Yes.
1993.92-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1180.214,1181.644,--in the primary liability--
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1181.644,1182.215,"Yes, they have."
1993.92-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1182.215,1183.106,--the same?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1183.106,1183.685,They have.
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.685,1185.658,"I think all of them have, haven't they?"
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1185.658,1185.938,Yes.
1993.92-854,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.938,1186.587,Yes.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1186.587,1187.468,"They all have, Your Honor."
1993.92-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1205.651,1209.902,We might approach it just the other way and say clearly its enough under primary--
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1209.902,1211.384,--Exactly.
1993.92-854,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1211.384,1215.207,--liability and why shouldn't it be enough if there's aiding and abetting?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1215.207,1247.889,"Okay, and the reason why there shouldn't be enough if it's aiding and abetting would be to recognize that... if you find that there is a separate cause of action for aiding and abetting, or that there is an additional cause of action implied by Congress for aiding and abetting, the principal difference being that that is one step removed from a primary violation and yet carries with it joint and several liability, and so there is a logical basis for saying that in that circumstance we're going to require a higher degree of knowledge or scienter than we are in the primary violation."
1993.92-854,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.736,1306.887,It's predictably flexible.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1306.887,1307.636,Exactly.
1993.92-854,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.314,1382.385,In this case you've got one other ingredient.
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1387.078,1387.919,--I'm sorry?
1993.92-854,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1387.919,1396.284,"In this case you've got another factual ingredient, because the bank took another $2 million of collateral in order to be quiet about it until after the '88 issue."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1396.284,1400.898,"No, the $2 million of collateral, Your Honor, related to an earlier bond issue."
1993.92-854,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1400.898,1412.706,"No, I realize it did, but they accepted the collateral for that earlier bond issue as part of their... or as the consideration for their agreement to insist on no immediate reappraisal."
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1412.706,1423.371,"Inevitably in these transactions problems are going to come up and problems have to be resolved, and I think Your Honor's point is well taken, is that there is certainly give-and-take with respect to these."
1993.92-854,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1492.268,1495.48,How did the Tenth Circuit define recklessness?
1993.92-854,0,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1499.06,1506.626,"It defined it... it essentially used the Sundstrand approach, which was that it had to be an extreme departure from a standard of care."
1993.92-854,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.256,1537.937,"--Very well, Mr. Trautman."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1540.1,1545.233,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.821,1604.832,There is this--
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1622.554,1633.791,"Contribution, Justice Rehnquist, it's correct... Chief Justice... is a different form, in other words, of secondary liability from aiding and abetting."
1993.92-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1633.791,1635.821,"Well, I'm not sure that it's secondary liability."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1648.56,1654.644,"It... in other words, it's not allocation among primarily liable parties."
1993.92-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1654.644,1656.036,"In Musick, yes."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1656.036,1656.275,--that's correct.
1993.92-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1656.275,1662.579,"In Musick, the premise was that there was a duty under the Securities Act."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1662.579,1665.19,"That is a difference, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.748,1835.473,"Well, certainly, but it's not really joint tortfeasor liability because you can find one guilty and the other not guilty."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1835.473,1837.094,--I think the Court--
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.094,1840.256,That's wherein this differs a whole lot from contribution.
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1847.862,1861.439,"--In the aiding and abetting cause, Your Honor, the first element, Justice Scalia, would be that there was a primary violation, so--"
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.439,1882.644,"You have to get the jury who's trying the aider and abettor to find that there was a primary violation, but another jury could have found that the primary violator in fact didn't do it, and it would not eliminate the aiding and abetting liability, whereas with contribution, if the primary offender is not found liable, there's no question that there can't be any contribution."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1882.644,1891.088,"--The link... at least with aiding and abetting, justice Scalia, there is a direct link to the primary violation in the first element of the aiding and abetting cause."
1993.92-854,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1908.15,1922.439,"Mr. Gersh, would liability as an aider and abettor be available as a theory for your client against the lawyer that advised the bank, and perhaps the accountant--"
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1922.439,1924.442,If they had--
1993.92-854,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.442,1926.732,--as well as the bank?
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1944.234,1952.629,"--Knowledge, participation... knowledge and substantial assistance in a primary violation would all have to be proved with respect to that lawyer."
1993.92-854,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.379,1957.662,"Well, assistance to the bank to do whatever the bank was doing."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,1957.662,1966.477,"--It would have to be, Justice O'Connor, not just assistance to the bank, but substantial assistance in the fraud."
1993.92-854,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2009.426,2023.546,"Mr. Gersh, do you concede that you could not have charged Central Bank as a primary violator so that you were forced into the aiding and abetting mode?"
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2023.546,2024.026,--Yes.
1993.92-854,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2024.026,2025.185,You concede that.
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2025.185,2026.667,"Yes, I would concede that."
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.375,2161.665,Mr. Gersh--
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2161.665,2165.979,This is one of those items that will round out an existing cause of action.
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.979,2166.73,"--Well, that's a different question."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2227.148,2249.452,"Justice Scalia, I would say that the rounding out test is related in this sense, that there is no rounding out doctrine in any of the Court rounding out cases... Lampf, Musick, Peeler... that is separate from the question of how Congress would have originally designed the cause of action."
1993.92-854,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2288.598,2289.189,"Well, they overlap."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2307.881,2309.822,"--No, I think that that's... I think that that's true."
1993.92-854,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2359.324,2368.0,"As a matter of fact, in the law of torts generally, I can't off-hand... maybe you can help me... think of an example where an aider and abettor is not liable for the commission of a tort."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2368.0,2371.072,"--Your Honor... Justice Kennedy, I would agree."
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.645,2489.86,"It may well for the principal offense, but does it for the allied offense of aiding and abetting?"
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2494.671,2497.305,"--I'm not certain about conspiracy, but as to aiding--"
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.305,2497.593,I am.
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2510.042,2532.561,"--As for aiding and abetting, the cases of aiding and abetting common law deceit, the ones that we located, do say that... include recklessness, or reach recklessness, Your Honor, so as to the aiding and abetting, the history of aiding and abetting, recklessness was the standard there as well."
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.561,2533.913,Where are those cases in your brief?
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2534.483,2539.497,I think we cite these cases--
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.497,2547.742,"Well, go on."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2550.453,2570.267,"--In the footnote, which is on page 34 of our brief, footnote number 27, we cite a number of these cases, and then I think we also in the text cite... we do cite in the text several aiding and abetting cases as well."
1993.92-854,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.267,2577.841,"But... yes, but most of those cases... as far as the text shows, all of those cases involve the tort of deceit, includes reckless behavior."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2597.325,2628.486,"Actually, Justice Scalia, if you look at the... if you look at the criminal law, which if anything should have a more stringent form of intent, the criminal law uses recklessness, or defines the intent necessary for aiding and abetting as reckless, at least in some of the cases, and it's... the level of intent required for aiding and abetting has been considered to be a general intent, closer to general intent and not specific intent."
1993.92-854,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2629.397,2645.054,"Well, when you're talking about aiding and abetting someone else who might deceive or manipulate, I take it that it would be a requirement that the aider and abettor at least appreciate that there may be someone in a position to manipulate or to deceive who would be helped by the aider and abettor's conduct."
1993.92-854,1,35957,miles_m_gersh,,2700.743,2708.387,"--I would agree, Justice Souter, and I would also add to that that the recklessness standard is a stringent one."
1993.92-854,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.958,2726.449,"Thank you, Mr. Gersh."
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2728.67,2740.497,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-854,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.345,2847.558,Did that case speak about the necessary intent for the aider and abettor of agreement--
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2847.558,2851.719,"No, this is just the existence of aider and abettor liability on that case, Your Honor."
1993.92-854,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.688,2904.186,"--You think Congress when it enacted section 2 of title 18, which applies to the whole criminal code, really had this narrow problem in mind here?"
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2904.186,2917.745,"No, my point is that as applied to section 10(b), Congress has deemed and in fact held criminally responsible persons who substantially participate in a violation of section 10(b)."
1993.92-854,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.298,2950.896,"One can make the opposite argument from Article 2, and that is that if it was a rounding out matter, you wouldn't even have to have section 2, that it would automatically go along."
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2950.896,2952.516,"Well, no--"
1993.92-854,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2952.516,2957.021,"Congress felt the need to say, by the way, aiders and abettors will be held the same as principals."
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2957.021,2980.115,"--Well, in the criminal law context, you would of course need a statute to say who is responsible, and the reason the Congress had adopted... enacted section 2, as this Court said in Standefer, was to, for example, overcome the common law rule that if the principal is acquitted the aider and abettor could not be found liable, and Congress wanted to eliminate that artificial distinction."
1993.92-854,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.488,3013.287,Is it the position of the SEC that there was sufficient evidence here to support a finding that the petitioner substantially participated in the circumstances of delaying the appraisal?
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3013.287,3015.037,"Yeah, we think there's... yes."
1993.92-854,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3022.713,3025.235,"Well, the agree... I wasn't aware there was an agreement."
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3028.725,3040.293,"No, there was a letter agreement... a letter from the authority and developer endorsed by Central Bank to put off the appraisal until December of the issuing year, so it was... it was more than just--"
1993.92-854,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.293,3040.994,You say there was an agree--
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3040.994,3044.085,"--Right, there was a letter dated May 13th, I think, of 1988."
1993.92-854,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3193.465,3199.249,--Does the aider and abettor at least have to know that the primary participant has a duty under the securities laws?
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3199.249,3205.602,I don't think knowledge of the law is important.
1993.92-854,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.612,3229.917,Anyone who recklessly creates the conditions that enables someone else to perpetrate a fraud becomes an aider and abettor of the fraud?
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3229.917,3236.122,"--Yes, because he's participating in the perpetration of the fraud, and again, for example--"
1993.92-854,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3236.122,3249.14,"No, but you're saying... I think Justice Scalia and I both understood you to mean that the aider and abettor's act, as it were, can come first, before he knows of anyone in particular, or anyone in general that is likely--"
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3249.14,3253.412,"--Yes, and in theory he may not know who will be the ultimate principal."
1993.92-854,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3259.906,3263.75,--But he has to know... you're saying that he has to know that someone may be in a position to take advantage of what he's doing.
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3263.75,3264.06,"--Yes, right."
1993.92-854,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3264.06,3264.41,Okay.
1993.92-854,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3264.41,3267.651,"And again, a reference to section 9 of the act is useful."
1993.92-854,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3272.796,3273.786,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1993.92-854,3,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,3278.33,3280.21,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-854,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.042,3406.675,"Thank you, Mr. Trautman."
