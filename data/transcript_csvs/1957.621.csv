1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,452.316,457.106,"If -- that's right, it's the 275, would be in the bottom of that page."
1957.621,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,457.106,460.809,(Inaudible)
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,460.809,468.805,"Well then, there's a little supplement here and that at page 2 of that supplement as to page 275 of this record, I'm sorry."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,468.805,471.257,"Mr. Rand, may I trouble you to state again."
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,476.542,485.036,The direction of the Court of Appeals was that the Secretary do hear what they had directed the Secretary to do in its former Boudin case.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,511.704,524.067,"What -- perhaps I'm anticipating -- is what the Secretary did under -- on the date that is correct, October 4, 1956, is what he did in conformity of what he was directed to do?"
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,524.067,526.299,In complete conformity with what he was directed to do.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,534.19,541.282,"As I understand you, Mr. Rand, it went back to him and on the basis of -- of the record which is to inspect by them --"
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,541.282,541.434,So far as --
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,541.434,544.99,-- he then complied with what the Court of Appeals told him to do.
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,544.99,545.572,That's right.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,545.572,548.155,And then it goes back to the -- went back to the District Court?
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,548.155,548.785,That's right.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,548.957,555.825,"And there, you -- you challenged the justification of his findings under the statute, is that correct?"
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,555.825,556.77,Quite correct.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,575.138,578.548,Does -- do his findings shed any light on that question whether he did or didn't?
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,578.548,581.93,"Oh yes, there's no question that he considered confidential information --"
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,581.93,585.272,Other than what happened before and when you were before him.
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,585.272,588.833,"Oh certainly, there was -- we were -- that information was not disclosed to us."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,588.833,600.713,"I understand that but in addition to the record that was made out originally for all you know and did you say you do know, he considered additional matters which were not put into your disposal."
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,600.713,601.374,"Oh, no."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,611.595,613.228,So when you protest against which you want to impose?
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,613.228,614.407,Against which we protested.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,637.203,637.499,Well now --
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,637.499,637.612,I don't know --
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,637.612,641.357,"-- my question was, do his findings -- his findings neutral on that problem?"
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,641.357,645.042,His findings are neutral.
1957.621,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,664.506,666.544,(Inaudible)
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,666.544,674.429,"Your Honors, you -- you will find this on page 278 of the record, all five of that supplement."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,768.553,774.586,"The political -- the political ground being membership, well, he has denied that he is a member of a political ground."
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,774.586,774.943,That's right.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,787.538,789.828,Because this is different from the preceding case.
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,789.828,789.928,Quite --
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,789.928,791.737,Either there is a disavow of membership.
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,791.737,792.383,That's right.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,793.146,793.373,(Voice Overlap) --
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,793.373,802.373,"And there is no charge of membership and no finding of membership, nor is there any finding under subsection (b) that petitioner is a person who is supporting the Communist movement."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,810.347,817.176,"Now, are you saying that even if -- if you are a -- agreed, conceded that even if it were admitted."
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,824.328,824.487,Yes.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,824.487,831.543,"-- are you urging that that finding was made without an opportunity on your part, procedure to deal with it."
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,831.543,849.143,"I'm urging both and with respect to the first, I'm -- the first argument, I am prepared particularly in view of the limitations of time to rest on the arguments of petitioners in the previous case, although I understand that the different shades here with respect to -- to my case and petitioner's case."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,852.714,873.407,"But you -- are you saying that the Congress of the United States speaking as unequivocally as it can may not constitutionally say the Director of the Secretary of the State not to grant a passport, not to be at least to leave the country to a person who says, â€œI'm going to X country to promote the cause of the Communist Party."""
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,873.946,877.849,"Yes, using these particular standards, I would -- I would urge that as well."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,877.849,879.213,But what do mean by the standards?
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,879.213,884.015,That is if -- if the standard which the Congress legislated --
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,884.015,911.908,"It does said -- in use of term that I've just used roughly, in answer, you find out the fact and if you find the fact which convince you giving up to his -- for hearing and arrest that John Smith wants to go to India or Pakistan or anywhere else that you well on, wherever he goes to promote the cause of the Communist Party, will not be given a passport, you would say that's unconstitutional?"
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,911.908,913.962,"Yes, I would Your Honor although I don't have to reach that here."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,913.962,914.413,I understand.
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,914.413,922.882,"But I would say that's unconstitutional because well, for a variety of reasons, I would urge first the First Amendment right of preassembly in association."
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,927.772,928.958,Well I'm assuming that.
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,928.958,934.305,I would urge further that I don't -- that the -- the standards set up was not precise enough.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1174.49,1180.312,Does the Secretary state explicitly why he withholds disclosure of what -- of the defense?
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1180.312,1181.085,Yes.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1183.167,1184.008,What is their brief?
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1184.008,1187.579,On page 278 of the record.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1187.579,1190.078,278?
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1190.078,1191.884,It's in the -- the little supplement at the end.
1957.621,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1191.884,1192.354,"Oh, I beg your pardon?"
1957.621,0,27956,harry_i_rand,,1192.354,1196.129,"I'm sorry, I thought it was bound in which is page 5 of that supplement."

1957.621,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2737.449,2743.638,Did the Secretary (Inaudible)
1957.621,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2743.638,2747.54,The record does not show that he did and I assume that he did not.
1957.621,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2768.044,2780.211,(Inaudible) the Secretary to allege the petitioner's testimony alongside of the three witnesses and reach the conclusion that the petitioner must be the one who felt the credibility?
1957.621,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2780.211,2791.884,"That's my interpretation of the record and I -- I -- looking at the cold record, I do not think it's difficult to come to that conclusion."
1957.621,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2846.649,2849.982,How long before the hearing --
1957.621,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2849.982,2850.843,Did this occur?
1957.621,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2850.843,2851.328,-- did it occur?
1957.621,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2851.328,2853.901,It occurred five years before this hearing.

1957.621,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2902.543,2903.339,That's the way I read it.
1957.621,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,2903.339,2911.151,"Yes, and the other people as I know, as far as I know, have not been prosecuted."
