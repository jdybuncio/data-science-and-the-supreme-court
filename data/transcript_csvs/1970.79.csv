1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.924,"79, Connell against Higginbotham."
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,34.546,35.861,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,187.255,190.841,Would you have objected if it stopped after the first section?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,190.841,196.609,"Your Honor, we would object if the Florida oath were to stop after the first section."
1970.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.609,202.005,We have to overrule the decision in this -- very recent decision of this Court to in order to sustain your objection?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,202.005,215.165,"Justice Stewart, appellant requests that you consider the recent decisions of this Court which were not had after a full argument and briefing but only on summary affirmance of decisions below."
1970.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.165,216.65,But it wasn't affirmance on the merits?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,216.65,219.95,An affirmance of the merits in three cases in the --
1970.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.95,220.068,Right.
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,220.068,223.793,"-- last three years; Knight, Olson and Hosack."
1970.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,223.793,224.721,Right.
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,224.721,236.227,"But you think it is unconstitutional for this Court to require as we did this morning, seven or eight men to take an oath that they will support and defend the Constitution?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,236.227,245.918,"Your Honor, I'm not here to press the question of whether an Attorney maybe compelled to take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States."
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,411.03,413.426,I'm not sure I follow you on --
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,413.426,414.381,"On the hearing, Your Honor?"
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,414.381,418.05,"-- for lack of a hearing, hearing on what and at what stage?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,418.05,419.704,Alright.
1970.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,631.602,636.689,May I ask if you have filed a brief in addition to others filed with the jurisdictional statement?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,636.689,640.501,"Yes, Your Honor we did."
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,677.301,694.534,"Do you think that the First Amendment, amended Article VI which requires all state judicial officers, legislators and executive officers to support the Constitution of the United States?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,694.534,702.398,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I -- that's an intriguing question one that had not occurred to me before and I suggest that the answer would be --"
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,702.398,706.03,"Well, I would suggest that your brush is too broad."
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,706.03,708.235,"Now, I agree with you and if the --"
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,708.235,712.608,"You are saying the statute is too broad, I think your arguments are little broad?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,712.608,719.483,I was going to narrow the purview of my argument by suggesting what I meant by an indiscriminant test oath.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.635,725.236,"Well, I'd be [Voice Overlap]"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,725.236,739.733,"And certainly this Court in dictum, in Bond versus Floyd recognized that the State might well require of a state legislator, an oath that it could not require of a private citizen."
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.577,758.139,Did we make to the one and not to other?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,758.139,758.592,No.
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.71,767.302,[Inaudible]
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,767.302,767.806,I beg your pardon?
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.187,776.158,It was frankly that you were saying the vagueness of this oath?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,776.158,776.254,Oh!
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.724,780.282,Supporting constitution?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,780.282,787.473,"Well, if this oath is illuminated by a gloss provided by the Supreme Court of Florida which is controlling on the meaning of the oath now."
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,877.083,880.473,Why?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,880.473,885.584,"If I may suggest first that, it would be constitutional as the legislators, why?"
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,885.726,887.394,What about the executive officers?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,887.394,891.036,It would be constitutional as to executive officers in a sensitive post as well.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.036,893.777,Why?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,893.777,893.966,Because --
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,893.966,895.66,Because of Article VI?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,895.66,896.395,I beg your pardon.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,896.395,897.09,Because of Article VI?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,897.09,902.298,"Because of Article VI and even in the absence of Article VI, it might still stand."
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.298,904.716,What about policeman?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,904.716,909.5,Policeman provide a tougher case.
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,916.815,918.378,How about civics teachers?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,918.378,920.449,I think not.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,930.784,939.918,"Suppose this petitioner in this case, would you say did necessarily understand the oath, right?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,939.918,940.649,Yes sir.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,940.649,946.933,"Became a legislator, you couldn't give him oath, could you or could you?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,946.933,950.259,Do you mean the precise oath that was given to her for the particular oath?
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,950.259,952.048,Yes.
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,952.048,952.777,"Well, no."
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,958.951,964.221,"Well, could she get any relief in this Court?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,964.221,965.589,If she became a legislator?
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,965.589,965.753,No!
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,965.753,966.053,Under this law?
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,966.053,968.693,And she said that I don't have to take the oath?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,968.693,970.604,This particular oath?
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,970.604,973.985,The oath to support the Constitution of the United States?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,973.985,975.707,You mean if that were all there was?
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,975.707,976.878,Yes.
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,976.878,979.53,"No, she could not get relief from this Court."
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,979.53,985.593,"But what's the difference between her as a legislator and her as a teacher, the same oath?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,985.593,986.66,What is the difference?
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,986.66,988.807,The understanding of the oath form?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,988.807,994.844,"Well, on that point the vagueness, we're not pressing that particular point to vagueness."
1970.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1057.29,1067.44,I didn't quite understand how you distinguished public school teachers from lawyers for admission to practice?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1067.44,1069.326,"Well, there are two distinctions I would think Mr. Justice Stewart."
1970.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1069.326,1073.499,"Because you do concede that lawyers maybe required to take such an oath, do you not?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1073.499,1078.13,"Well, I concede that I have more trouble with the case of lawyers taking the oath --"
1970.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.13,1080.083,And we have a rule of this Court that requires --
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1080.083,1081.232,Certainly and the rules of this Court.
1970.79,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1081.232,1083.096,Everybody takes such an oath.
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1083.096,1086.719,"Yes, and if anyone declined to take it, he would not be admitted?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1086.719,1087.603,That's right.
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1104.899,1109.747,Do you think they make difference between doing that and signing it in writing?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1109.747,1111.861,"Originally, I believe there was a difference."
1970.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1149.619,1151.569,You think it's just symbol?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1151.569,1152.324,I beg your pardon?
1970.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1152.324,1154.799,"You think it's just symbol, ceremony of --"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1154.799,1173.484,"I assume that each man who takes the oath for high Government office takes it conscientiously and believes he understands what the oath means and he intends to uphold and support the Constitution of the United States, but in terms of the basic values of the society, yes, I think it is basically symbolic."
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1197.194,1199.803,You seem to put those two together all the time.
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1199.991,1202.082,"Well, [Laughter] I don't mean to in any --"
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1202.082,1203.381,Is that intentionally?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1203.381,1205.312,Pejorative fashion.
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1218.356,1219.782,But the case are now before us is a school teacher.
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1219.782,1220.486,Is a school teacher.
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1220.486,1224.309,"So we don't have to worry too much about the garbage collector, do we?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1224.309,1245.964,"In this case, this case you can not even worry about the affirmative oath question but of course in Cole versus Richardson which the Court remanded last year, the question has been refiled in the -- or Cole versus Richardson has been refiled before the Court and the question is being pressed upon the Court on a numerable occasions."
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1300.912,1310.82,You think -- you think that school teachers are entitled to more freedom in that respect than the Supreme Court justices and lawyers to practice before the Court?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1310.82,1314.754,"Yes, in that respect."
1970.79,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1363.942,1373.66,"Mr. Rosen, could I ask you, does the record disclose the grade at which your client taught?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1373.66,1377.042,She was either in the first or to the third grade Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1970.79,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1377.042,1388.033,"You draw any distinction between teaching in the elementary levels as compared with teaching in law school for instance, so far as the oath is concerned?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1388.033,1389.96,"No, we do not."
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.685,1533.333,Would you say concept of academic freedom go so far or maybe not so far as to say that a school or a university could not hire a professor who was advising students to use say violence to achieve their goals in the university?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1533.333,1540.645,"No, I would not say that Mr. Justice White, but that is not the same thing as requiring all professors to take loyalty."
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.645,1544.411,"Yes, well we'll get closer."
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1561.259,1562.896,Are they going to ask all teachers that?
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.896,1563.277,Yes.
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1563.277,1567.271,That's the functional equivalent of a loyalty oath at that point.
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.636,1585.756,"So, you would say a fortiori, you couldn't ask him, “Do you believe in the use of violence to achieve social ends?”"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1585.756,1587.971,"A fortiori, you could not ask him that."
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.971,1589.73,Alright.
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1589.73,1598.131,Because that is just a belief and numerable decisions of this Court have recognized it that you may not invade to protected province of a man --
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.131,1602.507,"Well, they may not leave or keep him out of his job for that, but I'm just wondering if you could ask him that?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1602.507,1605.332,"Well, you can always ask Mr. Justice White."
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.332,1609.713,"Well, I know but you'd say that you couldn't -- that if he refused to answer, you couldn't fire him?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1609.713,1611.134,That's right.
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.134,1623.952,"And you would say that's even -- you would say its bad even if the State conceded if the -- that if the answer is yes, they couldn't fire him without answering some other questions, without asking him some other questions?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1623.952,1629.76,"Well, you're trying to make the teacher's situation look much closer to the bar situation, I take it."
1970.79,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.76,1634.25,"Well, I don't know whether -- which way do you run that thing?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1634.25,1645.574,"Well, because of the fragility of academic freedom, I would think that you would have to put a greater protection around the teacher than around the lawyer, although the lawyer is entitled to a great deal of protection."
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1645.574,1650.57,"Could you ask him, have you ever been convicted of a crime or felony?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1650.57,1653.063,I believe he could.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1653.063,1658.987,Could you ask him as to whether he ever been discharged from a teaching position?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1658.987,1660.564,Yes.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.564,1663.616,Could you ask him why?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1663.616,1665.91,Yes.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1665.91,1669.232,"Well, how can you do that and not asking other questions?"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1669.232,1677.746,"Because when you're asking whether he's ever been convicted of a felony in most instances, you're dealing not with First Amendment activity."
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1681.084,1681.861,"Well, he had been --"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1681.861,1683.44,That has no bearing on the First Amendment.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1683.44,1687.056,Have you ever been convicted of burning your draft card?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1687.056,1689.026,I have more trouble with that case.
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1689.026,1696.589,I should hope so. [Attempt to Laughter] I just have great difficulty equating academic freedom with First Amendment.
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1699.598,1704.03,"If anything, academic freedom maybe a bit bigger than the First Amendment for the rest of --"
1970.79,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1704.03,1706.693,Except it hadn't been adopted yet?
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1706.693,1722.499,"Well, [Laughter] except that the gloss put upon the First Amendment by this Court in Whitehill and Keyishian and other decisions has recognized the terribly critical First Amendment part of academic freedom."
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.234,1795.309,"You can give us the citation, we'll check out Professor Emerson --"
1970.79,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1795.309,1798.408,At page 207 and 208.
1970.79,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.546,1822.238,"Thank you, Mr. Rosen."
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,1824.401,1825.726,"Yes sir, thank you sir."
1970.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2167.447,2172.753,I'm a little curious about the facts of this case.
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2172.753,2172.857,Yes.
1970.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2172.857,2187.767,"I note that the first oath submitted to the petitioner was the one that had been very explicitly invalidated by this Court more than 10 years ago, more than almost 10 years before she was asked to take this oath."
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2187.767,2188.125,That's correct.
1970.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2188.125,2198.291,It is the practice -- is it the practice for your clients to nonetheless to submit that oath and to have applicants signed it if they're willing to do so even though this Court's held is constitutionally invalid?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2198.291,2201.177,It was unquestionably done in this case.
1970.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2266.956,2272.316,"They haven't tell and although they are parties in the Cramp case, they hadn't received the word of our decision?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2272.316,2276.004,"Your Honor, the ways of a Government executive --"
1970.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2276.004,2277.578,"These are very parties in the case, aren't they?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2277.578,2279.953,They were indeed parties to the case Your Honor.
1970.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.854,2285.258,"Some other parties, overlapping party."
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2285.258,2288.997,"But there's no question that that was an error and a delinquency on their part, Your Honor."
1970.79,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2288.997,2300.778,And you don't know whether or not it's the -- it was at least the practice -- their practice to submit this form generally or whether this was just an individual idiosyncrasy?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2300.778,2302.321,No sir.
1970.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.437,2461.837,What about the belief part of this oath?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2466.551,2467.621,There are Your Honor and --
1970.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.621,2468.758,What's your position about that it might be --
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2468.758,2474.029,Our position is that there are two belief clauses and I think that's precisely what the appellant said.
1970.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.492,2488.566,What about the other part?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2488.566,2505.093,The other requirement is “I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of Florida by force and violence” and we support that and I should like to cite to the Court at this point the opinion of the lower court in Olson versus Phillips affirmed by this Court at 397 U.S. 317.
1970.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.404,2531.725,Don't we affirm judgments and not opinions?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2531.725,2542.776,"You do indeed, Your Honor and I'm urging upon the Court the reasoning of the Olson Court not the strict words which I'm -- which I certainly would not claim that this Court adopted per se."
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2594.096,2602.687,"Well in those cases, they had the protection of the Sixth Amendment and you don't have that protection?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2602.687,2603.168,"Excuse me, sir."
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2605.251,2614.53,"Yeah, it doesn't authorize you to require this oath of a teacher and I think that's the difference between what's you're talking about now?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2614.53,2618.265,"Your Honor, respectfully I disagree on this ground."
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2627.981,2634.543,"Well, I don't know who, well at least, I've never thought that."
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2637.556,2638.693,Precisely.
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2639.591,2643.713,But that doesn't mean that I have to agree that all oaths are good?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2643.713,2644.42,Certainly not.
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2644.784,2651.539,"But why then we get to this case, is this oath good, then I what my belief is?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2651.539,2651.986,Yes sir.
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2651.986,2657.225,What business is that of the State of Florida to what the belief of a teacher is?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2657.225,2664.19,We think is the first order of business as this Court pointed out in Shelton and as it pointed out before that in Abler.
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2670.882,2672.693,What about the typical law school students?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2672.693,2674.134,I beg your pardon?
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2674.134,2677.768,What about the typical law school students?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2677.768,2679.661,I'm not the quite --
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2679.661,2680.116,[Voice Overlap]
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2680.116,2681.841,-- there's anything about the minds of law school students --
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.841,2684.257,Or judging by the by the law school professors?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2684.257,2686.378,It applies to them indeed Your Honor.
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2693.894,2696.337,How can you place that [Attempt to Laughter]?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2696.337,2705.531,"At any rate, the State does, as this Court pointed out, have a vital concern in maintaining the security of the State and the question is, What can they do in that regard?"
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2830.9,2840.315,"But the whole problem about hearing as to the presidential oath, I don't know of any elected President as refused to take it?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2840.315,2843.902,"Your Honor, I don't think that's the test of the constitutionality of it."
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2843.902,2846.096,"Well, do you think there should be a hearing there?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2846.096,2847.771,I most surely do not sir.
1970.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.992,2885.547,"Well, you want to pursue your position that in case of a school teacher it's quite alright for a state to bar a school teacher for refusing to answer a question, “do you believe in the overthrow of the Government by force and violent?”"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2925.319,2885.547,Yes sir.
1970.79,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.526,2947.473,"So your -- I take it, your saying and if they say, Yes, I believe in the overthrow by force or violence or if they refuse to take the oath saying, I do not believe in it, that right then and there that Florida may bar the person from teaching, is just doesn't a preliminary question?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2947.473,2948.152,No sir.
1970.79,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2974.825,2987.833,"Mr. Slepin, let me -- somewhere along the line will you comment on the argument that the true subversive isn't going to be bothered by any loyalty oath in the first place."
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,2989.425,2992.515,I'll comment directly upon it at this point if I may sir.
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3089.384,3091.673,"May I ask you, when this law was passed?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3091.673,3095.541,"1949, I believe was the initial act Your Honor."
1970.79,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.541,3097.912,Was there any oath of any kind before that?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3097.912,3103.286,"I'm not aware of any Your Honor, but I certainly wouldn't be surprise if there were some kind of oath required."
1970.79,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3108.556,3112.3,Was the first one passed the same one as it is now in effect?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3112.3,3112.937,Yes sir --
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3112.937,3114.222,[Voice Overlap] Amendment?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3114.222,3128.737,"The same one, but far more abundant because it contains the provision which was excise by this Court in Cramp and then contained the other provisions which were excise by the court below and we're not arguing about those judicial excisions."
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3135.6,3140.285,I wonder if you know how many people had been discharged from office for failure to sign the oath?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3140.285,3147.075,I have no knowledge Your Honor of any persons being discharged other than those who are the parties to the cases now before the Court.
1970.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3147.075,3148.786,How many are they?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3148.786,3152.461,There are several thousand teachers in the state.
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3153.984,3155.092,U am not talking about [Voice Overlap]
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3155.092,3155.256,Oh!
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3160.571,3162.367,Two people?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3162.367,3164.502,"Four in all, I think Your Honor."
1970.79,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3165.644,3169.23,It is more to have tenure?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3169.23,3169.55,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3169.55,3173.624,Except you think maybe there was this loyalty oath before 1949?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3173.624,3180.609,I should suspect that there was but I know of no statute prior to 1949 and my research didn't reveal one.
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3180.609,3183.692,Teacher is on a year by year contract probable few the --
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3183.692,3188.793,"They are until the first few years of teaching Your Honor, where upon the gaining continuing contracts and --"
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3188.793,3190.604,That's in first two year?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3190.604,3192.312,Two or three years I believe Your Honor.
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3192.312,3196.093,"So, they'd have to take this oath three times?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3196.093,3199.785,"I strongly suspect that they would Your Honor, yes, but I'm not all --"
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3199.785,3213.824,"But suppose a teacher says as of this moment, I am not for advocating the avowal to overthrow the Government but I can't guarantee what my research and study might lead me to believe, would that be okay?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3213.824,3215.626,"No, I think not Your Honor."
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3215.626,3217.905,It just got to take it that way or else?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3217.905,3219.825,I think so Your Honor.
1970.79,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3219.825,3221.501,Just the way you do in this Court in the morning in the Court.
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3221.501,3227.856,Precisely in the -- I think it stands on the same feet as the oath sworn before this Court --
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3227.856,3234.535,"Except, I don't know about you but I didn't take an oath that I wouldn't overthrow the government, did you?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3234.535,3234.952,"Your Honor, --"
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3234.952,3235.965,You oath it.
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3238.015,3253.049,"It is not given to me to exercise judicial interpretation, but I suspect that the oath which she did take, has some very real meaning to it and I think it involves a very real commitment of belief as this Court stated in the Dodge (ph) case and belief means a promise."
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3253.049,3257.192,I agree with you and I don't agree with the other side that it's just symbolic.
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3276.991,3277.491,Your Honor --
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3277.491,3284.676,And that -- my whole point is where I mentioned before is no leeway in these joints here?
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3284.676,3289.346,There is no leeway in this respect because it applies to all state employees --
1970.79,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3289.346,3289.726,Alright.

1970.79,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3332.202,3333.994,I think Justice Blackmun had a question --
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3333.994,3335.429,"Yes, sir."
1970.79,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3335.429,3336.217,If he is not getting in --
1970.79,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3336.217,3337.56,"Well, perhaps its been answered."
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3345.48,3348.002,"For University personnel, Your Honor."
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3416.848,3435.504,"May I ask you is that oath as you interpret it means that the person who takes it has to swear that he will never under any circumstances or conditions, no matter how bad the Government maybe attempt to overthrow it?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3435.504,3436.265,No sir.
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3511.968,3520.248,"You are saying if the man had to face that situation, he should take, he should continue to abide by that oath?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3520.248,3521.536,"Your Honor, I can't --"
1970.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3521.536,3536.649,"Suppose the Government, I don't think it ever will and I hope that it never will, suppose it should, if ever Government like get this, would you say that he can than have to swear that he will not fight it?"
1970.79,1,42110,stephen_marc_slepin,,3536.649,3542.891,"Your Honor, I think that the Judge Leonard Hand put it, well, and it maybe very paradoxical."
1970.79,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3574.153,3577.515,I think you consumed all your time counsel.
