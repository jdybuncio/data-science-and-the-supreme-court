1979.73_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.154,We will hear arguments next this afternoon in the State of California v. the State of Nevada.
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,11.498,15.231,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.27,107.663,You say acquiescence is inapplicable here and your reason for it is that it is the United States that made the mistake?
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,107.663,112.024,"Yes, sir, it is our contention that the United States had no power to move the boundary under the Constitution."
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.036,126.992,Why is acquiescence any less persuasive in a situation like that than where it simply drafts a wrong decision of this Court or a mistaken decision of this Court or a mistake in a surveyor's note?
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,126.992,138.107,We contend that the failure of the power of the United States to move the boundary goes to California's claim of right in which acquiescence has always been applied on the claim of right in the State.
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,165.915,187.762,"I take it that if we adopt the Special Master's report and if you take the Special Master's -- it includes, what, 5,000 acres of land or so, that the United States purported to give to Nevada?"
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,187.762,191.678,It is approximately 218 square miles.
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,191.678,196.379,The land that the United States purported to give to Nevada and Nevada purported to convey to settlers.
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,196.379,198.037,"Forty-six hundred acres, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,198.037,210.65,"And then those titles resting in the change from U.S. to Nevada to owners, that land will now be in California."
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,210.65,213.282,That land would be in California by the Master's decree.
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,215.771,218.252,"Let me ask you, What is your interest?"
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,218.252,220.839,Interest in those patents?
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.839,225.575,"What is your interest, is it just a matter of jurisdiction and whether the land is in Nevada or not?"
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,225.575,227.292,"Yes, territorial sovereignty, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.292,227.858,That is it?
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,227.858,231.724,There is some question by California as to the legality of those private titles.
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,231.724,236.392,But there isn't anything like oil or minerals or --
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,236.392,237.186,"No, sir."
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.182,239.222,"-- taxes, or anything."
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,240.841,244.57,"Yes, sir, territorial sovereignty, the political integrity of the State."
1979.73_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,244.57,249.76,"The Special Master's report wouldn't have any impact on private titles, would it?"
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,249.76,251.877,"I don't think it does, particularly --"
1979.73_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,251.877,256.613,Even if we accept the Special Master it wouldn't have any impact on the private titles?
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,256.613,267.773,"Not according to Nevada. California and the United States have some question about it but I could find no parcel of land patented by both States, such as you had in Coffee v. Groover or Poole v. Fleeger."
1979.73_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,269.425,274.528,Would present landowners have to get their title quieted in California?
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,274.528,288.458,"Well, if the Special Master's line is decreed, this Court I remember in Maryland v. West Virginia that it was the duty of the law-making bodies of those two States to enact legislation validating the new found --"
1979.73_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,288.458,293.644,"Well, what if we accept the Special Master's report, are there some more proceedings before the Special Master that have to go on?"
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,293.644,305.569,"Yes, sir, he has made a recommendation that California be permitted to file an amended complaint in which the matter of titles and certain claims will be asserted against the United States by California."
1979.73_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,308.6,310.533,"But you are not concerned with that, is that correct?"
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,310.533,311.136,"No, sir."
1979.73_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,368.636,372.351,I must confess I really don't understand the argument.
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,391.837,395.002,"If it is first set on the ground and marked, that is the boundary."
1979.73_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,399.96,405.171,The acquiescence cannot move it even though the parties believe that is where it is?
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,405.171,412.968,"No, sir, because the actual moving was without constitutional authority and California's title is only so good as the title of the United States to that territory."
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,412.968,417.252,Where does the acquiescence principle come in?
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,417.252,423.074,"The Special Master in California urged it was a simple case of acquiescence, like any other boundary."
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.074,428.317,At least you can't acquiesce if the boundary is marked on the ground.
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,428.317,432.433,We cannot acquiesce and avoid a constitutional act.
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.433,449.815,"In Arkansas v. Tennessee, I think it was Chief Justice Hughes' opinion and in the Indiana v. Kentucky opinion, certainly the acquiescence principle was applied."
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,449.815,458.551,"In every case before this it was correctly applied, there was a claim with color of title in every case."
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.99,655.333,"Well, supposing in Pollard, this Court ultimately held that Congress had no right to admit the State of Mississippi or Alabama, whichever it was, the way it did because it had a right to be admitted on an equal footing with the other State, supposing that for 90 years each of the States had acquiesced in the boundaries set by the United States at the time it admitted the State of Missisippi, do you think acquiescence would have been out of place there?"
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,655.333,660.637,I think it would have been applied there if there was a survey on the ground at the time of the admission.
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,663.093,667.043,But the statute admitting the State to the Union prescribed --
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,667.043,668.786,Prescribed the boundary.
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.092,672.527,So that is the critical thing.
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,672.527,675.14,The United States would have been free to go out there and set it.
1979.73_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,675.14,681.968,You think the critical aspect of the acquiescence doctrine is the fact the boundary has been marked on the ground?
1979.73_orig,0,33213,james_h_thompson,,681.968,683.355,"Yes, sir."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1617.456,1620.705,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.562,1673.476,"There wasn't any confusion about the line was before 1872, at least that it was marked on the ground, almost all of it."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1673.476,1677.228,"It was from Lake Tahoe north, certainly, Mr. Justice."
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1677.228,1679.081,And so there was that mark.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1682.982,1693.896,"It is our understanding that there were substantial doubts raised, primarily by the General Land Office, as to the accuracy of the original Houghton-Ives line."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.874,1699.138,"Which was supposed to be what, to reflect what?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1699.138,1702.124,To reflect the 120th Meridian on --
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1702.124,1702.839,On the ground.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1702.839,1704.437,"-- on the ground, exactly."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.829,1745.142,"Well, suppose the two States in 18 -- when was it -- Von Schmidt -- '72?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1745.142,1746.21,72.
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.21,1769.109,"Suppose the two States had got together and said, gee, I think it is probably a mistake, they used this mark on the ground and that is where it was when Nevada was admitted and that is the line that both the legislatures accepted at the time of Nevada's admission, anyway."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1771.673,1772.663,"Yes, they did, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.663,1778.206,"Well, suppose they had said then, well, we want to change it, we want to change our boundary."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1782.16,1784.164,"I believe that it would have been, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.632,1791.38,"I know you must have to argue that, don't you?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1791.38,1796.186,"Well, whether it is characterized as agreement or by acquiescence -- or as acquiescence."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.186,1799.595,Wouldn't that have required the consent of Congress?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1799.595,1802.642,"I believe there is a question as to that, Mr. Justice."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.506,1823.347,"Well, what about my example, what is the argument they wouldn't have had the consent of Congress if the two States wanted to change their boundary?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1823.347,1838.948,"Well, I believe Justice Field's first point, at least, was that in effect this was not an agreement that altered the political balance of the States or affected sovereignty to such an extent as to require express congressional ratification or a compact within the meaning of that clause."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.143,1892.387,"Well, the United States, though, based on the old line conveyed in Nevada some land that was -- you claim was in California."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1892.387,1893.573,"That is right, Mr. Justice."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.573,1900.932,"Well, so you infer United States acquiescence or approval of that agreement of moving the line?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1900.932,1909.994,"I believe so, because immediately after the new line was drawn the General Land Office directed that its public surveys be redrawn to close upon the new line."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.653,1922.932,"Upon the subsequent line, yes."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1922.932,1924.164,So as a matter of equity --
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.164,1927.055,You say California received new lands.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1938.202,1941.554,"That is correct, it did."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.314,1945.226,"Otherwise it would have been in Nevada, under the old line."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1945.226,1946.904,"That is right, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.904,1950.143,That is where you say the United States acquiesced?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,1950.143,1951.767,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1984.415,2000.696,"Is it fair to say that California in this case depends upon treating acquiescence in the same way and having the same consequences as an affirmative agreement, an affirmative express agreement on the boundary?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2000.696,2008.19,"I believe that is basically one of the two points that we would believe militates for this line, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.806,2061.076,Neither of you is very enthusiastic about a brand new survey.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2061.076,2085.197,"If the 120th Meridian is to be the boundary between Nevada and California and if the Court rejects the concept of acquiescence or acceptance of the lines which have been respected by both the States we believe that the only proper thing to do would be to order a new survey, as the Court did of course in the New Mexico case."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.273,2114.152,"I don't know about Nevada, but at least I take it that Judge Van Pelt was not particularly enthusiastic about this, he offered it as an alternative."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2114.152,2125.54,"That is right, Your Honor, he pointed out, and I think legitimately, that there is no boundary that could be not more precisely defined today than it could have been a hundred years ago."
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.561,2148.756,"Do you think when this description was originally agreed upon that people knew it would end up in the middle of Lake Tahoe, the meeting of the two lines?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2148.756,2159.211,"Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that land was very important to people and very little attention was paid to it."
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.909,2217.135,"If they had just as accurate instruments in 1872 or 1860 as they have got today, and the same people were doing the two surveys, would the 120th be in the same place?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2217.135,2223.357,"Your Honor, it is our belief that if --"
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2223.357,2226.972,Is it denied or admitted or what is the position?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2230.882,2245.336,"The evidence before the Special Master indicates that if an accurate survey were made today, California's line would extend anywhere from 1,200 to 1,700 feet into what is now Nevada if the North Lake Tahoe --"
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2245.336,2252.598,"Suppose an accurate survey were made 100 years from now, then the 120th might be in a different place?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2252.598,2254.884,I am not sure there would be a significant difference.
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.71,2267.769,That is based on corrections on the ground conforming to an abstract description.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2270.293,2272.741,"That is right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.231,2278.525,"Well, there is not supposed to be."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2278.525,2278.885,No.
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.885,2282.284,It isn't an accepted notion that meridians are traveling?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2282.284,2290.242,That is right.
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.502,2323.33,Unless there has been acquiescence.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2323.33,2325.006,"That is right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2345.908,2358.881,"Well, what about Justice Field's comment in the old Indiana case that it wouldn't significantly alter the balance of power between the States as a ground for allowing acquiescence?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2358.881,2364.557,That might be used to argue and support such a different location.
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2364.557,2371.905,"Justice Field didn't know how valuable land around Lake Tahoe was going to be in the 20th Century, did he?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2371.905,2375.057,"He did not, Mr. Chief Justice, although he did come from California."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.627,2478.001,Am I right in thinking that Nevada has no western boundary except the eastern boundary of California?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2478.001,2482.881,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that that is the accurate description."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.574,2516.107,There is no other State involved?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2516.107,2521.049,"No, there is not, this is solely between California and Nevada."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.049,2528.694,What precipitated this dispute; I mean why are you all jerc if you have been so happy all these years?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2528.694,2531.758,"There were two principal factors, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2544.838,2548.345,You mean the Von Schmidt --
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2548.345,2551.484,Von Schmidt was about --
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.484,2554.673,Houghton-Ives wasn't and neither was Von Schmidt.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2554.673,2557.004,"That is right, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.004,2558.528,So that is inaccurate.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2558.528,2573.801,So it is not an accurate depiction of the 120th Meridian and there was some fear that taxes and criminal prosecutions and acts of the like could be challenged on the basis that in fact the California-Nevada boundary as set forth in law was not being followed by the States.
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.801,2577.357,So it is a quiet title action?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2577.357,2578.459,"In the nature of one, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.459,2579.265,Yes.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2579.265,2579.609,Of course the --
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.609,2581.748,What is the other thing that precipitated it?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2581.748,2597.128,"The second concern that came to our attention was a ruling of the Department of the Interior which seemed to cast doubt upon the validity of titles which were granted in reliance upon the old replaced boundary, the Von Schmidt boundary."
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2635.323,2638.605,To homestead.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2638.605,2641.872,"To homestead, to internal improvement lands and to school lands."
1979.73_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2641.872,2648.891,"I suppose your position is that the United States has acquiesced, too?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2648.891,2651.095,We would hope that that would be the position.
1979.73_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2651.095,2658.95,"Well, I thought you just argued here a while ago that the United States has recognized the Von Schmidt line."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2658.95,2660.187,It has.
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2660.187,2668.226,And yet I thought you argued a moment ago that the Interior Department has made some nonacquiescence acts recently.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2668.226,2671.09,"Very recently, in the 1960's."
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.361,2699.996,"Is that dispute just between California and the United States; it doesn't involve Nevada, does it?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2699.996,2710.99,"Yes, it would involve Nevada, Your Honor, because Nevada has made a substantial number of selections, the validity of which could be cast into doubt by the decision --"
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2710.99,2718.187,"Well, do you think -- how would that dispute be resolved in this case?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2723.045,2724.265,"They could, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2725.722,2732.476,Do you think the Solicitor General has got power to waive sovereign immunity?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2732.476,2735.518,We believe that they would be properly before this Court.
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.402,2756.935,"Well certainly in the recent case that we wrote in Idaho v. Washington and Oregon, we held that even though perhaps only political sovereignty was involved, the United States was not an indispensable party and its intervention was not required, didn't we."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2756.935,2759.661,"And I would agree in this case, Your Honor, that the United States --"
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.661,2764.007,It is not a necessary party indispensable to settle your dispute?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2764.007,2765.588,Right.
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.588,2772.837,The question is whether you could go ahead and impede the United States in this case.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2774.842,2775.692,That is right.
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2811.796,2813.606,I have one more question.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2826.026,2835.667,"We asked that the Von Schmidt line be declared to be the accurate one, Your Honor, it was basically in the nature of a quiet title as has been suggested."
1979.73_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.963,2940.272,Do both Nevada and California recognize the Act of Congress in the 'Sixties as making the canalized Colorado River the boundary where California and Nevada have joint boundaries?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,2940.272,2941.851,"Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1979.73_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3018.861,3022.531,"Well, that is not involved before us right now, is it?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3022.531,3025.78,"No, only to the extent that the Special Master --"
1979.73_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3025.78,3038.478,"If we just happen to agree with you on this acquiescence issue, we don't need to do anything else, do we?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3038.478,3042.098,"Certainly not at this time, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.098,3051.758,"Well, if we did nothing else that would mean we acquiesced in the Master's recommendation that you continue this process, would it not?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3051.758,3052.877,I assume it would.
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.877,3057.055,You have never referred to him any issue about titles.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3061.993,3062.747,That is right.
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.747,3073.441,"So we would have to expand his reference, wouldn't we, if he was going to go on and do something besides what he has done now?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3073.441,3082.046,"We have filed a motion, Your Honor, for the Commission to file an amended complaint which expressly raises this question."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.046,3084.124,So that we haven't acted on that?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3084.124,3085.366,And you have not acted on that.
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.366,3112.491,"So in the absence of that, we would have to simply resolve the issue of the boundary line and if this Special Master went beyond the reference to suggest private title litigation, a decree reflecting that recommendation would probably be beyond the reference, wouldn't it?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3112.491,3114.051,"I am not sure, Your Honor."
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3131.906,3139.456,"There are other forums for settling these title questions, they don't have to be settled here."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3139.456,3141.004,"Your Honor, they may have to be."
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3141.004,3142.658,Why is that?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3145.892,3149.641,The controversy may involve both States and the United States.
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3149.641,3153.481,"Well, but not against each other."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3153.481,3156.0,We know of no direct instance in which both States --
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3156.0,3159.464,"Well, then it can be settled somewhere else."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3159.464,3161.037,To select the same parcel.
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.623,3214.618,"If we were to grant your motion for the amended complaint, do we know now whether Nevada will be in agreement with that, assuming we go with you on the main issues?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3214.618,3221.114,"By agreement, Mr. Chief Justice, you are referring to resolution of the question of titles?"
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3221.114,3221.998,Right.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3221.998,3224.105,We would have every hope that we --
1979.73_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3224.105,3226.096,We don't know that now.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3232.803,3235.884,"We can't speak for them, really."
1979.73_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3357.599,3371.652,"These proceedings would determine the title to the United States and that is not a very informal participation if you are going to present the United States with a decree, is it?"
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3371.652,3377.767,"That is true, Mr. Justice White, and it may be necessary that they join formally at a later time."
1979.73_orig,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3435.389,3452.996,"Well, you think it is just as though there was a dispute at the time about where the boundary was, that it had never been marked on the ground definitely and people were in a big argument about where it was and so the two States agreed to have a survey."
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3459.026,3462.286,"It is very close to that, Your Honor, if not precisely that."
1979.73_orig,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3462.286,3465.995,The only thing is that there was a line on the ground.
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3465.995,3469.497,The difference is that there was a line and the States have accepted it.
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.059,3481.271,All the time thinking that they were locating the 120th Meridian?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3481.271,3484.167,"That is right, that is correct."
1979.73_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3501.638,3505.901,The alternative line being the 43rd west of D.C.?
1979.73_orig,1,33092,jan_s_stevens,,3505.901,3521.515,"Nevada's alternative being the 43rd west of D.C. and Nevada's second alternative being another line altogether drawn from a different location at Oregon border, which was represented as being the 120th."
1979.73_orig,2,33213,james_h_thompson,,3561.738,3562.882,"Yes, sir."
1979.73_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3587.064,3592.662,Wasn't the understanding that the 43rd was the same as the 120th?
1979.73_orig,2,33213,james_h_thompson,,3592.662,3599.872,"No, sir, We have argued that Congress has recognized that they were different, because there was actually a survey."
1979.73_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3599.872,3602.747,At the time was it recognized they were different?
1979.73_orig,2,33213,james_h_thompson,,3602.747,3605.426,"Yes, sir, in 1850 Congress recognized there was a difference."
1979.73_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3611.662,3622.705,"Yes, but what was the eastern boundary -- the eastern boundary of California wasn't the 43rd, it was --"
1979.73_orig,2,33213,james_h_thompson,,3622.705,3628.91,But California argues that the Congress can change it and take part of Nevada and give it to California.
1979.73_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3628.91,3632.296,And the Territory of Nevada was created right up against it.
1979.73_orig,2,33213,james_h_thompson,,3632.296,3637.518,The eastern boundary of California but the State was specified at the 43rd Meridian west of Washington.
1979.73_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3637.518,3642.921,At least you don't say that the real boundary was contained in the conference report.
1979.73_orig,2,33213,james_h_thompson,,3642.921,3645.858,No.
1979.73_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3647.576,3652.549,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
