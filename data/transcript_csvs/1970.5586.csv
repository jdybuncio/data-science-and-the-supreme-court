1970.5586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.974,"We'll hear arguments next in number 5586, Bell against Burson."
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,13.308,16.838,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,191.904,193.983,Can I interrupt you with one question?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,193.983,194.101,Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,194.101,199.735,"Does the state concede that Mr. Bell was not negligent, is that conceded?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,200.173,207.228,I think it would be improper and Mrs. Beasley shakes her head if I said they conceded it as will appear in the description of the facts.
1970.5586,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,224.092,227.765,But is that res judicata in any subsequent negligence suit?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,227.765,228.921,No it's not.
1970.5586,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,240.919,246.104,"There are no -- do I understand that this Court proceeding, I know it was a Court proceeding and --"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,246.104,246.137,Yes.
1970.5586,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,246.137,248.707,--is still part of the administrative procedure?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,248.707,252.579,"No, it's an appeal that they know will appeal from the administrative procedure."
1970.5586,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,252.579,257.339,"Well, but it is not enough of a Court proceeding to be res judicata in a negligence suit?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,257.339,258.252,That's correct.
1970.5586,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,270.475,272.016,But of course they're not parties to this --
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,272.016,274.153,"That's correct, there are not parties."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,274.153,284.747,"To the extent that it was settled between the state and your client was a bonafide in judicial finding, wasn't it of no negligence?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,284.747,286.326,"Yes, I think -- I think that would be proper to say --"
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,286.326,288.589,"Well, what's its significance to this?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,288.589,293.853,"Well, its significance I think fits into the overall scheme."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,302.429,306.413,"No, what -- no, what I was trying to get at, why the appeal?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,312.763,314.15,Very good question.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,314.467,315.512,What's the answer?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,315.512,322.98,"Well, I think the answer is that as the state would have us determine the Act, there's no reason to appeal because there's nothing to discuss at the appeal."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,322.98,324.855,Which is what the Georgia Supreme Court has held?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,324.855,326.69,"The Georgia Court of Appeals held in fact, yes there's --"
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,326.69,326.811,Irrelevant?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,326.811,327.82,"Yes, there's --"
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,327.82,329.826,The fault was irrelevant.
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,329.826,339.802,The things that actually can be considered first at the administrative hearing and then secondly at the Court of Appeal from the administrative hearing are very much circumscribed.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,360.028,367.864,"The license is restored if an action between the injured party and the driver, the driver wins on the basis of no fault?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,367.864,369.832,That's right.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,386.256,387.404,May I ask you one more question --
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,387.404,387.586,Yes.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,387.586,392.554,--while we interrupted you or I have.
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,399.628,405.761,"I don't think there is any question and certainly, we are not questioning that here, and of course your question then is why if they can do that."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,426.051,434.328,"It does mean though that one, your answer means that one doesn't have a constitutional right to remain uninsured?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,434.328,448.01,"Well, let's rephrase it slightly I would say that if one is going to be insured, then the burden must be equally distributed on all persons and one does have a constitutional right not to be discriminated against as to who will have insurance and who not."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,448.01,450.81,Why did Mr. Bell not have insurance?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,450.81,466.608,"Well now, the case (Inaudible) and I didn't represent even the lower court but I'm told by his attorney that as a Methodist minister, this was not provided in his salary and he did not obtain the insurance, he's not required to have it."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,466.608,471.258,"Of course, I'm not sure that I heard your answer, what did you say about a Methodist minister?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,471.258,481.313,He's a person of very low salary and the lawyer who represented him at the lower level said he simply did not have or did not allocate funds for insurance.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,481.313,483.125,They're not all of low salary?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,483.125,483.824,I'm sorry?
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,483.824,485.103,You say they're not all of low salary.
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,485.103,498.591,"Oh I suppose not, but I gather that it was a financial reason, he did not decide to place money on insurance and he was not required to do so by the state, thank you."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,498.591,503.184,And Georgia doesn't require everyone to get some accident to have insurance?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,503.184,504.19,That's correct.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,505.699,512.494,"If it's other people that he hasn't been talked, he just need to --"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,512.494,514.726,"Well, yes that's true."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,527.409,535.196,But Georgia can't claim that they're using an accident as a trigger to require insurance?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,535.196,535.882,That's right.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,535.882,537.481,Because that isn't what happened?
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,537.481,539.17,That's correct.
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,578.187,583.395,"And if you just take the judgment, you don't need to carry insurance either."
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,583.395,587.953,"Well, that's a complicated question but I think the answer is yes without going into it."
1970.5586,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,587.953,590.759,You may get your license suspended but --
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,590.759,601.713,"Yes, by the time there was judgment probably your license has been suspended and reinstated and then of course you would have to pay the judgment or face suspension yet a second time."
1970.5586,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,601.713,603.333,Do you mind raising your voice a little Mrs. Rindskopf.
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,603.333,604.713,"I'm sorry, yes."
1970.5586,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.713,611.329,"You anticipate that if you prevailed here, that Georgia would change its law to require insurance as a condition preceded?"
1970.5586,0,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,611.329,619.802,"No I don't, I think that the state and let me add that the state keeps no legislative history but I have done some looking into some of the journals."
1970.5586,1,20577,dorothy_t_beasley,,1496.29,1499.666,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.5586,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1558.587,1560.275,Less security?
1970.5586,1,20577,dorothy_t_beasley,,1560.275,1573.57,In the amount that is claimed by the injured party under affidavit with the statements of the attending physician to back up and to substantiate his claim.
1970.5586,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1573.807,1579.857,"Now, the claimer -- should they claim a $100,000.00, you just put up the bond to at least a $100,000.00?"
1970.5586,1,20577,dorothy_t_beasley,,1579.857,1601.183,"That isn't quite so in practice Mr. Justice because the director does have a discretion to increase the amount or decrease the amount and although the statute says that it is not to be below the amount that's claimed, he does in fact do so if he believes it's too much and it did so in this case."
1970.5586,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.129,1624.598,There is no sealing on the amount?
1970.5586,1,20577,dorothy_t_beasley,,1624.598,1639.322,"Yes there is, that's $10,000.00, the security is $10,000.00 for a single person's death or $20,000.00 for one accident and $5,000.00 for property damage which is the same amount of minimum insurance that's required."
1970.5586,2,23050,elizabeth_roediger_rindskopf,,3387.508,3388.213,Thank you.
1970.5586,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.392,3538.297,"Thank you Mrs. Rindscopf, thank you Mrs. Beasley."
